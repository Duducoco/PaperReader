    "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a leading cause of chronic disability worldwide, commonly diagnosed using radiographic imaging and evaluated using the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading scale. X-rays would require manual interpretation, which is long, most likely to inter-observer variation, and could not be used in mass screening. The research provides a hypothesis that an automated model that relies on deep learning can be used to classify the severity of KOA and identify it with the use of X-ray images of the knees. A variety of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) paired with attention-enhanced modules (e.g., CBAM) is used, as well as architecture or variants including Transformer blocks and Capsule Networks. The model pipeline will entail the robust preprocessing methods-image normalization, histogram equalization, Gaussian noise, and rigorous data augmentation. The classification of the images is done on the KL scale (grades 0-4) and it is trained through cross-entropy loss and an adaptive optimizer such as Adam. The evaluation measures are accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. Nevertheless, CNN+Transformer and CNN-CBAM models had the highest accuracy of 96.59% and 96.15%, which is better compared to the traditional architectures such as CNN-VGG16 and MobileNetV2 architectures. Grad-CAM was used to offer visual explanation, indicating pathological locations of joints, the demand of clinical trust. The models have been compared with the known traditional classifiers (SVM, Random Forest) over handcrafted features (HOG, LBP) and deep models performed better in all of the metrics. This paper proves that deep learning may contribute massively to diagnostic accuracy in KOA identification and unloading radiologists. In the future, the system to assess multi-joint osteoarthritis will be expanded, and real-time inference will be incorporated into clinical practice."

These structures are well-suited for generating radio frequency (RF) signals in systems such as radar, mobile defense platforms, and satellite communications. GNLTL operation is based on a coaxial configuration with ferrite cores magnetically saturated by the superposition of axial and azimuthal fields, resulting in RF oscillations at the output. This study utilizes a 60-cm gyromagnetic line to generate GHz-range RF signals with the axial magnetic bias supplied by a solenoid integrated into a custom test bench. A high-voltage pulse generator fed two GNLTLs built using two Amidon Ni-Zn ferrites of distinct size (models FB43-201 and FB43-101). The objective is to assess how variations in ferrite geometry (specifically inner and outer ferrite diameters) affect the transmission line's performance. Results indicate that ferrite dimensions significantly influence signal characteristics, underscoring the role of magnetic saturation in determining the efficiency of GNLTL. These findings support the optimization of GNLTL design for advanced RF applications."

Our algorithm employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance resource utilization by fully leveraging the probability distribution of task execution times, rather than relying solely on a single execution time estimate. Building on this foundation, we introduce several targeted optimizations to traditional Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) to overcome the limitations of static scheduling strategies when addressing the uncertainty of execution makespans. We developed a prototype system, named scDAG, which is a functionally extended and enhanced version of the CloudSim framework. Through implementation and experiments on scDAG, our algorithm demonstrates a superior approach to workflow scheduling. In addition, we analyze and compare the experimental data, revealing significant improvements. Our work ultimately achieves better performance by minimizing workflow scheduling time."

    "abstract": "Sound field control (SFC) aims to accurately reproduce a desired sound field within a specified region, which requires both adaptation to input signal characteristics and precise estimation of acoustic paths between loudspeakers and microphones. To meet these demands, two adaptive algorithms are proposed. The first is a signal-adaptive multichannel filteredx least-mean-square (MCFxLMS) filter designed to handle nonstationary input signals such as speech and music. The second is an acoustic path tracking algorithm that incorporates an input signal decorrelation strategy, enabling robust tracking of multichannel room impulse responses (RIRs) even under highly correlated excitation. Additionally, an alternating modeswitching mechanism is introduced to dynamically activate each algorithm based on predefined criteria. This approach can reduce computational complexity in large-scale multichannel systems while preserving sound field fidelity within the control region."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to intrusion detection by integrating traditional signature-based methods with the contextual understanding capabilities of the GPT-2 Large Language Model (LLM). As cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated, particularly in distributed, heterogeneous, and resource-constrained environments such as those enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), the need for dynamic and adaptive Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) becomes increasingly urgent. While traditional methods remain effective for detecting known threats, they often fail to recognize new and evolving attack patterns. In contrast, GPT-2 excels at processing unstructured data and identifying complex semantic relationships, making it well-suited to uncovering subtle, zero-day attack vectors. We propose a hybrid IDS framework that merges the robustness of signature-based techniques with the adaptability of GPT-2-driven semantic analysis. Experimental evaluations on a representative intrusion dataset demonstrate that our model enhances detection accuracy by 6.3%, reduces false positives by 9.0%, and maintains near real-time responsiveness. These results affirm the potential of language model integration to build intelligent, scalable, and resilient cybersecurity defences suited for modern connected environments."

The current challenges are both hardware and software. The main research challenges are diverse and varied, and focus on self-configuration, clustering, synchronization time, decision-making, analysis of detected data and security. To date, very little work has been done in the field of security, and this does not take into account possible developments relating to the material itself, whose physical configuration underpins exchange and self-reconfiguration protocols. In this paper, we propose a solution that takes current security concerns into account, and which may be able to adapt to a future evolution of programmable matter based on modular robots. This solution is based on resource-saving cryptographic mechanisms to implement a robust authentication solution and a flexible key management mechanism coupled with a confidential data exchange of the structure formed."

    "abstract": "Existing speech emotion recognition (SER) methods commonly suffer from the lack of high-quality large-scale corpus, partly due to the complex, psychological nature of emotion which makes accurate labeling difficult and time consuming. Recently, transfer learning based methods that exploit the encoders pretrained on large-scale speech corpus (e.g., Wav2Vec2.0 and HuBERT) have shown strong potential for downstream SER tasks. However, task-specific finetuning remains necessary for various conversational scenarios of different topics, speakers and languages to achieve satisfactory performance. It generally requires costly encoder retraining for individual SER tasks. To address this issue, we propose to train an adapter with local attributes for efficient transfer learning. Specifically, a weighted average pooling-Transformer (WAP-Transformer) is proposed as a lightweight backbone to enrich the frame-level representation. An adapter with teacher-student branches is exploited for task-agnostic transfer learning, where the student branch is jointly optimized via mask prediction and self-distillation objectives, and the teacher branch is obtained online from the student via exponential moving average (EMA). Meanwhile, local attributes are learned from the teacher branch via unsupervised clustering, which aims to act as a universal model that provides additional semantic-rich supervisions. A statistical attentive pooling (SAP) module is proposed to obtain utterance representation for finetuning. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed adapter with local attributes, extensive experiments have been conducted on IEMOCAP. Superior performance has been reported, compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods in similar settings."

Conventional clinical assessments and cognitive tests require expert clinicians and are time-consuming. Therefore, developing rapid and reliable in-house detection methods is highly desirable. Prior studies have identified speech-based early markers of dementia, motivating the application of machine learning for automated detection. This study investigates the effectiveness of optimized prosodic features, with a focus on pause-related metrics, for dementia classification. Experimental evaluation of 15 selected features shows that pause and formant features are the most discriminative, achieving improved classification performance over the original 45-feature set. These findings suggest that concise, targeted feature sets can enhance automated speech-based dementia detection."

The system comprises heterogeneous storage nodes and autonomously reallocates data blocks based on their usage. In such environments, effective performance of the storage nodes must be considered when deciding data block migration. Accurate estimation of effective performance is essential for selecting appropriate destinations, but frequent data collection from many nodes incurs overhead and can degrade performance. This paper proposes a four-parameter sigmoid-based model to approximate effective throughput and an optimized eight-byte encoding scheme to reduce communication cost. Evaluation results show that the model closely fits actual throughput, with the encoding introducing only about 1.2% increase in residual sum of squares despite rounding."

Traditional manual feeding methods are prone to time and operational errors, which lead to irregular feeding patterns for experimental animals, affecting the accuracy and reproducibility of experimental data. Therefore, designing an intelligent and efficient automatic feeder for experimental animals is significant. We designed software and hardware in this study. We developed the main program, the feeding control subprogram, the automatic leftover cleaning control subprogram, and the automatic water supply control subprogram. The hardware comprised the food supply control circuit, automatic leftover cleaning control circuit, and infrared sensing water supply circuit. The developed system employed Keil 5 for programming and Proteus 8.17 for simulation. Keil5 was used for code development and compilation, as well as program debugging, providing an integrated development environment. Proteus 8.17 was used for circuit design and simulation, building virtual hardware circuits. The developed feeding system operates precisely and conducts quantitative control, automatic operation, and remote interaction.

While deep learning has advanced for general object detection, current models exhibit performance degradation when confronted with visually subtle, low-frequency, or small-scale damage types, especially under imbalanced training conditions. Therefore, we developed a scalable vehicle damage classification system based on the mixture of experts (MoE) architecture. Three model variants are introduced in the system: (1) RawMoE, which relies on raw RGB inputs; (2) ResMoE-50, incorporating pretrained ResNet-50 feature embeddings; and (3) CropResMoE-50, which integrates region-based cropping, scale-aware analysis, and focal loss for class imbalance mitigation. Evaluated on the Car Damage Detection dataset, the final model achieved 89.30% test accuracy and macro-average precision of 91.83%, demonstrating robust performance across categories and object sizes.

The design offers several advantages, including a reduced component count, a straightforward circuit configuration, lower voltage stress, and a broad input voltage range. The soft-switching capability of the converter enables high switching frequencies while maintaining high power conversion efficiency. Detailed investigations are conducted in various operation modes and their corresponding equivalent circuits throughout the operating cycle. To validate the converter's performance, a downscaled 1.2 kW simulation and a 350 W experimental prototype were developed. The results demonstrate the converter's ability to achieve a wide output voltage gain while maintaining a stable output voltage across a wide range of low input voltages. The prototype achieved maximum power conversion efficiencies of 98% in simulation and 96.5% in experimental testing under full load conditions, attributed to the converter's ability to minimize switching losses at rated power."

However, similar to most neural network-based schemes, LIC is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To mitigate the influence of adversarial attacks, adversarial training is usually adopted to finetune the network. This paper proposes efficient adversarial attack and training methods for LIC, by proposing three losses based on the original image, adversarial image, and reconstructed image. For the attack, we study the effects of three proposed losses on four qualities of classical factorized-prior and hyperprior models. For the adversarial training, all the proposed three losses are used in the finetuning for the three attack scenarios, respectively. We find that using the loss between the adversarial output and the original image achieves strong defense performance against various attacks, improving RD cost by up to 68.6%. Furthermore, we show that updating only the decoding during adversarial training along with reducing the number of iterations, can reduce the training time by up to 82.9% without compromising the defense performance."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel dominant color extraction method that incorporates salient region analysis to better reflect human visual impressions. Traditional dominant color extraction methods treat the entire image uniformly, often resulting in dominant colors that do not correspond to visually important regions. In this method, at first stage, images are classified into “landscape images” and “non-landscape images,” and then perform appropriate processing for each. For landscape images, dominant colors are extracted using conventional clustering over the entire image. For non-landscape images, we use saliency maps to detect regions of interest, and extract the most frequent color within these regions as the dominant color. Additionally, in order to evaluate the quality of dominant color, we construct color feature vectors based on predefined reference colors, enabling image retrieval tasks by multiple key-colors. Experimental results demonstrate that our method provides dominant colors that better match human perception, and improves the accuracy of image retrieval using color-based emotional representation. This approach shows promise for applications in affective computing, multimedia retrieval, and content recommendation."

    "abstract": "Surface dielectric barrier discharges (SDBDs) driven by repetitive nanosecond pulses have shown significant potential in various applications, including flow control, energy conversion, icing mitigation, combustion, and ignition. Compared to traditional two-electrode SDBDs, the threeelectrode configuration has garnered more attention due to its higher deposited energy and distinct discharge modes, making it particularly promising for thermal-based applications such as flow control and ignition. The three-electrode SDBD under repetitive nanosecond pulses can operate in two discharge modes, i.e., streamer discharge and spark discharge, with transitions between them influenced by various parameters. Prior research has identified surface charge accumulation from previous pulses as a key factor in determining these mode transitions. However, the charge accumulation behavior in the three-electrode configuration remains insufficiently understood. In this work, the streamer dynamics and charge accumulation behavior of repetitively nanosecond-pulsed three-electrode SDBDs were investigated experimentally and numerically. The spatial and temporal evolutions of streamer morphology and electric field were obtained to analyze surface charge distribution. The results revealed that the final charge distribution was primarily determined by the secondary surface streamer developing within the primary streamer channel. Furthermore, simulation results provided insights into the charge transport mechanism within the streamer channel."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a method for synthesizing vowel-like tones that exhibit pitch circularity, an auditory illusion in which a cyclic sequence of tones appears to endlessly ascend or descend in pitch. Such illusions have traditionally been achieved using synthetic sinusoidal tones, such as the Shepard tone. However, the timbral characteristics of these tones and their relationship to speech have not yet been thoroughly investigated. Aiming at potential applications in music and auditory research, we attempt to synthesize sounds that simultaneously evoke vowel perception and pitch circularity. In our method, we construct a 12 -tone scale from a given vowel by varying its fundamental frequency (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{F 0}$</tex>) while preserving its spectral envelope. To induce pitch circularity, we apply pitch-dependent attenuation to the odd harmonics relative to the even harmonics. Subjective listening experiments were conducted to evaluate the pitch perception and vowel identification accuracy of the synthesized tones. Using five Japanese vowels, “A,” “I,” “U,” “E,” “O,” the proposed method demonstrated stronger pitch circularity while maintaining high vowel identification accuracy (average F1-score: 99.7%). Audio demos of the proposed method are available online."

As high performance computing (HPC) enters the exascale era, these models are advancing towards unprecedented high-resolution, generating explosive data volumes. In this case, Input/Output (I/O) operations have become a major performance bottleneck, hindering scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we focus on optimizing the I/O performance for the Yin-He Global Spectral Model (YHGSM). To alleviate these bottleneck, we implement a solution centered on a decoupled, asynchronous I/O paradigm. By integrating the XIOS framework, our method externalizes I/O tasks to dedicated server processes, which we enhance with a custom data transfer algorithm that strategically buffers data to maximize the overlap between computation and communication. The resulting integrated system is referred to as YHGSM-XIOS. The experimental results demonstrate substantial performance gains, showing that at a scale of 5,120 processes, the YHGSM-XIOS scheme reduces I/O overhead from 43.08 % to a mere 5.27 % and achieves an overall speedup of 2.31 times compared to the baseline system."

To investigate the failure and assess possible improvements, a benchtop test stand was constructed to evaluate the performance of a single stage board. This test stand features a Pulse Forming Network (PFN) that operates at 6 kV and 6 kA, with a repetition rate exceeding 60 Hz, simulating real operational conditions. By utilizing this setup, we seek to gain a better understanding of the failure mechanisms, refine the switch designs, and ultimately develop a more reliable alternative for the extraction kicker power supplies."

Under a series of reasonable assumptions, translational accelerations in the surge and sway directions, along with yaw angular acceleration, are decoupled and expressed as combinations of measurable variables and corresponding parameters. To support experimental implementation, a real-time variable measurement system is developed, along with a denoising technique to handle inherently noisy acceleration data.

Our Semantic Integrating Activity Recognition Network (SInAR-Net) enriches visual representations with language-based semantic information to construct complex spatio-temporal actor relationship. For efficient learning, we transfer the semantic knowledge via pre-extracted text features of contextual information generated through multiple prompt generations. Then, we construct multi-modal relationship between visual actor features and semantic text features using our semantic integration module. We ensure no drastic additional calculation cost by alleviating the use of LVLM in the inference stage, as our semantic integration module intrinsically learned the cross-modal semantic knowledge. Experiments on WSGAR benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance of our method, and ablation studies show the effectiveness of our novel semantic understanding components."

A dynamic optimization of SU transmission power to reduce PU interference and maximize network performance is also a serious challenge. The following paper, GWO-PowerGuard, an adaptive power control framework using the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm, to mitigate such problem, is proposed. The power control problem formulations follow the framework that models under the power control as a multi-objective optimization problem, in terms of SU throughput and PU interference. The usage of GWO allows searching the solution space efficiently and reaching the optimal power levels of each SU, dynamically adapting to the PU activity and to alterations in the network. Large-scale simulations were carried out at different SU densities, PU activity rates and channel conditions. The model suggested had the PU interference suppression of up to -95.4 dBm at low SU densities, and the values below -86.5 dBm at congested operations. It has surpassed Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Random Allocation with regards to SU throughput (up to 7.2 Mbps) and energy efficiency (up to 134.3 Kbps/mW). GWO-PowerGuard proved fast convergence rate of between 28-42 iterations, regardless of network scale. The outcomes indicate that the proposed framework is indeed effective to give an interference-aware, energy efficient and scalable solution to CR-WSNs."

    "abstract": "The core of the Transformer technique lies in the structure called self-attention. This self-attention technique is a new mechanism that differentiates the Transformer from conventional neural network structures, and it has played a good role in the excellent practical performance. Existing studies interpret the operating principle of the transformer as a nonlinear transport equation that reflects the structure of the interacting particle system. Meanwhile, since the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is defined with the entropy, it plays a important role in the information transmission fields. In existing studies, it has been elucidated that the optimal transportation problem (OTP) can be related to the variational problem of finding the optimal channel for the optimal rate distortion and information transmission. This paper applies these existing research results to the self-attention mechanism, and analyzes the upper and lower bounds of the gradient flow of the KL divergence, which is closely related to it. In addition, we examine the difference between the lower and upper gradient flow bounds of the change in Weighted mean Softmax according to the inverse temperature in self-attention through a simple toy example. The difference between the boundaries values of Weighted mean Softmax is relatively small, so this will be sufficient to examine only the upper bound. This result is expected to be of good help in understanding and interpreting the self-attention mechanism, which is the core scheme of Transformers."

However, the computational cost and the number of parameters caused by large-kernel convolution grow quadratically with kernel size, hindering its practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose a novel cross-linear layer. Compared to standard large-kernel convolution, the cross-linear layer utilizes fewer parameters while efficiently creating feature connections in the spatial domain. In addition, we introduce a secondary propagation strategy to further enhance the cross-linear layer. This strategy can further extend connections among local features over a wide range, leading to the development of a Double Cross Block (DCB). The DCB combines the cross-linear layer and the secondary propagation strategy to efficiently construct local feature connections and significantly reduce computational cost. Furthermore, DCB improves network performance. We validate the effectiveness of the DCB module through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and demonstrate its applicability to state-of-the-art (SOTA) network models. The results indicate that the DCB can serve as an efficient alternative to large-kernel convolution layers with fewer parameters and lower computational complexity."

This article introduces the Hybrid Clustering Algorithm and Linear Predictive Coding for Cross-Tier Security Integrated Wireless Body Area Network (HCLPCS) model to address these issues using hybrid clustering, lightweight data compression, and strong security measures. The HCLPCS model uses K-Means and K-Medoids clustering for efficient energy use and balanced node grouping, considering transmission distance and energy levels. To reduce data transmission, the Linear Predictive Coding Model (LPCM) predicts sensor readings, sending only the errors, which are compressed using RLE. This approach significantly decreases the amount of data sent, saving energy and reducing costs. The HCLPCS model includes a three-tier Cross-Tier Security Framework that ensures data integrity and confidentiality across sensor, gateway, and hospital network layers, featuring encryption, anomaly detection, and secure routing. Simulations conducted on the NS3 platform compared the HCLPCS model to existing protocols ECASS, LPRAK, and DATMS. Results showed that HCLPCS scales well, enhancing network lifespan and stability while keeping low delays and costs. It reduces energy usage by 30-50% and maintains low latency and high throughput in traffic. Overall, HCLPCS offers a scalable, secure, and energy-efficient solution for WBANs in healthcare."

The results demonstrate a significant LFC performance improvement compared to without using the optimization algorithms. JSO and WOA managed to reduce the settling time of the LFC response by more than 90% compared to the unoptimized system and more than 60% compared to Ziegler-Nichols tuning. The overshoot was reduced by 84.0% and the integral time absolute error (ITAE) was decreased by 98.1% compared to the unoptimized system. Thus, this demonstrates that JSO and WOA managed to improve the performance of LFC for two-area power system significantly by tuning the PID controller parameters."

    "abstract": "Graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms have demonstrated superior performance in achieving high query throughput with high recall rates. The graph-based index construction is computationally intensive and time-consuming. The state-of-the-art parallel index construction algorithm ParlayDiskANN that produces the highest quality index utilizes multi-threading parallelism to reduce the construction time. However, the computational capacity of a single node limits its performance improvement. To address this challenge, we propose a distributed graph-based ANNS index construction algorithm DGANN that extends multithreaded index construction of ParlayDiskANN to the distributed environment via task parallelism. DGANN employs a broadcasting-based variant of the BSP framework. Each node maintains a copy of the complete graph index, builds the index in parallel via incremental adjacency list broadcasting, and generates the identical index structure to ParlayDiskANN. We introduce a conflict-free parallel buffer organization mechanism for the adjacency list broadcasting to reduce lock overhead during communication. The experimental evaluation on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrates that DGANN achieves <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$6.00 \\times$</tex> to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$7.08 \\times$</tex> speedup in index construction compared to ParlayDiskANN on eight nodes. The communication overhead of DGANN accounts for only 8.1 % of the total execution time, helping it gains near-linear data scalability and node scalability."

    "abstract": "The well-known Remote Microphone Technique (RMT) creates quiet zones at locations away from physical microphones, making it suitable for active noise control (ANC) in large-scale open environments. Conventional centralized RMT algorithms rely on a single processor for multi-point noise prediction and global control filter updates. However, the resulting high computational cost limits scalability in practical applications. Recently, distributed RMT approaches based on incremental strategies have been proposed, where each node in the acoustic device network performs local noise prediction and participates in global filter estimation, thereby distributing the computational load across the system. However, the serial communication mechanism inherent to incremental strategies increases vulnerability to link failures and leads to excessive communication latency, which may violate ANC causality constraints and degrade noise reduction performance. This paper proposes a distributed RMT scheme based on an augmented diffusion strategy. By leveraging neighborhood cooperation and parallel communication, the proposed method reduces computational complexity and significantly shortens communication latency. Simulation results and system complexity analyses demonstrate that it achieves consistent steady-state noise reduction performance with significantly lower computational and communication costs."

    "abstract": "The evolution of Radio Access Network (RAN) architecture towards 6th Generation (6G) network introduces Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven automation and open, disaggregated design, enabling dynamic and intelligent resource optimization. In alignment with real-world telecom deployments by operators such as Vodafone, the O-RAN architecture is increasingly adopted in industrial-scale networks to enable AI-powered intelligent RAN control. Traditional resource allocation schemes typically rely on fixed algorithms to assign Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs) to multiple users, often targeting a single performance metric and lacking adaptability to real-time network conditions. This paper investigates two deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based downlink PRB allocation algorithms, namely Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), within a 5G Open RAN (O-RAN)-compliant simulation. The system integrates the Open5GS core network with a Software Radio Systems Radio Access Network (srsRAN) stack, configured as a disaggregated gNodeB (gNB) architecture consisting of an O-RAN Distributed Unit (O-DU) and O-RAN Radio Unit (O-RU). The control plane is managed by the Edge RAN Intelligent Controller (EdgeRIC), and a multi-objective reward function combining throughput and Jain’s fairness index is formulated to jointly optimize spectral efficiency and equitable resource distribution. The performance of both DRL algorithms is evaluated against traditional baselines in the O-RAN environment. Results show that TD3 demonstrates faster convergence and outperforms both PPO and rule-based methods in terms of fairness, while PPO achieves higher overall throughput."

    "abstract": "Recent research has focused on an innovative planar ion diode [1] that aims to improve ion beam uniformity compared to traditional cylindrical diode designs [2], particularly for applications in material science. A power pulse of 1.6 MV and 800 kA peaking at 50 ns is used to drive a 2D particle-in-cell simulation of the diode. During this pulse, unexpected dynamic fluctuations were observed in the magnetic null region. These fluctuations are manifested as up-and-down variations in time where the electron beam current connects to the end of the anode. This behavior is surprising as it deviates from the symmetrical dynamics expected in planar diode configurations. Notably, these fluctuations are detected across various planar anode setups, including monolithic and dual anodes, as well as differing thicknesses, such as ultra-thin 100-micron anodes and significantly thicker 1600-micron anodes. Analysis indicates that the thinner anodes produce a broader ion energy spectrum than their thicker counterparts [1]. It is hypothesized that this peculiar fluctuating behavior may be linked to plasma instabilities, which may help explain the observed variations in ion energy distributions. This intriguing phenomenon raises questions about the underlying physics and highlights the complexity of plasma and particle dynamics in these high-energy-density environments. By deepening our understanding of these fluctuations, we can gain insights that could enhance the design and efficiency of diode systems for various applications. This presentation will explore these fluctuating behaviors and discuss their potential implications for advancing plasma and particle dynamics knowledge within pulsed power diodes."

Despite these advantages, SLMs often underperform compared to large language models (LLMs) in summarization tasks. In particular, they struggle to maintain coherence and ensure factual accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a feedback-guided frame-work for summarization. This framework improves summary quality without any fine-tuning of SLMs. To implement our method, we use ModernBERT, a bidirectional encoder designed for long-context inputs, which is fine-tuned to classify each article-summary pair into one of eight predefined feedback types. Next, the SLM uses the predicted feedback to perform a single, post-hoc refinement step. We evaluate this approach on the CNN/DailyMail news dataset and observe consistent improvements in both Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Score (BERTScore). In several cases, our method outperforms LLMs, despite requiring only minimal computing resources. Our results show that the modular, feedback-guided approach can deliver high-quality summaries on lightweight systems with minimal resource consumption."

This work introduces the in-house development of a dimension-reduced and modular, single-sensor reflectometer instrument, enabling precise measurement of individual layers within multi-layer coated samples. This work includes the development of a new hardware design integrating a microprocessor, a light source, a logic converter and a spectrometer sensor; additionally, a unique software platform was developed to perform near real-time multilayer coating thickness measurements. Seven electrodeposited samples were created for testing and validation purposes. The results of more than one hundred and thirty measurements per sample show that the thickness of an Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) layer ranged between 125.48 to 138.82 ± 2.87 nm, achieving less than 7% error compared to vendor specifications (specification: 130 nm). Additionally, the thickness measurements from the sensor revealed a linear response of the Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):Poly sodium 4-styrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) layer with increasing electrodeposition charge, resulting in thicknesses ranging from 201.47 to 506.03 ± 2.73 nm.

However, existing prototype-based FSL methods suffer from data distribution variations among randomly sampled tasks, leading to unstable class prototype representations and weak cross-task generalization with limited samples. To address this issue, we propose a momentum-enhanced dual-prototype learning (MEDPL) framework for robust few-shot HSI classification. Firstly, a momentum-updated prototype mechanism constructs an iteratively optimized prototype memory bank. It obtains accumulated prototypes by exponentially decaying weighted fusion of historical and current prototypes, significantly suppressing noise from randomly sampled data and class center shifts caused by distribution bias. Simultaneously, a class-conditioned perturbation-augmentation strategy is introduced. It generates adaptive noise perturbations for support set features based on learnable covariance matrices to obtain enhanced prototypes, thereby improving the generalization representation capability of class prototypes across tasks. Secondly, a dual-prototype metric learning framework is designed, jointly utilizing accumulated prototypes and enhanced prototypes to synergistically enhance the model’s classification stability and cross-task generalization, thus significantly improving the robustness of few-shot classification. Experimental results demonstrate that MEDPL outperforms other few-shot hyperspectral image classification methods. Our source code is available at https://github.com/hejinrong/MEDPL."

This coherent beam-wave interaction leading to electron bunching in phase space either azimuthally or axially. In TM modes operations, the axial electric field (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{E}_{\\mathrm{z}}$</tex>) may introduce bunching competition, potentially degrading output power. As a result, TM modes are traditionally considered unsuitable for gyrotron operation, and most analyses excludes TM modes from consideration. Recent theoretical studies on TM-mode gyrotrons have been devoted to studying the underlying mechanisms. Also, linear theory shows that the interaction of TM modes depends on the sign of the axial wavenumber (kz), unlike that of TE modes, and azimuthal bunching and axial bunching cooperate with each other when <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{kz}&lt;0$</tex>, indicating that TM modes favor the backward-wave interaction. On the other hand, nonlinear analysis revealed that properly tapering structure can enhance the efficiency, but the impact on start-oscillation current still not be fully investigated. The study compares the tapered effect on TE and TM mode gyrotron under normalized cavity length and magnetic field and using axis-encircling electron beams due to comparable mode-coupling strengths. Through a comparative examination of downtaper and uptaper structures, we observed distinct differences in the starting current between TE and TM modes. The results indicate that TM mode are more favorable for backward interaction. This research provides new insights into optimizing gyrotron performance by tailoring the taper profile, which could improve efficiency and operational flexibility."

    "abstract": "Magnetic field structures are of interest in many high energy density plasmas, such as investigation of Magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities in z-pinches or magnetized plasma flows relevant to lab astrophysics. As linearly polarized light passes through a plasma, it undergoes a polarization rotation due to the Faraday effect depending on the path length, magnetic field strength, and electron density. This effect can be exploited in order to obtain 2D images of magnetic field distribution in a plasma given the electron density, which can be obtained through laser interferometry. The Faraday diagnostic system uses a two-detector scheme to eliminate the effects of plasma self-emission and other artifacts. To retrieve accurate magnetic field information, the two obtained polarograms must be correlated to each other. Overcoming differences in detector and optics positioning is important when resolving small spatial-scale magnetic field effects, such as those in shock regions occurring in magnetically accelerated flows. Multiple image correlation methods are employed in the reconstruction of magnetic fields, including a fourier-based phase correlation and homography computed from a corner detection algorithm run on images taken of a fiducial grid. Work towards developing an automated routine improving accuracy in magnetic field retrieval from polarograms is presented."

    "abstract": "Rotated object detection plays a crucial role in various visual perception tasks such as aerial photography, remote sensing imagery, and low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery. However, targets in both high-altitude remote sensing images and low-altitude UAV images often exhibit significant scale variations, diverse orientations, and dense spatial distributions, posing formidable challenges to detection algorithms in terms of accuracy and real-time performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Global-Local Adaptive Network for Efficient Rotated Object Detection (GLANet), designed to enhance detection precision and efficiency in complex scenarios. GLANet incorporates a lightweight backbone network, Revisiting Mobile CNN From ViT Perspective (RepViT), which balances inference efficiency with an improved capability to represent directional structural features of objects. During feature fusion, we introduce the Geometry-Enhanced Attention guided Rotated Feature Pyramid Network (GEAR-FPN), which jointly models global semantic context and local detailed features, thereby strengthening detection performance for small-scale and densely packed targets. In the detection head, we present a Dynamic Lightweight Geometric-Aware Head (DLGA-Head) alongside a Dynamic Lightweight Global Attention (Dynamic LWGA) mechanism to strengthen the representation of target orientation and boundary information. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on both the DOTA and CODrone datasets. GLANet achieves an mAP of 78.12% on DOTA with competitive, near-state-of-the-art accuracy and significantly higher computational efficiency than other top-performing models. Specifically, it contains only 8.64M parameters and 35.69 GFLOPs, ensuring real-time inference while maintaining high precision. On the CODrone dataset, it further delivers improved detection performance while maintaining superior efficiency compared with existing approaches."

The bandpass response is achieved by evolving the circuit structure. An on-chip prototype with a 3-dB fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 32.7% (4-4.5 GHz) is fabricated for verification purposes. In addition, a novel ultra-wideband bandpass filter (BPF) with a measured 3-dB FBW of 83.7% (4.5-9 GHz) is further designed by introducing a three-dimensional (3D) inductor, which provides a reliable solution for expanding the applications of on-chip transformer."

    "abstract": "Collisions within the sheath are well known to have the effect of reducing ion energy at the electrode. For this reason, low-pressure conditions have been preferred in semiconductor processing to maintain ion directionality and preserve energy within the sheath. However, this study reports that collisions within the sheath can, in fact, lead to an increase in ion energy at the electrode. To demonstrate this, ion trajectory simulations were introduced, and the ion energy distribution and mean energy were examined as a function of pressure. Additionally, ion trajectories were analyzed to interpret the observed results. The findtings revealed that collisions within the sheath alter ion trajectories, causing relatively low-energy ions to transition into highenergy states. This study provides new insights into semiconductor processing, where low-pressure conditions have trajditionally been favored for ion energy preservation, and contributes to a deeper understanding of ion dynamics within the sheath."

While no accelerator based on the PWFA concept has yet been built to serve actual user applications, the experimental results already allow to identify viable use cases for beam-driven plasma wakefield acceleration and to support conceptual designs of future accelerator facilities, as it is e.g. being done in the so-called HALHF study for a future linear collider.

These transmission lines may require multiple insulator media, and the separation of these differing dielectrics by a solid barrier causes permittivity mismatches and field enhancements along the interface. Understanding how the enhancements impact transmission line performance and its ability to resist catastrophic flashover events along the barrier surface is critical. We have designed and fabricated a small replica of the water-insulated intermediate storage capacitor from Sandia National Laboratory's Z facility to study dielectric surface flashover across a polyurethane barrier separating oil-insulated and water-insulated transmission line sections. Multiple transmission line designs, with and without windows, are fielded to facilitate observation of the surface flashover phenomena in the region of interest, while a roughly 600 kV Marx generator is used to drive the experiment. The motivation for the experiments, details of the experimental setup, and results obtained to date will be presented."

However, these systems face critical safety vulnerabilities from physical adversarial attacks, such as road marking manipulations and object-blending perturbations. This work introduces an adversarial-aware Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (AdvFMEA) framework that quantifies these risks through an Adversarially Aware Risk Priority Number (AA-RPN) integrating factors such as attack persistence, depth-error severity, and adversarial impact. Benchmarking seven state-of-the-art models across CARLA simulations and the real-world KITTI dataset reveals that transformer architectures suffer from systemic depth spoofing. At the same time, lightweight CNNs exhibit higher safety-critical error rates. Our fail-operational approach includes an attack-agnostic FMEA methodology compliant with ISO 21448 (SOTIF), empirical validation of sim-to-real threat correlation, and deployable safety thresholds for resource-constrained systems."

Microstrip lines are used to excite the patch and the connected slot. The CSPAA is designed on a seven-layer vertical stack-up, making it suitable for on-package scenarios. The fabricated CSPAA has a measured bandwidth of 21.07% (centered at 28 GHz) and a measured realized gain of 9.51 dBi at broadside, yielding a total efficiency of 83%. The CSPAA demonstrates wide beamsteering capabilities up to ±390 with a compact form factor of 0.0881λ3 (1.52λ x 0.58λ x 0.1λ), where λ is the free-space wavelength at 28 GHz. A comprehensive comparison of the proposed CSPAA with the state-of-the-art shows that the proposed prototype has excellent bandwidth, gain, wide beamsteering capabilities, and a smaller form factor compared to previous solutions for mmWave on-package applications."

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various graph-structured datasets and applications. However, their message-passing mechanisms primarily capture local information, limiting their ability to model long-range dependencies. While existing approaches enhance aggregation methods to incorporate local neighbor features, expanding the receptive field in globally aware GNNs increases model complexity, complicating the training of highcomplexity architectures. Community information, which uncovers the intrinsic graph structure, can address these limitations. To this end, we propose a Community-Aware Graph Neural Network (CAG) framework that leverages contrastive learning to enhance global feature extraction through community-aware modeling. To handle challenges such as heterogeneous community sizes and noise, CAG employs a Community Subgraph Explorer guided by Monte Carlo tree search, which identifies dense subgraphs as representative structures to mitigate noise. Extensive experiments show that CAG substantially improves GNN performance in node classification, outperforming backbone models with stateof-the-art accuracy gains (+4.09% by CAG (GCN) on CiteSeer) while maintaining acceptable computational overhead compared to backbone models. Our findings underscore the efficacy of community-aware frameworks in enhancing global information aggregation in traditional GNNs."

Therefore, firstly, the framework for failure mode recognition method is constructed. Secondly, the steps of decomposing and identifying weak links are introduced from the aspects of designing functional and manufacturing physical realization, by using an improved risk fuzzy matrix and integrating expert evaluations of failure modes and the importance of each risk factor, the main failure modes of the product are quantitatively identified. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified using a typical RF module as an example, and quality improvement suggestions were proposed, providing scientific input for designers to implement module quality improvement."

The proposed control laws are validated through phase portraits and simulated in Simulink, supported by the PX4 package to create a high-fidelity quadrotor simulation model. The validation results show that the designed control laws successfully achieve the intended objectives and may exhibit global asymptotic stability. Furthermore, the simulation demonstrates consistent performance, with the quadrotor able to track the setpoint without violating the FOV boundaries. The results confirm that, within the FOV, the system consistently converges to the equilibrium point for various setpoint and FOV combinations."

The bot is intended to be deployed within tactical, or even shipboard systems, and it would empower autonomous, in-the-moment recommendations of medications for specific symptoms, while mitigating the risks associated with deploying personnel self-medicating through potential non-fundamental use errors. For this work, we employed Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the system, and the bot was trained on a specific dataset derived from material on pharmacological sources, contextualized for medical practices in the Philippines. Based on evaluation the model achieved an average F1-score of 0.7296, which is above the 0.60-0.70 expected levels of performance for medical dialogue systems. The research shows promise for the model as it enhances combat and maritime healthcare readiness by providing consistent, low-bandwidth, and local medical assistance when connected medical supervision may not be immediately available."

Traditional SAR despeckling techniques often suffer from the trade-offs between computational cost, edge preservation, and adaptability to complex scene structures. To address these limitations, the proposed method introduces three improvements: (1) A logdomain distance metric derived from a transformed Bayesian likelihood is proposed. It linearizes the multiplicative noise model and allows fast and stable patch similarity computation. (2) A Wiener-based prior estimation that leverages local statistics to provide a more accurate reflectance prior is adopted. It reduces the estimation bias and enhancing structure preservation. (3) A sketch-based anisotropic weighting mechanism that integrates geometric priors based on gradient orientation and edge strength is proposed. It enables edge-aware aggregation and superior texture retention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of both the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and the structural similarity index (SSIM), while also achieving substantial computational efficiency and improving the visual quality."

    "abstract": "Conversational text-to-speech (TTS) generates context-appropriate expressive speech by modeling dialogue context, without requiring manual paralinguistic labels such as emotion or intent. However, acoustically similar emotions (e.g., happy vs. angry) often cause inappropriate renderings. To address this, we propose a preference-based optimization approach that reinforces the model toward selecting contextually appropriate emotional expressions. Specifically, we adopt direct preference optimization (DPO) in a unit-based TTS architecture, enabling fine-grained supervision of emotional expression by comparing discrete unit sequences for more and less suitable speech samples. Our method employs a text-to-unit model predicting discrete acoustic units from phonemes and context, followed by a unit-based HiFi-GAN vocoder. Training proceeds in two stages: first, the text-to-unit model is optimized with cross-entropy (CE) loss on ground-truth units; second, DPO is applied using unit pairs reflecting appropriate versus inappropriate emotions within the same context. Experiments on the STUDIES dataset show that preference-based optimization substantially improves emotion recognition accuracy (67.14 % with CE+DPO vs. 48.45 % with CE only). These results demonstrate that our approach enables fine-grained control of emotional expression and better captures subtle distinctions in conversational speech."

DI can help to improve the downstream speech related tasks even when speakers have a strong dialect.

Recent studies have explored fine-tuning pre-trained speech models for tasks like DI using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, which offer parameter efficiency but limited improvement in memory efficiency and training speed. To address these challenges, we explore Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning (MEFT) methods, originally proposed for language processing, and apply them to the generalpurpose pre-trained speech model. We then comprehensively analyze the GPU memory usage and fine-tuning speed based on various MEFT methods. As a case study, we fine-tune the Whisper model to identify six Mandarin subdialects from the KeSpeech dataset, reducing GPU memory usage by up to 73.25% and accelerating training speed by a factor of 2.1, while maintaining accuracy comparable to vanilla fine-tuning and PEFT methods."

The availability of ultrasound imaging, which is non-invasive, as a viable tool has been made possible by the portability, affordability and safety of the tools. The paper presents DCCP (Deep Convolutional Classification Principle) - a new model of multi-class classification of respiratory conditions based on ultrasound images. The model uses the Kaggle Dataset known as Lungs Disease Dataset (4 types) which includes more than 10,000 augmented images of five classes namely COVID-19, Bacterial Pneumonia, Viral Pneumonia, TB, and Normal. Pre-processing of the images consists of application of grayscale normalization, speckle noise removal along with artefact removal methods CLAHE and median filtering. Compact and effective CNN backbone EfficientNet-B0 is used to extract deep spatial features. It is concatenated with Convolutional Block Attention Modules (CBAM) and a multi-scale feature fusion to prioritise the pathological patterns (e.g, pleural irregularities and B-lines). The global average pooling followed by dense layers and softmax activation form the classification head of the model to give prognostic predictions in five classes. The model has been trained on Adam optimizer and Cross-entropy loss and shows an overall accuracy of 98.1%. The highest F1-score of 0.997 is achieved on dogs and highest F1-scores of all other classes improve to 0.92 and above. Its performance is confirmed by such evaluation measures as ROC-AUC, precision, recall, and confusion matrix. This paper shows the feasibility of DCCP to have a lightweight, interpretable, and deployable model that seeks to screen respiratory diseases at the point of care via lung ultrasound images in real-time."

A conventional approach for defending against PA and CLPA is to remove the poisoned samples from a dataset before training. However, this prophylactic defense approach is difficult to implement in federated learning (FL) environments because training samples dispersedly owned by multiple clients are not shared in a single place in FL. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel therapeutic defense approach: a “detoxification” method for recovering the performance of a “poisoned” model that has suffered CLPA. To achieve detoxification, the proposed method fine-tunes only the network head of a poisoned model using a small set of labeled clean samples and a large set of unlabeled out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Poisoned models tend to output uneven confidence scores near the ideal decision boundary, which is undesirable and therefore is calibrated by the proposed method using OOD samples with almost uniform soft labels. In the results of our experiments conducted on an object image recognition model, its recognition accuracy was recovered by up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{1 1. 9 8} \\%$</tex> compared to the original poisoned model. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Message-locked encryption is often employed in cloud storage systems to maintain both security and storage efficiency. A key server, operating within a trusted execution environment such as Intel SGX, can mitigate the risks of bruteforce attacks and compromise issues associated with the key server in a given storage system. However, due to the potential risk for single-point failure, the reliability of the key server cannot be guaranteed. Moreover, the key server may become a performance bottleneck for the entire system. To address these issues, we designed and implemented a distributed key server system named DistributedSGXDedup, which operates within a trusted execution environment based on SGX. The reliability of the system is enhanced as multiple key servers remain operational. Specifically, our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that the performance of key generation increases with the number of key servers. We also present a security analysis that shows the security of DistributedSGXDedup is maintained by conducting key operations within trusted execution environments."

    "abstract": "Dubbing—translating and synchronizing spoken content across languages—requires not only semantic accuracy but also precise alignment with the timing and rhythm of the original speech. While recent work has explored paraphrasing with large language models (LLMs) for dubbing, most approaches rely on a single translation and a one-shot paraphrasing pass, limiting the space of alternatives and often resulting in suboptimal alignment. We propose a multi-candidate framework that leverages N-best machine translation outputs and in-context paraphrasing with LLMs to generate diverse candidates that preserve meaning while varying in structure and length. This expanded candidate space enables better exploration of alignment options without modifying the underlying MT or TTS systems. To select the best output, we introduce synchrony-aware reranking based on speech-only alignment metrics—specifically Speech Length Compliance and Speech Overlap—which quantify temporal alignment between the generated and reference speech without requiring video input or retraining. Experiments on German-to-English dubbing using the FLEURS dataset and the IWSLT 2024 Dubbing Challenge test set show that our approach improves temporal synchrony and perceived naturalness. These results highlight the value of combining translation diversity, incontext paraphrasing, and synchrony-based selection for highquality automatic dubbing."

    "abstract": "The use of cosmetics as facial makeup to conceal black spots, skin discoloration, pores, and wrinkles has become increasingly popular among the general public and public figures. This trend has driven up demand for skincare products, particularly cosmetics, and research to measure their effectiveness. One area of research focuses on evaluating the wrinkle-concealing capabilities of cosmetic products. In this paper, we only focus on developing an algorithm to detect changes in dynamic wrinkles caused by facial expressions. Soon, this method can be used to assess the effectiveness of wrinkle concealment cosmetics across different facial expressions. In this study, a video capture configuration was designed to make dynamic wrinkles on facial images visible and significant. An algorithm was developed for segmenting and extracting facial wrinkle features to facilitate measuring the efficacy of skincare products. The method used includes comparing the Structure Tensor and the Sobel filter, with entropy used as wrinkle feature extraction. High entropy values indicate greater disorder, reflecting higher levels of secondary facial wrinkles. The results show that the Structure Tensor method has high sensitivity to variations in facial structure and orientation, while the Sobel method focuses more on edge detection but is less responsive to complex texture variations. Additionally, entropy values for the Structure Tensor method are significantly higher (0.6345 to 0.6877) compared to Sobel (0.0032 to 0.0398). Therefore, it can be concluded that the Structure Tensor method is more effective as a tool for measuring skin wrinkle levels due to its higher value variation in facial structure and orientation."

Addressing this issue, this paper proposes a feature fusion machine learning model based on the CNN-LSTM-Attention-FC architecture. The model fuses Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and low-frequency electrochemical noise (LF-ECN) features to achieve high-precision prediction of the battery SOH. The results demonstrate that the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the fused feature model is 0.01376, which is over 70 % performance improvement over the single feature model. It verifies the effectiveness of the feature fusion strategy. Utilizing the CNN-LSTM-Attention-FC architecture for feature fusion effectively captures the hidden key features in the fused data, significantly improves the prediction capability of the fusion model, and provides a reliable technical solution for SOH prediction of lithium-ion batteries."

While most algorithms and approaches perform favorably on contemporary popular instrumental music, precise vocal onset detection remains an elusive challenge, especially when expanded to include genres outside the typical applications. In particular, onset detection of medieval choral music faces further obstacles due to melismatic passages, variable expressing timing, fast-time and slow-time pitch variations, and an abstract notational system. To overcome these challenges, this work proposes a jumping dynamic time warping classifier to segment recorded audio frames to their respective plainchant neume. The approach uses an iterative maximum a posteriori pitch estimate to dynamically adjust neume pitch class from the initial scored values. The proposed algorithm shows significant improvements in vocal onset detection compared to standard and state-of-the-art audio-only and audio-alignment approaches."

Additionally, we propose a human-perception-based CLAP called Human-CLAP by training a contrastive language-audio model using the subjective evaluation score. In our experiments, the results indicate that our Human-CLAP improved the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) between the CLAPScore and the subjective evaluation scores by more than 0.17 compared with the conventional CLAP."

Therefore, this paper explores the feasible technical solutions for direct grid-connected HTSSCs. By comparing the advantages and disadvantages of stators with different air-core armature structures in high-voltage applications, the stator with ring-type air-core armature is selected as the design basis. The insulation system and cooling system of the 35kV high-voltage stator are comprehensively designed. The insulation reliability and anticorona ability of the high-voltage stator are verified through electric field simulation. At the same time, the cooling effect of the air-cooling system on the armature winding and the stator core is verified through temperature field simulation. The results show that the special insulation system of the stator with ring-type air-core armature can achieve an armature current density of 3.5A/mm2, which is higher than that of the traditional synchronous condenser of the same power level. Therefore, the stator with ring-type air-core armature has the potential for high-voltage applications and can support the direct grid-connected operation of the HTSSC."

As an application, we also present a framework in which the proposed directional filtering is applied to sound fields estimated using microphone array measurements.

The study proposes a physics-guided fault diagnosis method for analog circuits using an ODE-GRU model, which integrates the continuous dynamic description of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with the temporal modeling capability of gated recurrent units (GRUs). A SallenKey circuit was simulated in LTspice, and representative timedomain fault data were generated via systematic fault injection and Monte Carlo analysis. The proposed method accurately captures dynamic anomalies caused by parameter drift in sensitive components, achieving a diagnostic accuracy of 90.44% a 17.55% improvement over conventional GRU models. The embedded physical constraints enhance interpretability and robustness, particularly under noise and nonlinear interference. Experimental results demonstrate that the ODE-GRU model effectively distinguishes between fault types, offering a reliable, data-efficient, and generalizable approach for circuit fault detection."

A mesh of sensors captures critical variables: soil moisture, temperature, humidity, pH, and light intensity. Supplementary biosensors, combined with image recognition, identify pest presence and early signs of plant distress. Data from these sensors is relayed to a microcontroller that runs adaptive algorithms, activating the irrigation and pest control mechanisms whenever measurements exceed established limits. Farmers interact with the system through a dedicated mobile app, accessing real-time readings, adjusting thresholds, and controlling devices over a Wi-Fi link, thereby permitting remote supervision. Prior to analysis, readings undergo normalization and feature extraction, which refine the input for subsequent predictive tasks. Ensemble learning classifiers are then deployed to enhance the accuracy of pest forecasting and resource allocation decisions. Trials in farmers’ fields reveal notable reductions in irrigation volumes, diminished crop damage from insect infestations, and decreased reliance on manual labour. The outcome is a modular, resource-efficient, and intelligent framework that aligns with the principles of sustainable modern agriculture."

Most existing robustness methods focus on the acoustic side-using enhancement techniques, noise-aware training, or specialized architectures-but often struggle to generalize across diverse conditions, especially when background noise includes non-target human speech. In this work, we focus on ASR robustness against a range of irrelevant inputs that commonly occur in daily life-namely, stationary noise, background music with vocals, and human utterances not belonging to the target speaker. Crucially, when noise takes the form of intelligible speech, it introduces linguistic interference that purely acoustic methods may fail to suppress. This motivates our investigation of a novel, language-level approach: leveraging textual in-context learning with large language models (LLMs) to guide ASR output through prompting. Experiment results demonstrate that this strategy enhances robustness without requiring retraining or front-end modification, providing a flexible and scalable alternative to conventional acoustic-centric methods."

    "abstract": "Although commercial networks such as LTE and 5G have seen significant improvements, they sometimes face challenges in providing reliable, low-latency links between high-altitude platforms, such as autonomous drones, and remote servers as they are primarily designed for terrestrial use. As a result, on-drone object detection becomes necessary, but the limited computational capacity of typical mission computers makes real-time inference infeasible. Moreover, the inference latency of state-of-the-art deep-learning detectors is determined solely by the input resolution, irrespective of scene content; this produces severe inefficiencies when targets occupy only a small portion of each drone-captured image frame. To address these challenges, this paper presents image-rearrangement techniques that automatically extract RoIs from each frame and re-tiles them into a compact, high-density layout so as to reduce overall computation. With our evaluation on a drone-captured image dataset, we achieve substantial speedups up to 4.86x while maintaining detection accuracy."

First, we focus on the collection, selection, and cleaning of multi-source heterogeneous data to construct a multisource, multi-modal dataset that includes reports from multiple perspectives. The dataset offers a comprehensive view of each event. Secondly, by utilizing the visual transformer instead of the traditional CNN as the visual feature extractor, we unify the processing of text and image inputs into a convolution-free process. At the same time, the text semantic perception module and the visual semantic perception module are designed to fuse news text and images from multiple sources. Fiimage inputs into anally, the bidirectional attention mechanism is used to enhance image-text correlation features, adjusting and optimizing the representation of one modality based on the content of the other. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate that the model we proposed can provide an effective solution for fake news detection in the era of big data."

    "abstract": "Data migration during cluster scaling is a critical challenge in distributed file systems, causing high I/O overhead and performance degradation. Typical data distribution algorithms, such as consistent hashing, can reduce data movement when new nodes are added. However, they still require relocating a substantial portion of data, which limits scalability and elasticity. This paper proposes ZMDFS, a novel distributed file system that leverages hashing-based method for data placement while achieving zero-migration during cluster expansion. To eliminate data movement, ZMDFS introduces a group-based partitioning strategy that divides existing and newly added nodes into independent, fixed-membership subclusters, ensuring data distribution stability and avoiding costly rebalancing. A multi-objective optimization approach is designed to intelligently select groups for data placement, based on the goals of data balancing, load balancing, and throughput maximization. After that, to place one data in the group, a list of node hash values is generated using Jenkins hashing, based on node IDs and the data path, while considering temporarily failed or offline nodes. During data distribution, ZMDFS prioritizes available nodes from the hash list, thereby avoiding data movement caused by temporary node failures or offline events within every group. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that ZMDFS reduces data migration and rebalancing time by over <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{9 6 \\%}$</tex> compared to GlusterFS, significantly enhancing scalability and system performance during dynamic cluster scaling."

The multi-robotic partial disassembly line represents a technological advancement over traditional manual disassembly lines. Line balancing optimization can enhance both the efficiency and stability of the disassembly process. To address the partial disassembly line balancing problem with multirobotic stations (PDLB-MRS), a mixed-integer programming model (MIPM) considering robotic efficiency differences is formulated to minimize cycle time, energy consumption, and hazard index while determining their global optimal values. Furthermore, an improved NSGA-II algorithm (INSGA-II) is developed to efficiently optimize the PDLB-MRS. Finally, MIPM and INSGA-II are applied to a real-world mixed disassembly case involving two types of computers. The comparative results obtained using GUROBI and INSGA-II validate the accuracy of the model and demonstrate the superior performance of the algorithm. Moreover, the derived Pareto solution set offers multiple decision-making options."

A UML Profile for Node.js, supporting both SQL and NoSQL databases, is introduced for building design models of web applications. Transformation engines are provided for model-to-code (M2C) and code-to-model (C2M) transformation. The proposed approach was evaluated through three case studies. The forward engineering results demonstrated high model-to-code transformation rates especially for Model (86.18-94.53%) and Route (70.73-90.52%), with consistent performance across SQL (MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) implementations. The reverse engineering results showed 100% correctness in code-to-model transformation for different implementations of backend code.

Therefore, it is needed to reconfigure educational paradigms to educate engineers to be equipped with advanced creativity, transdisciplinary problem-solving, and foundational technical acumen. In this study, a framework was developed, leveraging design-driven engineering innovation platforms, such as structured design fairs, to embed Industry 5.0 principles into undergraduate and early-career engineering curricula. Anchored in cyber-physical frameworks integration, digital twin modeling, and human-machine collaborative intelligence, the framework operationalizes experiential learning cycles to promote ideation, rapid prototyping, and frameworkic validation under real-world constraints. The framework is grounded in established engineering epistemologies, incorporating Bloom’s revised taxonomy for cognitive development, TRIZ-based methodologies for creative problem-solving, and ABET-aligned frameworks for assessing technical competencies. Empirical validation of the framework was conducted through multi-site intervention studies involving 320 engineering students. Metrics were used to assess computational thinking, embedded frameworks design, sustainability heuristics, and collaborative intelligence in pre- and post-intervention. The results indicated significant improvements in students’ abilities to decompose complex problems, demonstrate proficiency in digital fabrication, and apply frameworks engineering principles effectively. The results also presented the potential of innovation-driven educational interventions for advancing Industry 5.0 readiness. Such interventions help to solve the cognitive and technical divide between academic instruction and industrial application. The developed framework integrates ethical, innovative, and human-centric competencies into the curricula, enhancing educational outcomes to meet industrial demands."

First, instead of a single “mega-agent,” a set of specialized micro-agents was employed for stance detection, named entity recognition, contradiction detection, ontology enrichment, and report generation. Second, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Graphs (GraphRAG) layer, which manages knowledge graph triples alongside vector embeddings, has been incorporated to eliminate separate graph and vector stores and to shorten the query path. Third, a probabilistic Bloom filter that performs URL refresh operations with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathcal{O}(1)$</tex> complexity and without generating false negatives has replaced key-value- based caches, resulting in a significant reduction in memory usage. A prototype evaluation was conducted using three datasets containing 1 million, 2 million, and 3 million URLs. The use of the Bloom filter increased the in-memory URL query speed by 10000% during runtime. The updated ATAM sessions confirmed that the previously identified risk and trade-off scenarios are no longer considered risks, thus validating that the proposed improvements significantly enhanced the system's functional suitability, performance, and resource utilization attributes.

The method offers fast and many subsequent growth cycles that are independent from environmental factors. However, different challenges need to be addressed. Foremost important is a clean production that prevents the spread of pathogens. Ideally no synthetic agrochemicals, such as in particular plant protection agents but also fertilizers, are required. Economic constraints demand an efficient use of resources, i.e., by recirculating water. The decontamination and disinfection, especially of water, are predestined for plasma technologies. Without any other consumables but electrical power, plasma offers an environmentally benign, sustainable and controllable solution. In addition, plasma treated water can provide nitrogen as fertilizer and plasma treatments of seeds offer an alternative for seed hygiene and even the stimulation of germination and plant growth [1], [2]. Accordingly, we investigated plasma technologies in a vertical farming system of the 4th generation, which allows the complete environmental control of growth conditions for economically relevant conditions for 600 plants, i.e., Basil. Scale and scope are distinct advantages in comparison to so far mostly conducted laboratory experiments. A recirculating water system was integrated with the possibility to investigate different plasma treatment concepts concerning maintenance of system hygiene and to replace the need for additional nitrogen fertilizers. The results for a growth period of 4-6 weeks demonstrate the successful replacement of nitrogen fertilizers and efficient reduction of microbial loads and their associated impact on plant health. Different operating principles were considered with respect to economic constraints and advantages, such as water savings."

Using the CoACD algorithm for efficient preprocessing of complex obstacle environments, it generates feasible operational domains considering upper - limb joint constraints and inverse kinematics. The GJK algorithm handles collision penalties, and the RULA scoring system manages posture penalties. A normalized operator then provides a quantitative evaluation of the operating space.

At the same time, nonlinear phenomena in dense charged systems (Coulomb systems and plasma) caused by a quadratic reaction to an electromagnetic field, for example, second harmonic generation (SHG), parametric radiation generation (PGR), have not been studied. To avoid this drawback, we investigate SHG and PGR in dense plasma. SHG and PGR can be implemented in laboratory conditions in the presence of stationary relatively strong magnetic fields. The calculated characteristics of these phenomena are determined by the quadratic response function (QRF) of a charged substance in a constant magnetic field to an electromagnetic field. Research shows that a consistent analytical calculation of exact formal expressions for QRF (obtained within the framework of the theory of nonlinear response) of non-ideal charged media is impossible. Computer modeling of exact expressions for QRF has not been carried out even for model non-ideal Coulomb systems. Therefore, it is recommended to use a model approach to determine these functions. We propose a variant of the model: using an explicit approximation for the response function with appropriate parameters based on the exact frequency moments of the QRF and the corresponding correlators. For this purpose, a quadratic fluctuation-dissipation theorem is formulated and the frequency moments of triple correlators and QRF to the electromagnetic field (EF) of dense charged media in a permanent magnetic field are calculated, which are the basis of the proposed model. In accordance with this model, the structure of QRF to an electromagnetic field of a non-ideal laboratory electron-ion hydrogen plasma in a constant magnetic field and the corresponding characteristics of SHG and PGR are investigated."

Snow-covered ground is modeled as a three-layer medium, and the reflection behavior is examined under vertical and horizontal polarization conditions. Using the Friis equation at 2.4 GHz, the impact of reflection-induced interference on received power is evaluated. Results show that horizontal polarization experiences greater interference due to phase reversal, while vertical polarization provides more stable performance. The findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate polarization for reliable LOS communication in snow-laden environments."

    "abstract": "Quantum machine learning is an emerging Technology that is evolving rapidly and aims to translate classical machine learning models into a quantum context to be extended with the properties and applications of quantum mechanics. Despite the obvious advantage of being able to process large amounts of data in a short time, this integration between quantum and machine learning is not without challenges, especially when it comes to real datasets. In this paper, we aim to analyze the practical applicability of quantum machine learning approaches and to perform different experiments on generated and dedicated datasets that respect the quantum kernel training pattern, respectively, on real datasets, and to determine whether these can be processed to be suitable for quantum operations. To fully see the performance and potential advantage brought by the quantum component, a series of tests will be performed on both simulators and real hardware and it remains to be seen whether there is an improvement related to time complexity. Another goal based on the experiments carried out is to see on which types of datasets it is worth or justifiable to use quantum hardware at the expense of classical one. The novelty of this work lies in the use of a real-world dataset, and the experiments demonstrate that integrating quantum methods with classical processing yields higher accuracy compared to purely classical approaches."

Linear regression and support vector regression (SVR) models were employed to test the hypothesis. The results showed that the competitions play a vital role in developing students' capabilities and practical skills, although their influence on students' postgraduate admission rates is modest.

Although researchers have made significant progress in recent years, two key challenges remain: (1) ensuring temporal consistency in the reconstructed results, and (2) achieving accurate reconstruction under uncertainty in the input data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) for modeling sequential dependencies and ensuring temporal consistency, alongside a diffusion-based module that generates pseudo-3D structures to provide teacher supervision. This diffusion-based supervision enhances spatial accuracy, particularly under weakly supervised conditions. Extensive experiments on the Human3.6M dataset show that our approach achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to existing baselines."

This study examines the effectiveness of quantile-based data binning on classical machine learning algorithms in predicting resource yields pertinent to military applications. Furthermore, the effectiveness of Backpropagation Artificial Neural Networks (BP-ANN) and Naive Bayes classifiers with regression models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression, and Multi-Layer Perceptron Regressors (MLPRegressor) are compared using a robust dataset representative of global resource metrics. The results indicate that binning continuous data into quartiles substantially enhances model accuracy, precision, recall, and computational efficiency. In particular, the binned data enables the BP-ANN to achieve an accuracy of approximately 90.4%, with regression models such as KNN and MLPRegressor outperforming this benchmark by attaining accuracies exceeding 93%. Additionally, binning drastically reduced hyperparameter tuning duration from around 149 minutes to less than 10 minutes, underscoring its computational efficiency advantage. Overall, this research demonstrates that quantile-based data binning is a valuable preprocessing technique that improves predictive accuracy, reduces computational cost, and enhances the reliability of classical machine learning models for military resource forecasting."

This limitation can lead to prolonged execution times in batch processing scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Spark Batch Application Scheduling Method (SBASM) that incorporates application execution time awareness, combining an Improved Bottom-Up Left-Justified (IBL) algorithm with a Genetic Algorithm (GA). In this method, the batch application scheduling problem is formulated as a two-dimensional bin-packing problem. Application execution times are predicted using a polynomial regression model trained on historical execution data. Based on these predictions, the IBL algorithm integrated with GA is employed to perform efficient scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SBASM significantly reduces the execution time of batch applications and outperforms several existing Spark baseline models."

This is the first of its kind to replicate the inception of an electrodeless DHS, mirroring various observations made by the atmospheric electricity community [1]. By utilizing guided ionization waves from an Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Jet (APPJ) device, the experiment achieved excellent reproducibility and predictability in triggering DHS formation. The experimental approach effectively created conditions that align with several assumptions, such as maintaining an initial preionized column of free charges before breakdown [2]. This model closely matches numerous simulation results found in modeling literature [2], [3]. The positive and negative streamers were distinctly identified, showing simultaneous counter-propagation from the breakdown location. The high stability of the discharge allowed for advanced diagnostics, including time- and space-resolved optical emission spectroscopy. This enabled the first measurements of velocity growth, gas temperature, and electric field of a DHS. The electric field values confirmed the identification of positive and negative streamers. Notably, the electric field diagnostics revealed that a DHS can ignite under sub-breakdown conditions, highlighting the essential role of preionization in DHS formation. These findings support the theory proposed in [2]. While further research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms, these results pave the way for deeper investigations into the early stages of sprite discharges and other poorly understood phenomena in atmospheric electricity using affordable laboratory-scale experiments."

Finite element simulations were conducted on catamaran models with different laminate thicknesses, and reliability analysis of the model's transverse bending moment and torque was performed according to the relevant standards. Combined with the response surface design method, mathematical models were established regarding laminate thickness, the total weight of the catamaran, and the strength under various working conditions. Considering the conflicts between multiple objectives, a multi-objective genetic algorithm was used for optimization. The optimization results show that the catamaran optimized using the multi-objective genetic algorithm has reduced its weight by 23.46% compared to the original weight. Although there is a slight reduction in structural strength, the calculated beta is 5.26, reliability is 0.999987, which still meets the reliability requirements of the standard. This achieves an efficient balance between lightweight design and reliability, providing a robust pathway for ship structure lightweight design."

Traditional methods, exemplified by the gradient-descent-based Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm, suffer from a performance that is highly sensitive to the input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Conversely, contemporary deep learning techniques, while effective, are predominantly supervised, necessitating extensive labeled data for training, and are often characterized by computationally intensive network structures. This paper introduces an unsupervised spectrogram enhancement algorithm founded on a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network to surmount these challenges. The proposed algorithm leverages a lightweight Bi-LSTM architecture to achieve exhaustive encoding of tonal features from temporal of the received signals. Experimental validation through simulations indicates that the proposed algorithm yields an SNR gain of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$12.58 \\mathbf{d B}$</tex> when the input SNR is equivalent to the critical SNR of the LMS.

    "abstract": "During long-term storage, butchering and transportation of bonito, the temperature must be kept below −50°C, because of causing a color change of the meat by that myoglobin converts to metmyoglobin by the decomposition of ATP, which is the material keeping fish freshness, over −50°C. This peculiarity brings in high equipment costs. If it is possible to resynthesis ATP also after death of the fish by fishing, it is thought that it will be possible to suppress decreasing ATP and keep the freshness of the fish. ATP synthesis is carried out by supplying energy from the membrane potential of biological membranes. Therefore, if the potential can be generated in the biological membrane even after the death of the fish, it may be possible to resynthesize ATP. For that, we consider using pulsed power technology. Pulsed electric field can apply the potential to the biological membrane depending on the applied pulse conditions without thermally affecting the target object. In this presentation, the resynthesis amount of ATP in bonito meat when a damping oscillation waveform is applied was investigated. As a result of the experiment, it was found that the pulse condition of 16 kHz of the damping oscillation frequency, 5 kV/cm of the electric field intensity, and 1400 shots of the number of applied pulses were better condition for ATP resynthesis. Furthermore, pieces of the meat of bonito were stored in a freezer set at −6°C after applying the pulsed high electric field. Then, the change in color of the meat of bonito and the rate of conversion from myoglobin to metmyoglobin for the elapsed time were investigated. As a result, it is found that application of the pulse high electric field can suppress the conversion myoglobin to metmyoglobin in the meat of bonito."

    "abstract": "The electric field strength on the plasma membrane of a living cell exposed to a pulsed electric field (PEF) of sub-MV/m is automatically enhanced and exceeds <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$100 \\text{MV} / \\mathrm{m}$</tex>. While electric fields of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$100 \\text{MV} / \\mathrm{m}$</tex> are known to permeabilize phospholipid membranes, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations predict that they affect the function and structure of membrane proteins. There is growing interest in the effects of PEF on proteins, not only from a scientific perspective, but also in terms of its application to the physical control of protein function and structure, and the denaturation of proteins that occurs during the field sterilization of food products. However, it is not easy to identify PEF effects on proteins in living cells because other biological events such as <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{Ca}^{2+}$</tex> ion influx and subsequent biochemical reactions make it difficult to identify PEF effects on proteins. Previously, we experimentally demonstrated that electrical pulses with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$20 \\text{MV} / \\mathrm{m}$</tex> or more denature urease proteins in aqueous solution. Furthermore, we reported that electrical pulses on the order of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$100 \\text{MV} / \\mathrm{m}$</tex> disassembled transthyretin aggregates. Based on these studies, we have experimentally investigated the effects of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$100 \\text{MV} / \\mathrm{m}$</tex> class electric fields on the hierarchical structures of proteins in this study. Two proteins, egg white ovalbumin (OVA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA), with similar molecular weights and different structures, exposed to 10 times of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$130 \\text{MV} / \\mathrm{m}$</tex>, sub-nanosecond pulses, 1 ns, were analyzed and compared in the respective hierarchical structures. Native-PAGE showed that PEFs with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0.5 \\text{MV} / \\mathrm{m}$</tex> or more altered the tertiary structure of OVA but not of BSE.

Thiol group (TG) quntification indicates that the tertiary structure of OVA was loosen by the cleavage of the sole disulfide bond, whereas no significant change was observed in BSE. Circular dichroism (CD) analysis indicates significant changes in the secondary structure of neither OVA nor BSA. Throughout the experiment, pH and temperature remained unchanged. Hydrogen peroxide concentration was not changed significantly to affect the three-dimensional structure of proteins."

We propose optimizing the plasma actuator placement through parametric studies to achieve the most efficient flow control scheme possible by maximizing the flow control using flow interaction methods similar to the ones implemented in vortex generators installed on trucks. In this numerical study, we have developed a computational model in OpenFOAM that couples fluid flow with plasma discharge physics. This model accurately simulates the plasma discharge and the ionic wind generated by DBD actuators, the flow control characteristics of the DBD plasma actuator, and is validated against available experimental data in the literature, to ensure a robust representation of plasma-fluid interactions."

Its reliable operation is related to the success of fusion experiment and has important research value. When conducting system simulation analysis on SNU, it is necessary to model the system circuit, and the degree of parameter conformity between the model and the real equipment is crucial for the authenticity and reliability of the system simulation and analysis. The SNU scheme based on full-controlled solid-state switch with a steady-state breaking capacity of 47 kA was designed, and the transfer function of the steady-state 47 kA full-controlled solid-state switch in the SNU scheme and the SNU was constructed on the basis of taking into account equipment parameters and structural characteristics.

    "abstract": "Magnetron sputtering is a widely used process for thin-film deposition, employed in laboratory research and industry. It is based on a low-pressure plasma discharge in which ions of a working gas, typically argon, are created and accelerated toward a target containing the source material. Sputtering from the target releases target atoms into the gas phase that can condense on a substrate to form a thin film. High-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) achieves high discharge current densities by pulsing the discharge at a low duty cycle. This process generates a dense plasma region through which sputtered atoms pass with a high probability of becoming ionized. The resulting highly ionized flux of film-forming species enables for example the deposition of dense, crystalline and well-adhering thin films."

    "abstract": "Particle simulations are an effective tool for modeling the magnetically insulated transmission lines (MITL) on Sandia National Laboratories' Z machine. However, a fluid-like understanding is desirable for analyzing behavior and would aid in designing new geometries that mitigate current loss. Previous analysis of PIC simulations of the inner MITL suggests that the Hall current plays a significant role in time-dependent current loss. In this work we use Weak Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy), a data-driven model identification method, to quantify the Hall coefficient as a function of time and space in the inner MITL. The weak formulation of WSINDy allows us to perform this analysis without a smoothing or averaging step and work directly with fluid quantities calculated from the particle data. The Hall coefficient is learned for multiple inner MITL geometries and spatiotemporal regions of significance are identified. The end goal is a parameterization to represent how the geometry of the inner MITL relates to the Hall coefficient and the resulting current loss."

    "abstract": "Although a couple of robust cooperative controllers have been proposed to achieve the multi-tug towing of unactuated offshore platform with uncertainties and unknown disturbances, the convergence performance of towing control system is unsatisfactory. To surmount this challenge, this research aims to improve the convergence performance of multi-tug towing system based on fixed-time stability theory. Initially, a fixed-time extended state observer (FxESO) is designed to estimate the uncertainties and disturbances. Based on the FxESO, a fixed-time virtual controller is proposed to acquire desired drag force for the offshore platform to track the expected trajectory. Subsequently, the desired drag force is allocated to the desired towline tensions of tugs by the quadratic programming algorithm, and the corresponding desired towline length is calculated through the towline catenary model. Then, the desired position of each tug is obtained based on the desired towline length and the current position information of the platform and tug. Based on the desired positions of tugs, a fixed-time distributed cooperative controller is designed to achieve the multi-tug towing of offshore platform within the fixed time. Finally, simulations and comparisons have verified the progressiveness and effectiveness of the proposed method."

The present work extends the process of digital modulation scheme selection for SEU-resilience to a generalized procedure for a full radio frequency (RF) receiver. Two custom modulation schemes are optimized for Manhattan or Euclidean distance to minimize the system-level SEU impact of an single-event transient (SET) within individual circuits. Pulsed-laser single-event effect (SEE) testing is utilized to evaluate SEU-hardening of a SiGe wireless receiver operating on these custom modulation schemes. Basic receiver archetypes are used as test cases to determine the efficacy of system-level radiation hardening through modulation scheme selection. Results demonstrate that intentionally selecting modulation schemes based on known component sensitivity can reduce system-level SEU rates."

We consider PCA under the assumption that the high-dimensional data points are equipped with Gaussian uncertainty. Several approaches to such uncertainty-aware PCA have been developed recently in the visualization community. Since PCA is a discontinuous map, a small uncertainty in the data points can result in a huge uncertainty in the projected points. We show that the uncertainty of the data points also creates uncertainty in the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix that defines the PCA projection. We present a closed-form expression to quantify eigenvector uncertainty. Based on this, we propose a 3D glyph that supports the decision whether existing solutions for uncertainty-aware PCA are sufficient, or whether a more expensive sampling-based approach is required. We apply our approach to several test data sets."

However, the imaginary time correlation functions (ITCF) estimated by QMC simulation must be analytically continuated back to real time to extract dynamic information about the system. One of the most ubiquitous approaches to analytic continuation is the maximum entropy method (MEM). The MEM is typically used with Bryan's controversial algorithm [Rothkopf, “Bryan's Maximum Entropy Method” Data 5.3 (2020)]. We supply a dual Newton optimization algorithm to be used within the MEM that addresses known issues. We pay special attention to our uncertainty providing analytic bounds for the algorithm's error as well as numerical estimates of the uncertainty arising from both the ITCF and the regularization weight. We use the MEM to investigate authentic quantum Monte Carlo data for the uniform electron gas and further substantiate the roton-type feature in the dispersion relation, demonstrating that the all-purpose maximum entropy method can reliably estimate the DSF from QMC data. This establishes a path towards model-free estimates of the DSF in ion-electron systems."

We begin by examining common sensor modalities (monocular/stereo cameras, RGB-D, LiDAR, mmWave radar) and their integration into mapping frameworks such as TSDF/ESDF, OctoMap, Voxblox/Nvblox, and NDT-OM. Next, we detail adaptations of these methods for agricultural and forestry applications. Finally, we address the emerging challenge of estimating solid ground beneath vegetation and constructing traversability maps through statistical models, proprioceptive–exteroceptive fusion, radar sensing, and self-supervised deep learning. By comparing state-of-the-art algorithms and datasets, we identify key trade-offs between memory efficiency, map fidelity, and real-time performance. We conclude with recommendations for integrating uncertainty-aware and active-perception strategies, and outline future directions toward scalable, cloud-based, multi-robot mapping for precision agriculture and forestry management."

The approach, named Electro-Magnetic Decoupling (EMD) preconditioner, decomposes the discrete system into vector and scalar potential components and applies tailored preconditioners to each. In particular, strong preconditioning is applied to the scalar component to address the spectral degradation induced by the discrete Laplacian. The method was evaluated on four eddy current models with varying frequencies, conductor topologies, and excitation types. Compared to the conventional incomplete Cholesky preconditioner, the EMD approach achieved up to 33 times fewer iteration counts and up to 28 times faster iterative solver time. Moreover, the method supports physics-level parallelization, allowing efficient treatment of independently excited conductor domains. The EMD framework is compatible with algebraic multigrid, domain decomposition, and direct solvers, offering flexibility and robustness for large-scale electromagnetic simulations."

The study finds that intelligent support and the convenience of learning resources, as pull factors, have a significant positive impact on behavioral intentions, while concerns about technological dependence serve as the primary mooring barrier. Additionally, push factors, such as traditional educational content, the lack of personalized support, and insufficient interactivity, were also verified. The research suggests that parents’ adoption decisions regarding AIGC are a complex process of weighing technological benefits and risks. To promote the sustainable development of AIGC in education, efforts should focus on enhancing technological awareness, updating educational concepts, and building systemic trust. This study provides a theoretical framework and empirical basis for understanding parental decision-making mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, modern power systems are facing increasing complexity with the rapid growth of renewable energy sources (RESs), the expansion of small and distributed energy resources (DERs) and the evolution towards cyber-physical smart grids. These developments have made the need for intelligent and flexible systems to support the decision-making processes. Advanced large linguistic models (LLM), as a new generation of artificial intelligence (AI), can understand and process complex text data and have been proposed as an innovative solution in the energy industry. These technologies can create a fundamental transformation in power systems management and optimization. This paper analyzes in depth the application of LLM in power systems. The current research tracks the evolution of AI in this field from simple methods, based on basic rules, to more advanced technologies, such as deep learning and transformer models. Within the paper, the basic principles of transformer models are described, and three important capabilities of this technology are emphasized: the ability to interpret the results, the ability to expand for different applications, and the flexibility to face different conditions. The conducted analysis highlights how the new generation of AI can bring a fundamental transformation in the management of power systems."

    "abstract": "Human motion synthesis has advanced significantly in domains such as text-to-motion and gesture generation, yet synthesising realistic interaction motion between multiple characters remains relatively underexplored, particularly in dynamic and user-driven environments like virtual reality (VR). Existing approaches rely on constructing sequences across a set number of frames, inherently limiting their usability in real-time and open-ended applications such as virtual reality. In this work, we present a novel latent diffusion-based framework for real-time interaction motion synthesis. Unlike prior models that operate on fixed-length sequences, our system continuously adapts to user behaviour, generating contextually appropriate and temporally coherent response motions. We introduce Interaction Contact Labels, a generalisation of ground contact annotations, to capture physical interdependencies between interacting characters and integrate them into the training objective to improve realism. Our approach enables open-ended, responsive character interactions suitable for live applications in VR, AR, and robotics. Further to this, we demonstrate a real-time implementation of the proposed method, which utilises CycleGANs to combine webcam data with high-quality motion capture data, allowing for easy end-user set-up."

    "abstract": "Fluid moment models are an attractive option to model plasma devices because they can describe macroscopic device-scale phenomena of an ensemble of particles without need to track myriad particle trajectories. In plasma devices, non-equilibrium (non-Maxwellian) effects can arise due to coupling between plasma-wall interactions, interspecies collisions and instabilities. While kinetic models can describe arbitrary velocity distribution functions, such models are generally more computationally expensive than traditional fluid models. In this study, we develop and apply a 10moment multi-fluid model to capture non-equilibrium anisotropic effects in low-temperature magnetized plasmas. The model solves for the density, bulk velocity and a full pressure tensor. The equations are closed by an extension of the traditional equilibrium Braginskii-type heat flux, obtained using Chapman-Enskog expansion. The one-dimensional model is applied to the simplified geometry of the discharge plasma in a Hall-effect thruster. The results are compared to previous 5-moment fluid results and kinetic particle-in-cell Monte Carlo collision model."

To address these issues, in this paper, we propose DGLN, a distributed GCN-based prediction architecture that employs a decentralized training paradigm comprising local and distributed systems. The local system is designed to capture scale-specific features of marine data across different processors, while the distributed system learns and coordinates global cross-timescale features. The graph learning module in the distributed system integrates graph features from other processors without transmitting raw data, thereby ensuring local data security. To accelerate training and enhance model performance, a joint learning module is composed by cross-timescale computation with a new global weighted consensus algorithm, which is able to adaptively adjust the weights of different scales. Experimental results show that DGLN is able to improve the local prediction accuracy and capture cross-timescale features effectively while improving the training efficiency."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral change detection (HSI-CD) serves as an advanced technique for monitoring surface changes by leveraging spectral differences between multi-temporal hyperspectral images. Ideally, the spectral differences between unchanged areas across multi-temporal images should be minimal. However, in practical applications, due to various factors such as imaging conditions and seasonal variations, spectral differences in unchanged areas can still be significant, which may lead to an increased likelihood of false alarms in CD. In this article, we propose a distinct reconstruction-guided approach for semi-supervised HSI-CD, termed CSR-Net, which can precisely distinguish the changed or unchanged areas with significant spectral differences. Specifically, CSR-Net encodes input HSI to reconstruct the corrected spectral sequences, mitigating errors caused by spectral differences in unchanged areas due to factors such as seasonal changes and variations in land cover characteristics. Subsequently, the reconstructed spectral sequences undergo change analysis to detect changes. Moreover, we propose an innovative semi-supervised HSI-CD loss, which weights the mean squared error loss based on binary CD results. This loss introduces a constraint that enables the model to learn spectral-temporal relationships from unlabeled data, thereby facilitating the reconstruction of corrected spectral sequences and reducing false alarms. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark HSI-CD datasets demonstrate that the proposed CSR-Net and loss function consistently outperform existing state-of-the-art methods, even with a very limited number of labeled samples."

    "abstract": "Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is a key technology in non-cooperative communication systems, aiming to identify the modulation scheme from signals without prior information. Deep learning (DL)-based methods have gained wide attention due to their excellent performance, but research mainly focuses on single-input single-output (SISO) systems, with limited exploration for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The confounding effects of multi-antenna channels can interfere with the statistical properties of MIMO signals, making identification particularly challenging. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Channel-Aware Multi-Domain feature extraction (CAMD) framework for AMR in MIMO systems. Our CAMD framework reconstructs the transmitted signal through an efficient channel compensation module and achieves a more robust representation capability against channel interference by extracting and integrating multi-domain features, including intra-antenna temporal correlations and inter-antenna channel correlations. We have verified our method on the widely-used dataset, MIMOSig-Ref, with complex mobile channel environments. Extensive experiments confirm the performance advantages of CAMD over previous state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a Uniform Dynamic Control (UDC) strategy to ensure consistent dynamic performance in nonlinear photovoltaic (PV) power systems. Conventional Static Gain Control (SGC), which applies fixed controller parameters, often results in bandwidth variation and unsee transient behavior due to the nonlinear voltage-power characteristics of PV arrays and their sensitivity to irradiance and load variations. These limitations become more critical in single-stage systems, where the lack of energy storage directly couples PV voltage to load dynamics. To address this, a small-signal model is developed to characterize the PV system's operating-point-dependent behavior and is extended to capture the coupled dynamics between PV voltage and load-side rotor speed in motor-driven applications. Based on this model, UDC adaptively tunes the controller gains to maintain uniform control bandwidth and consistent transient response across a wide range of conditions. Experimental validation confirms that the proposed UDC improves voltage regulation, enhances speed response uniformity, and reduces transient deviations, but also verifies that the developed small-signal model accurately captures the system's dynamic behavior."

The pulse modulation characteristics of the PFN play a pivotal role in determining the quasi-square wave pulse output of the PFN-Marx generator. As the demand for more compact devices grows, the inter-stage electromagnetic coupling arising from PFN wave propagation during the superposition process of the PFN-Marx generator influences its quasi-square wave out characteristics. This paper delves into this issue in detail. Initially, the optimal PFN types are selected by design and simulation. The experiments are conducted to investigate the quasi-square wave out characteristics of the PFN under varying impedance conditions and the impact of different arrangement structures on the waveform. On this basis, a 3D model of a typical PFN-Marx generator is established for field-circuit co-simulation and to optimal its wave propagation. Finally, a 5-stage PFN-Marx generator is built for experimental verification. The optimized single-stage PFN outputs a good flat-top waveform with a leading edge of 12 ns and a pulse width of 60 ns on a 3.5Ω load. The 5-stage PFN-Marx generator, under conditions of a charging voltage of 50 kV and a load of 20Ω, outputs a quasi-square wave with a peak value of 120 kV, a pulse width of 60 ns and a leading edge of 15 ns."

In reliance on these state augmentations, delay-resolved reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms train policies to learn optimal interactions with environments featuring observation or action delays. Although such methods can be directly trained on the real robots, due to sample inefficiency, limited resources, or safety constraints, a common approach is to transfer models trained in simulation to the physical robot. However, robotic simulations rely on approximated models of the physical systems, which hinders the sim2real transfer. In this work, we consider various uncertainties in modeling the robot or environment dynamics as unknown intrinsic disturbances applied to the system input. We introduce the disturbance-augmented Markov decision process (DAMDP) in delayed settings as a novel representation to incorporate disturbance estimation in training on-policy RL algorithms. The proposed method is validated across several metrics on learning robotic reaching and pushing tasks and compared with disturbance-unaware baselines. The results show that the disturbance-augmented models can achieve higher stabilization and robustness in the control response, which in turn improves the prospects of successful sim2real transfer."

    "abstract": "The growing power demands of AI- and ML based datacenters drive the need for higher power density in AC–DC power supply units without increasing their physical footprint. In isolated DC–DC stages, LLC resonant converters are favored for their high efficiency; however, achieving the large gain required during hold-up events via frequency modulation necessitates modifications to the resonant tank parameters that compromise nominal efficiency, resulting in oversized bulk capacitance. Secondary-side rectifier (SR) phase-shifting control can eliminate the dependence on magnetizing inductance, but extended freewheeling intervals require an increase in switching frequency to limit peak and RMS currents, which in turn broadens the frequency range and increases switching losses. This work introduces a selective SR phase-shifting control leveraging matrix transformers to mitigate these challenges. The approach is experimentally validated on a vertically mounted 400 V/50 V LLC converter module, achieving 98.7% peak efficiency and a surface power density of 1320 W/in<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>, while maintaining regulation over a 200–400 V input range.

This conventional approach presents challenges when measuring time-varying transmissions, as changes in the waveform must be considered throughout the entire measurement period. To address this challenge, we investigate methods to adapt signal acquisition for time-varying signals, evaluating the feasibility and limitations of using VNAs for this purpose. We analyze the sweep duration and evaluate a segmented sweep, conducting experimental verification to establish a measurement scenario. This scenario aims to improve our understanding of time-varying measurements and to apply it to other much more dynamic channel-sounding systems, enabling estimation of associated measurement uncertainties. We present the measurement setup, mathematical analysis to simulate the scenario, and time intervals obtained for each measured segment at varying velocities, considering the actual position at each frequency step."

For this purpose, we introduce a simplified interference index based on the channel covariance matrices and formulate an optimization problem by considering the interference index as the objective function and the scalability and pilot reuse parameters as the constraints. To find the solution of this NP-hard problem, we utilize the relaxation technique, the block coordinate descent (BCD) approach and the interior point method (IPM), which leads to a polynomial-time pilot and AP assignment algorithm whose iteration complexity scales as <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>(max(<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4.5</sup>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">LK</i><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3.5</sup>)) with the number of users <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i> and APs <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</i>.

The simulation results also show that the performance gain of the proposed scheme improves with increasing the network user density, which confirms its interference mitigation capability."

    "abstract": "Endmember extraction (EE) plays an essential role in the unmixing of hyperspectral images, and many EE algorithms have been proposed. Among them, evolutionary algorithm (EA) based EE algorithms attract much attention due to the EA's powerful global search ability. However, hyperspectral EE problem itself is a constrained and sparse large-scale optimization problem, and it is difficult to search the optimal solutions efficiently. In this paper, to address this problem, we tackle this complex optimization problem from the view of evolutionary multi-tasking. Specifically, an evolutionary multi-tasking method for hyperspectral EE, termed EMT-HEE, is suggested, where two related tasks cooperate with each other to achieve endmembers with higher quality. In EMT-HEE, the original hyperspectral EE problem is regarded as the main task, whose aim is to obtain the final accurate endmembers. Meanwhile, an unconstrained task is constructed to assist the main task, and is used to explore the sparse large-scale search space thoroughly and avoid the local optima. To implement the evolutionary multi-tasking idea, two populations (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$MP$</tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$AP$</tex-math></inline-formula>) are evolved for the two tasks, respectively. During the evolving, a learning based solution generation strategy is suggested for the main task, which can produce high-quality solutions. Besides, a global search strategy with dynamic ranges is developed for the assisting task, which generates the solutions with more diversity. To make full use of the advantage of each task, a pair of knowledge transferring strategy (including the “assisting-to-main repairing strategy” and the “main-to-assisting enhancing strategy”) is proposed, which improves the performance of each task greatly. The competitiveness of EMT-HEE is validated on different hyperspectral datasets, and EMT-HEE can extract more accurate endmembers than the state-of-the-art EE algorithms."

    "abstract": "Preserving user privacy while monitoring on-screen activity is a growing challenge in remote and decentralized work environments. In this paper, we propose a novel one-shot federated learning (FL) framework that enables secure, low-overhead, and privacy-preserving on-screen activity recognition. Conventional FL methods require multiple communication rounds between clients and a central server. In contrast, our one-shot FL approach performs model aggregation in a single round, significantly reducing communication costs and latency, making it ideal for bandwidth-constrained and resource-limited environments. Using a custom dataset of 2,300 screenshots from common applications (e.g., Coursera, YouTube, Amazon), we train Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) models such as VGG16, VGG19, and InceptionResNetV2 locally on client devices. Sensitive visual data is never shared, and the screenshots are processed and discarded post-inference, ensuring strict data confidentiality. We further enhance privacy by integrating differential privacy mechanisms. To further improve learning effectiveness under different data distributions, we evaluate two aggregation techniques, FedAvg for IID and FedProx for non-IID settings. Experimental evaluations show that our approach achieves up to 99.1% classification accuracy (MobileNet) while reducing communication overhead by over 80% compared to traditional FL. This work highlights the effectiveness and scalability of one-shot FL for secure, real-time activity tracking in privacy-sensitive applications."

By interacting with the second harmonic of the electron cyclotron frequency, gyrotrons can achieve double the output frequency compared to fundamental gyrotrons using the same magnet system. However, as the harmonic number increases, the coupling between the electron beam and the cavity modes becomes weaker. Also, strong competition from fundamental modes arises, making it essential to develop effective methods to suppress fundamental modes. To address this challenge, coaxial gyrotron cavities with specific impedance-corrugated inserts can be used [1,2]."

Third, to maintain equipment reliability evaluation, the Gibbs sampling method is employed to obtain marginal posterior distributions of each parameter. Finally, two case studies are conducted to discuss the application of the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed method provides more accurate reliability evaluation results in comparison with traditional methods.

Automated solutions are very useful considering that manual inspection tends to be time consuming, inaccurate, and uneconomical. New advances in computer vision and deep learning led to the possibility of accurate real-time detection of defects on low-cost hardware platforms. Edge AI for Industrial Quality Control discussed in this paper is a real-time system of edge-computing-based defect detection that aims to inspect damaged packages with the Jetson Nano and YOLOv11 model. A Multi-camera setup improves visibility and alleviate diminishing false negatives, and the lightweight installation can easily be extended to current conveyor systems. The difficulty of broken package detection is addressed through multi-camera framework and fine-tuned object detection, where the system is robust to various conditions and classifies packages as good/bad. Our validation on an experimental dataset of custom-made data material provided high detection rates and precision across inference speeds conducive to real-time inspection.

A failure in any single device can disrupt the entire business process, resulting in substantial losses. Currently, research on distributed training is still inadequate, and there is a lack of targeted models and methods for reliability assessment. Therefore, this paper analyzes the typical failure modes and failure mechanisms of distributed training networks from the connectivity layer, performance layer, and business layer. It proposes a multi-agent simulation-based reliability assessment method for distributed training networks and establishes a simulation test platform to conduct reliability simulation assessments centered around distributed training operations. This provides a reference for the study of distributed training network reliability analysis and supports the implementation of reliability design and enhancement efforts for distributed training networks."

While most video summarization studies focus on extracting salient scenes using lowlevel visual features, they often neglect the storytelling aspect to optimize numerical performance on standard benchmarks. To address this, we propose a multifaceted video summarization method that leverages vision and language foundation models to assess shot-level importance (e.g., 2-sec intervals) based on both visual salience and textual narrativity. Specifically, our method employs a vision-language model (VLM) to generate objective captions for individual shots. These shot-wise textual descriptions are then fed into a large language model (LLM) with a prompt designed to produce a semantically-coherent text summary with strong narrativity. The narrativity-aware text embeddings obtained by the LLM, combined with visual embeddings from a vision foundation model, are processed by a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict importance scores. The LLM and RNN are jointly fine-tuned to align with existing benchmarks. Experiments on the SumMe benchmark demonstrated the effectiveness of our multifaceted approach, highlighting significant performance improvements and the potential of text-domain video summarization."

Traditionally, VA testing requires patients to read optotypes aloud from a distance, with an assistant present to record the responses. Speech-enabled automation has been explored, however these solutions are highly susceptible to performance degradation from ambient noise and speech crosstalk: a common challenge in real-world, multilane clinical environments. In this work, we introduce a novel multimodal pipeline system that combines audio and visual speech recognition to enable robust and accurate VA transcription even under noisy conditions. By integrating synchronized microphone and camera inputs, our architecture employs advanced noise and crosstalk detection, and utilizes a dynamic decision module to intelligently select between audio-based ASR and lip-reading outputs based on real-time environmental analysis. To further improve accuracy under crosstalk conditions, we introduce a lip-guided audio masking mechanism that suppresses non-target speech by detecting when the patient is actively speaking. This multimodal pipeline represents a significant advancement for automated vision screening, offering enhanced transcription accuracy and reliability where single modality systems fail. Preliminary results demonstrate that the addition of lip-reading achieves a 33% and 16% relative reduction in word error rate (WER) compared to the audio-only baseline on the three-speaker and two-speaker crosstalk visual acuity test sets, respectively."

This study investigates the transformative potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation integrated with Large Language Models (RAG-LLM) in public service innovation through architectural analysis and cross-national case studies of Estonia, Singapore, and the European Union. By examining RAG-LLM implementations across legal, administrative, and multilingual domains, the research identifies critical success factors in governance models, interoperability frameworks, and data standardization.Key findings reveal that centralized architectures (Estonia’s Kratt ecosystem, Singapore’s AIBots) enable rapid scaling through unified standards, while federated models (EU’s cross-border system) balance sovereignty with collaboration. Hybrid retrieval strategies-combining keyword-based and semantic search-and domain-specific embeddings reduce hallucinations by up to 63%, ensuring compliance and accuracy in high-stakes scenarios. Operational efficiencies are significant: Estonia processes 1.2M monthly queries with 89% resolution rates, Singapore automates 40% more citizen inquiries, and the EU reduces permit processing from six weeks to three days. Citizen satisfaction rates (82–98%) correlate with transparency features (source citations, multilingual support) and inclusive design.The study underscores that RAG-LLM systems act as force multipliers for public sector innovation when supported by adaptive governance, continuous data quality management, and standardized evaluation metrics. Challenges persist in generalizability to less digitized contexts, ethical governance, and evolving regulatory landscapes. Policy recommendations emphasize interoperability frameworks, domain-tuned standardization, and human-AI collaboration to realize scalable, trustworthy, and citizen-centric services."

However, further improving the performance of NAR-ST models remains a challenging and important research direction. To this end, we propose UTRo-NAST, a novel NAR-ST framework that decomposes speech translation into three consecutive subtasks: source speech understanding, word-level translation, and target-side word reordering. The model first encodes the source speech into high-level acoustic representations, which are then translated into a sequence of target words. Finally, the sequence is reordered to match the syntactic and grammatical structure of the target language. By modularizing the speech translation pipeline, UTRo-NAST enhances model interpretability, robustness, and overall performance. Experiments on the MuST-C benchmark across eight language pairs show that UTRo-NAST consistently outperforms existing NAR-ST models and achieves translation quality comparable to strong autoregressive baselines, while maintaining faster decoding speed. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed framework for practical speech translation."

In recent years, several methods based on deep learning have been proposed, enabling easier and more accurate recognition. In this study, we focused on the bi-directional Transformer for musical chord recognition (BTC), a chord recognition method based on Transformers, and evaluated its performance. The experimental results showed that the chord recognition accuracy for the triads was <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{7 5. 5 2 \\%}$</tex>, which is insufficient for realworld music applications.

    "abstract": "Based on the location, contour, and size of the Optic Disc (OD) and Optic Cup (OC) in fundus images, several eye diseases can be diagnosed. For example, glaucoma is identified by the cup-to-disc ratio, while papilledema is characterized by optic disc swelling, an unclear contour, and disappearance of the optic cup. Therefore, OD and OC segmentation not only assists clinicians in diagnosing various eye diseases but also enables the development of automated diagnostic systems. Although numerous OD and OC segmentation methods have been proposed, segmentation remains challenging in cases where the contours of the OD or OC are unclear, as is often the case in certain eye diseases. To address this, this paper proposes a Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT)-UNet model for OD and OC segmentation from fundus images. The NAT architecture is designed to extract discriminative features capable of identifying unclear contours associated with pathological lesions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, data from glaucomatous and healthy eyes were obtained from a publicly available database. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately segment the OD and OC in fundus images."

This paper proposes an intelligent evaluation method using deep learning (Transformer). Firstly, an agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) framework is developed to generate 16,000 samples. Then, eight core indicators (such as radar detection distance, photoelectric monitoring accuracy, etc.) were selected by using the grey relational analysis method (GRA), and a three-layer evaluation system was constructed. The Transformer model is introduced to model the nonlinear relationship between multi-source parameters and predict the core indicators: strike success rate <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\left(Y_{1}\\right)$</tex> and interception success rate <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\left(Y_{2}\\right)$</tex>.

Insufficient manufacturing capabilities lead to product failures or a series of quality accidents. Frequent quality accidents will bring poor product experience to users and cause huge economic and reputation losses to manufacturers. In this context, the continuous maturity of artificial intelligence technology has made it possible to efficiently and intelligently identify the root causes of product quality accidents and failures. To find the root causes of quality accidents and reduce the consequences of frequent quality accidents, a root cause identification scheme for quality accidents based on knowledge graph (KG) and large language model (LLM) is proposed. First, the connotation of quality accidents is proposed, and the formation mechanism of quality accidents in the big data context is explained with product reliability as the core. Secondly, a novel root cause analysis method of quality accidents is established based on the KG and LLM. Finally, a steam turbine is taken as the illustrated example to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method."

To overcome this issue, we propose a novel optimization technique called Monomial Equivalence - Interleaved Training (ME-IT) to augment well-known optimizers. ME-IT periodically applies a monomial matrix transform-a computationally cheap, loss-preserving transformation that leverages the inherent symmetries of the network. This “re-locates” the model to a functionally identical but parametrically different location on the loss level-set, enabling the network to explore the loss surface and find favorable points for continued gradient descent. Experiments on the MNIST dataset demonstrate that ME-IT-applied models converge significantly faster and discover final solutions with lower loss and higher accuracy than their state-of-the-art counterparts. A test accuracy improvement of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\sim 0.3 \\%$</tex> is achieved on the MNIST dataset with respect to the model with Cosine Annealing with Warm Restarts, and a training speedup of around <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2 \\times$</tex> is reached for shorter training sessions.

This motion is characterized by a temporal pattern in which the eyelids gradually close over time. While Transformers are well suited for modeling such temporal patterns, they primarily capture global dependencies across an entire sequence and may overlook subtle local changes. In addition, slight misalignments caused by camera shake, subject movement, or environmental variations across frames can make these fine-grained patterns even more difficult to detect. To address these issues, we aim to extract and exploit fine-grained local temporal variations in the periocular region while maintaining robustness to environmental changes and misalignment. Specifically, the proposed approach combines detailed, semantically meaningful feature extraction using GC <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> SA-Net, fine-grained inter-frame difference extraction via a token-exchange-based difference evaluation (TEDE) module, and Transformer-based sequence modeling. This design complements the Transformer's strength in modeling long-range temporal context by enhancing its sensitivity to subtle local changes and improving robustness to environmental variation and frame misalignment. Experiments on care-scene video data of a child with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities, who expresses discomfort or pain through strong eye closure, demonstrate that incorporating TEDE-based difference information significantly improves detection accuracy for strong eye closure."

Additionally, a robustness evaluation system combining network structure and passenger transportation functionality is established. Simulation analysis is conducted using Xi'an urban area as a case study. The results show that the capacity control parameters and overload coefficient significantly affect the robustness of the bus-metro coupled network in Xi'an. In the cascading process model established in this paper, when the two capacity control parameters are 0.23 and 0.1, and the overload coefficient is 0.2, the coupled network has high economic efficiency and robustness. Research reveals that dynamic critical nodes have a significant impact on network robustness indicators, and targeted protection can effectively enhance network robustness.

However, this technology also poses significant risks to voice privacy, such as fraud via cloned voices and unauthorized access to speaker authentication systems. Recent research efforts have focused on preventing such imitation using adversarial examples. When applied to speech, such examples, or adversarial speech, can cause voice cloning models to synthesize speech signals that differ from the target voice, thereby protecting audio privacy. A previous study demonstrated the effectiveness of adversarial speech, which is optimized based on a simple loss function with only the target speaker's embedding. In this study, we propose a novel adversarial speech generation method, incorporating an anchor speaker embedding into a loss function to enhance the protective performance from objective and subjective perspectives. We also propose a method that uses Adam to optimize the noise added to the original speech to generate adversarial speech. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is superior to the conventional method in objective and subjective metrics."

In our previous work, we proposed StreamCodec, which enables streamable speech coding by leveraging model causalization and a scalar-vectorcombined quantization strategy, but its reconstructed quality and complexity still have room for improvement. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved iteration of StreamCodec, named StreamCodec2. The StreamCodec2 supports streamable and lightweight speech coding by adopting a fully causal architecture and reducing the convolutional channels. To compensate for the speech quality degradation caused by model causalization and pruning, we introduce a non-causal, high-complexity teacher codec to guide the training of StreamCodec2 through knowledge distillation. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed StreamCodec2, trained with the knowledge distillation strategy, can achieve high-quality speech reconstruction while maintaining low latency (only 20 ms), low computational complexity (only 910 MFLOPs), and low model complexity (only 5.4 M parameters)."

While traditional DBIM is effective in solving inverse scattering problems, it often exhibits slow convergence and poor performance under noisy conditions due to the accumulation of high-variance noise components across iterations. To overcome this, we embed a PCA-based filtering step into each iteration, which adaptively retains the most informative components of the current reconstruction and suppresses noise-dominated directions. Numerical simulations under varying problem sizes, with a fixed number of measurements, demonstrate that the PCA-enhanced DBIM significantly reduces the normalized reconstruction error—achieving up to 36 % error reduction compared to standard DBIM—and exhibits faster convergence, particularly in underdetermined scenarios. These results confirm that PCA not only improves the stability and robustness of the inversion process but also serves as an effective spatial regularizer, making it a promising tool for enhancing the quality and efficiency of iterative acoustic imaging methods."

The captured image is then sent for processing, where Tesseract OCR extracts and separates individual characters. Each recognized character is then converted into speech output through a speaker, while simultaneously being represented in digital Braille format using a set of six servos arranged in a standard Braille cell (2×3 layout).

However, this method of encoding messages has one limitation: the length of the message is fixed, requiring VAE reconstruction whenever the length changes. To solve this problem, we propose a converter consisting of an encoder and a decoder based on random networks. Our method enables the handling of arbitrary message lengths without reconstructing the VAE. We evaluated the image quality of stego-images generated using this method, as well as the accuracy and robustness of the watermarks against attacks. The results confirmed that our method achieves higher accuracy and robustness against attacks while providing image quality comparable to that of DiffuseTrace.

The developed system achieved a 93% accuracy in JSON formatting, 97.75% answer retrievability, and a question-answer relevance score of 0.9875. Additionally, the low output variability (0.2934) underscores the system’s capacity to generate questions that are diverse and semantically coherent. These results suggest that AI-driven automation substantially reduces resource requirements while enhancing the consistency and accessibility of IELTS practice materials."

    "abstract": "A general-purpose, data-driven machine learning (ML) system was developed for quality prediction in manufacturing. The developed system addresses the inefficiencies and human errors of traditional quality control methods, which delay defect detection, product recalls, or legal risks. While Industry 4.0 technologies, particularly ML, enable predictive analytics and process optimization, existing solutions are scenario-specific, so they lack adaptability across diverse manufacturing settings. To overcome this limitation, we investigated the needs of three different manufacturing companies (A, B, and C) through interviews and identified system requirements such as integration of heterogeneous data, flexible model deployment, real-time monitoring, anomaly alerts, and compatibility with multiple platforms. The developed system was implemented in Python, featuring an extract, load, transform (ELT) pipeline using Apache Spark (PySpark) and Apache Airflow for large-scale data processing and automation. A lightweight web-based interface developed with Streamlit enables users to explore data, adjust parameters, and visualize results interactively. The system performs data integration, machine learning model deployment, real-time visualization, and quality analytics. Ultimately, the system supports data-driven decision-making, improves production efficiency, reduces defect rates, and strengthens competitiveness through a stable, accurate, and scalable architecture."

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have emerged as critical components in modern intelligent systems, particularly in remote monitoring, smart agriculture, industrial automation, and environmental surveillance. Nonetheless, there is a fundamental problem when it comes to deploying them in practice: bounded energy supplies on sensor nodes, which has a devastating effect on network lifetime and throughput. In order to overcome this, we shall develop an Intelligent Sleep/Awake Node Scheduling Protocol (ISANSP), which will optimize energy consumption, improve routing efficiency and not to compromise the coverage or data integrity of the network. A fuzzy-based classification and priority of the nodes are also integrated into the protocol so that only few critical and intermediate nodes are activated after other redundant nodes are placed into the sleep mode effectively. It is combined with energy-conscientious and clustering (LEACH, HEED) and utilizes the sleep-aware multiple-hop local area network routing to enable symmetrical drain in energy. The performance of ISANSP is shown by simulation results on a 100m x 100m field using 150 nodes that show that the system clearly outperforms conventional protocols. In particular, the protocol has an average PDR of 96.76% as compared to LEACH and TDMA protocols, a network lifetime extension of 40.20%, and residual energy saving of 28.4%. Although average latency does increase slightly (to 130.66 ms), that sacrifice is quite worth the much more network robustness and energy efficiency it produced. On top of this, the active node number is always very large during the simulation which will guarantee continued network operation. Consequently, the ISANSP deployment of adaptive scheduling as the intelligence behind energy-aware routing and fault-tolerant approaches provides a potentially desirable means to overcome the next-generation energy-constrained WSN. Being modular in nature, the protocol can be scaled to a variety of application areas that involve long duration independent deployments."

    "abstract": "Thailand’s rubber plantations in more than 3.2 million ha, are economically significant and ecologically valuable as potential long-term carbon sinks. However, their contributions to carbon sequestration are currently omitted from the national Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory due to the absence of standardized net ecosystem productivity (NEP) estimation methods and robust field-based validation. This study aims to include it in NEP by integrating multi-source satellite data, including Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer vegetation indices, Global OCO-2-based Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence, and TerraClimate meteorological parameters with machine learning techniques and estimating NEP across rubber-growing regions. The validation of models was performed on ground-truth using Eddy Covariance data obtained from CRRC and NST, representing plantations of different ages and canopy structures. Among the tested models, random forest achieved the best performance (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.913 in training and 0.715 in testing), accurately capturing biophysical and climatic interactions. The predicted NEP values were used to draw high-resolution carbon maps, publicly accessible via Check Carbon, a mobile application developed by the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency. This tool allows farmers, researchers, and policymakers to evaluate spatial patterns of carbon sequestration across Thailand. The study of the results showed that well-managed rubber plantations are effective carbon sinks and highlight the importance of including such ecosystems in national carbon accounting frameworks and climate mitigation policies. This integration ensures digital innovation with sustainable carbon planning."

In this paper, we revisit DOA estimation using a recently introduced dataset constructed with the assistance of large language models (LLMs), which provides more diverse spatial audio scenes. We benchmark several representative neural network-based DOA methods on this dataset and propose LightDOA, a lightweight DOA estimation model based on depthwise separable convolutions and a gated recurrent unit, specifically designed for mutil-channel input in varying environments. Experimental results show that LightDOA achieves satisfactory accuracy and robustness across various acoustic scenes while maintaining low computational complexity. This study highlights the potential of LLM-assisted synthetic datasets for advancing DOA research, and demonstrates LightDOA as an efficient solution for resource-constrained applications."

This method eliminates the need for manual phonetic transcription, reducing costs and enhancing scalability, especially for large non-transcribed audio datasets. Our model matches the performance of conventional G2P-based text-tospeech systems and is capable of synthesizing speech that retains natural linguistic and paralinguistic features, such as accents and intonations."

While conventional traffic signal control methods, such as fixed-time or rule-based strategies, are still widely used, they often fail to adapt to complex traffic dynamics, especially in urban roundabouts. This study proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for intelligent traffic signal control, specifically trained and tested in the Gongguan Roundabout in Taipei, Taiwan-an intersection with high traffic volumes and asymmetric geometry. A simulation setup is created using the SUMO software, and a Recurrent Proximal Policy Optimization (R-PPO) algorithm with LSTM memory is used to address partial observability and temporal dependencies in the traffic flow. Experiments conducted under different traffic conditions, including peak traffic hours, demand fluctuations, and incident disruptions, demonstrated that the proposed R-PPO framework significantly outperforms baseline strategies. These findings highlight the effectiveness of memoryenhanced DRL in achieving adaptive, stable, and fair traffic signal control in real-world roundabout scenarios."

    "abstract": "The high mobility of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) leads to constant changes in node positioning, which disrupts communication links and affects overall network stability. Therefore, routing protocols such as the conventional Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) have been widely utilised in mobile ad hoc networks to ensure reliable data delivery. However, AODV’s on-demand routing nature leads to repetitive distribution of routing packets to re-establish overwritten routes, which is especially detrimental for low-data-rate communication networks such as Long Range (LoRa). This paper introduces an AODV-inspired routing protocol that integrates a next-hop caching strategy alongside a multi-route memory mechanism, enhanced by weight-based route selection. A proof-of-concept implementation is conducted in a real-world mesh network consisting of five static LoRa nodes and a mobile LoRa node traversing the network. Experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol is functional and achieves reductions in average routing latency of 19µs and end-to-end latency of 796.44s compared to the standard AODV protocol. These reductions in latency are vital for enabling efficient data delivery in dynamic topology networks.

    "abstract": "The rapid development of malware, characterized by obfuscation, polymorphism, and sandbox evasion techniques, has seriously challenged traditional detection mechanisms. Although widely adopted for the dynamic analysis of malware, sandboxes often fail to detect sophisticated malware variants. DMDA is a new approach that overcomes these shortcomings by adaptive behavior analysis, heuristic detection, and machine learning techniques. DMDA follows a multi-layered architectural framework from which features are extracted using API calls, memory usage, and network activity within a sandboxed environment. It uses advanced feature extraction techniques in conjunction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to rank features relevant for classification. By integrating them into the Random Forest algorithm, Deep Neural Networks enhance the capability of the system in making the correct distinction between benign and malware activities. The effects of the different features on outcomes in detection can be understood by the application of XAI methodologies including LIME and SHAP. DMDA learns knowledge of new emerging malware variants through continuous learning processes and reinforcement learning to adaptively improve the efficiency in detection. The proposed algorithm showed 98.8% detection accuracy, reducing false positives without losing computational efficiency. In fact, this makes DMDA scalable and robust for real-time malware detection in a sandbox environment. The future work will include cloud integration and applications in IoT security. Underlined is the relevance of creative methodologies in detection, as threats keep on evolving with overall cybersecurity resilience."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Cascading failures can dismantle critical infrastructures long before individual components reach their design limits. Yet quantifying the lifetime of such cascades remains difficult because breakdown probability depends simultaneously on network scale, load statistics and external disturbances. Through large-scale Monte-Carlo simulations on two-dimensional lattices covering four orders of magnitude in size, we show that the reciprocal lifetime collapses onto a single master curve when plotted against a dimensionless amplification factor that combines network size with the redistributed load per failure. This scaling law holds for five qualitatively different initial-load distributions—uniform, lognormal, gamma, power-law and Gaussian—thus defining a distribution-independent indicator of network robustness. A mean-field cascade map provides an analytic explanation and yields a closed safety bound that prevents the cascade from ever crossing the site-percolation threshold. The bound also shows that uniform disturbances translate the entire master curve horizontally, enabling accelerated lifetime qualification of large networks via small surrogates. These findings convert numerical evidence into actionable design rules and demonstrate how a seemingly complex phenomenon reduces to two control parameters: the amplification factor and the disturbance margin, together guaranteeing immunity against complete lifetime collapse."

Positive rules help pinpoint modules that require thorough testing due to a higher likelihood of defects, whereas negative rules help avoid unnecessary testing by identifying likely clean modules. However, a critical question arises when both positive and negative conditions co-occur: what happens in such cases ̶ does the module end up being buggy or not (\"A&B⇒buggy or not buggy\")? This study investigates the combined effects of positive and negative conditions to determine which set of conditions dominates in predicting software defects. We conduct experiments using defect datasets from versions 2.0 and 3.0 of the Eclipse Mylyn project, which are widely used benchmarks in software defect prediction research. Our results show that dominant conditions for buggy (or not-buggy) modules are primarily associated with process metrics such as added lines, deleted lines, and pre-release defects, while product metrics showed very limited influence."

To address this conflict, we introduce an adaptive weighting mechanism that integrates the Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) algorithm with a Leader-Follower formation control model, termed ORCA-LF. This method effectively balances the safety of obstacle avoidance with the stability of formation control. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that in obstacle-free environments, the proposed method guarantees asymptotic convergence of formation errors, while in environments with obstacles, it ensures formation errors remain bounded. Simulation results verify that ORCA-LF, while maintaining distributed control characteristics, effectively balances the demands of collision avoidance safety and formation stability. It demonstrates robustness and practical applicability across various scenarios, including open spaces, dynamic obstacle regions, and narrow passages, thus providing a solid theoretical foundation and technical support for deploying ground-based multi-agent systems in real-world engineering applications."

In recent work, using experimentally validated kinetic particle-in-cell Monte Carlo collisional simulations [1], [2], we reported the sheath electric field reversal in low pressure CCPs, driven by a radio-frequency voltage source, when the driving voltage amplitude is up to 1000 V [3]. Due to the symmetry in geometrically symmetric single-frequency driven CCPs, the field reversal appears within each sheath adjacent to each electrode. In this work, we demonstrate the presence of field reversals in CCPs driven by tailored voltage waveforms. For a CCP with one electrode grounded and another electrode powered by a peaked or valley-type waveforms composed of 13.56 MHz sinusoidal waveform and its harmonics, a strong reversed sheath field is found only in one sheath that has the prominent sheath collapse phase shift. However, when the capacitive discharge is driven by a high frequency (60 MHz) voltage source on one electrode and a very low frequency (0.6 MHz) composed peak-type waveform on another electrode, multiple strong field reversals are found when the sheath collapses near the low frequency source driven electrode, a few weak field reversals are observed near the high frequency source-driven electrode due to secondary electron emission. In addition, the effect of a reversed sheath field on the electron/ion energy distribution incident on the electrodes will also be discussed in detail."

Conventional OCR methods do not work well on contents which comprise of text along with mathematical expressions. This paper proposes an automated book scanning system comprising of Raspberry Pi, page gripper and flipper set up and a smartphone camera for capturing the content. Once the content is captured, a combination of text recognition, mathematical expression detection and recognition modules work in synergy to provide the final digitized content. The mathematical expression detection module consists of a customized RoIHeads version of Faster R-CNN. The proposed model performed with 95.71% precision, 91.77% recall, 93.74% F1-score, and 87.42% mean IOU on the publicly available IBEM dataset. Once the expressions are detected, they are recognised using the Vision Encoder-Decoder Model architecture and the subsequent latex version of the mathematical expression is generated. This model is trained on the Im2Latex dataset and provided a BLEU score of 86.44 % on the test set. We also demonstrated the utility of the proposed method in academic STEM book scanning with accurate recovery of mathematical expressions. Our system gives a cost effective solution which makes it possible to extract text and mathematical content from printed books in a method that is scalable and accurate. This opens the door to large-scale digital preservation and machine-readable academic archiving."

    "abstract": "The automatic generation of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams from natural language requirements continues to be a difficult task in software engineering education and practice. Conventional rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches often fail to handle semantic ambiguity and typically demand extensive manual adjustments. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate stronger contextual reasoning abilities, but their capability to produce accurate and structured diagrams-particularly in instructional settings—has not been thoroughly examined. This work compares a traditional NLP pipeline with a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct model using a dataset of 75 annotated specifications. The fine-tuned model attained a semantic fidelity of 94%, a G-Eval correctness score of 0.78, and reduced manual correction requirements by 78%. In contrast, the NLP pipeline achieved 67% fidelity and required a 52% correction effort. Statistical analysis using MANOVA and ANOVA confirmed that these differences across the student, NLP, and LLM groups were statistically significant (p < 0.001). Moreover, students working with LLM-generated diagrams reported a 30% decrease in effort and greater engagement during modeling tasks. The findings demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs can substantially improve the precision and interpretability of automated UML diagram generation while supporting more interactive and effective learning in software engineering contexts."

    "abstract": "All-digital True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) play a crucial role in enhancing hardware security by providing native entropy sources directly within the processor pipeline. Their integration into open architectures such as RISC-V enables the extension of the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) with secure, hardware-level random number generation capabilities essential for cryptographic operations. This work presents the design and validation of an all-digital True Random Number Generator (TRNG) for seamless integration with RISC-V processors via a custom interface. The proposed circuit has been developed using SystemVerilog and leverages Fibonacci Galois Ring Oscillators (FiGaROs), which use jitter and metastability as entropy sources to ensure high quality randomness. The TRNG has been integrated with the VECtor processor (VEC) core of the European Processor ACcelerator (EPAC) chip through a custom Control and Status Register (CSR) interface, enabling its use as a secure entropy source within the RISC-V instruction set architecture for cryptographic applications. The validation campaign is based on the typical main statistical suites of reference organizations in the field of security and cryptography and demonstrates that our solution offers both high-security standards and independence from both the implementation technology and the operating frequency chosen for the TRNG circuit, reporting an entropy per bit (in terms of Shannon entropy) of 0.9999 in all test cases, while always passing the pass-fail criteria for randomness. In addition, our circuit offers the highest entropy rate for both Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) solutions, as well as an efficiency in terms of entropy rate per resource consumption that is approximately 96 to 257 times that of the other solutions in the case of ASIC implementation."

The DPF consists of two coaxial electrodes, which generate a plasma sheath by ionizing deuterium gas. The sheath implodes on the axis in a z-pinch geometry. When the pinch breaks apart, it produces a beam of ions that impacts the “target”, a region of the sheath assembled on axis past the pinch. The “beam-target” interaction produces a neutron burst lasting on the order of tens of nanoseconds, which can be used for radiography. We characterize the DPF implosion with laser interferometry, visible self-emission imaging, photodiode detectors, activation detectors, neutron time-of-flight detectors, and neutron radiography. The high shot rate and large suite of diagnostics make MJOLNIR uniquely suited to serving as a user facility for materials testing, diagnostic and detector testing and development, and longer-time-scale laboratory astrophysics platforms. As a new member of ZNetUS, MJOLNIR is an ideal platform for scaling up universityscale experiments. This presentation will lay out the opportunities available at the MJOLNIR facility as a test bed and neutron source."

    "abstract": "Ecological restoration increasingly requires decision-support frameworks that can integrate diverse remote sensing indicators while maintaining interpretability for practical planning. Existing approaches often emphasize ecosystem assessment but provide limited guidance for selecting specific restoration projects, due to indicator redundancy and opacity of black-box deep learning models. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a weakly interpretable machine learning framework that combines principal component analysis (PCA) with k-nearest neighbors (KNN), termed PCA-KNN, for ecological restoration engineering planning. PCA fuses multi-source ecological indicators into principal components while retaining transparent loadings linked to underlying ecological processes, and KNN provides sample-based classification with traceable decision logic. Together, this structure allows ecological indicators and engineering decisions to be explicitly connected, balancing predictive performance with practical interpretability. The framework is applied to the northern slope of the Qinling Mountains, China, an ecologically significant region facing soil erosion, vegetation degradation, land-use conflict, and wetland decline. Using 13 kinds of remote sensing-derived indicators and field-verified engineering labels, the method achieves 87.6% block-level accuracy and 66.8% pixel-level accuracy, effectively mapping four restoration engineering types and reducing the planning cycle by more than half. Results demonstrate that the proposed PCA-KNN framework translates remote sensing ecological indicators into actionable engineering decisions, offering an operational and scalable pathway for data-driven restoration planning. This work advances remote sensing-based ecological restoration from post-hoc evaluation toward transparent, engineering-oriented planning support."

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for improving the generalization of of AI models used in mammogram screening, as unknown distribution shifts in external datasets can degrade performance. Identifying OOD samples helps maintain strong model performance across internal external datasets. Given the challenge of limited prior knowledge about OOD samples in external datasets, unsupervised generative learning is a preferable solution which trains the model to discern the normal characteristics of in-distribution (ID) data. Generic hypothesis is that during inference, the model aims to reconstruct ID samples accurately, while OOD samples exhibit poorer reconstruction due to their divergence from normality. Inspired by the hybrid architectures combining CNNs and trans formers, we developed a novel backbone- HAND, for detecting OOD from large-scale digital screening mammogram studies. However, relying solely on reconstruction error is insufficient for reliable OOD detection, as it may not consistently distinguish between ID and OOD samples. To address this, we incorporated synthetic OOD samples and a parallel discriminator in the latent space to distinguish between ID and OOD samples. Additionally, we applied gradient reversal to the OOD reconstruction loss, effectively discouraging the model from accurately reconstructing OODinputs and reinforcing its ability to differentiate them from ID samples. An anomaly score is computed by weighting the reconstruction and discriminator loss. On internal RSNA mammogram held-out test and external Mayo clinic hand-curated dataset, the proposed HAND model outperformed encoder-based and GAN-based baselines, and interestingly, it also outperformed the hybrid CNN+transformer baselines. Therefore, the proposed HAND pipeline offers an automated efficient computational solution for domain-specific quality checks in external screening mammograms, yielding actionable insights without direct expo sure to the private medical imaging data."

    "abstract": "Event reasoning is to reason with events and certain inter-event relations. These cutting-edge techniques possess crucial and fundamental capabilities that underlie various applications. Large language models (LLMs) have made advances in event reasoning owing to their wealth of training. However, the LLMs commonly used today still do not consistently demonstrate proficiency in managing event reasoning as humans. This discrepancy arises from not explicitly modeling events and their relations and insufficient knowledge of event relations. In addition, the different reasoning paradigms of the LLMs are trained in an imbalanced way. In this paper, we propose WIZARDEVENT, to synthesize data from the unlabeled corpus with the proposed hybrid event-aware instruction tuning. Specifically, we first represent the events and their relation in a novel structure and then extract the knowledge from the raw text. Second, we introduce hybrid event reasoning paradigms with four reasoning formats. Lastly, we wrap our constructed WIZARDEVENT with the paradigms to create the instruction tuning dataset. We fine-tune the model with this enriched dataset, significantly improving the event reasoning. The performance of WIZARDEVENT is rigorously evaluated through extensive experiments. The results demonstrate that WIZARDEVENT substantially outperforms baselines, indicating the effectiveness of our approach."

Therefore, based on statistical theory and a thorough investigation of cell degradation mechanisms and models, the statistical degradation models of packs for any configurations are pioneeringly developed through theoretical derivation. These models consider cell-to-cell variations, apply to various lithium-ion battery types and operating conditions, and are verified through Monte Carlo simulation. Based on these models, the pack state-of-health (SOH) statistics can be quickly and accurately obtained to quantify their degradation characteristics. Furthermore, the pack reliability can be efficiently assessed by integrating these models with the universal generating function (UGF) method. The results demonstrate that both parallel and series configurations enhance the pack-level SOH consistency. The SOH consistency in parallel modules with four cells is improved by 50% over cell-to-cell. After 3,000 cycles, a 10°C temperature variation caused pack reliability to decrease from 0.9343 to 0 (the lower the reliability, the greater the probability of failure occurring in a batch of packs). Moreover, packs with cells firstly connected in parallel and then in series exhibit superior SOH statistical performance and reliability. It has significant applications in pack configuration optimization, cell screening, and echelon utilization of retired packs."

However, the impact of such fluid motion on alpha particle transport and the underlying physics has not been fully explored in previous studies. In our work, we deduce a novel analytical expression for the charged-particle stopping power in moving plasmas. Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations indicate that incorporating the background fluid velocity into the modeling of alpha particle transport within hotspot plasmas results in more energy being directly transferred to the D and T ions, while the background electrons receive less energy from the alpha particles. These findings enhance the understanding of how the burning hotspot quenches after bangtime and enable more accurate predictions in the pursuit of high energy yields."

Such copyrighted data may include general information (e.g., historical knowledge, or common sense), necessitating that LLMs generate content preserving key information rather than exact replicas. Current unlearning methods, however, primarily aim to fully forget targeted knowledge or key information, potentially leading to hallucinations of general information. To address these challenges, we propose an unlearning method based on attention flattening in auto-regressive models, combined with simulation tasks for targeted information forgetting. During optimization, the model is trained only on real tasks while acquiring knowledge from simulation task learning to suppress the memorization of copyrighted data. In inference, we compare the sensitivity of attention heads between simulation and real tasks, identify those most relevant to copyrighted data, and perform attention head pruning to suppress the generation of such data. Experimental results show that our method achieves lower perplexity and BLEU scores while maintaining higher entity coverage scores compared to existing unlearning baselines in generation tasks on copyrighted general information."

    "abstract": "As corporate social responsibility (CSR) gains increasing prominence in e-commerce, platforms are increasingly providing sales assistance to support their suppliers, such as JD's consumer-to-manufacturer initiatives, which help suppliers reduce their direct selling cost. However, the interplay between such sales assistance and the platform's CSR commitments remains poorly understood. While assistance can lower suppliers' operational cost, it may also reduce their profits in reselling channels, complicating the overall welfare implications. To systematically examine this interplay, we develop a game-theoretic model in which a CSR-oriented platform decides whether and how to assist a supplier, who subsequently chooses a distribution channel. Our results show that sales assistance benefits both parties only when the assistance is highly efficient and the commission rate is moderate. Otherwise, even well-intentioned assistance can harm the supplier due to high commission fees. Moreover, even if a platform with a high CSR level (i.e., one that pays more attention to suppliers' profits in addition to its own) exerts more assistance effort, a high commission rate can squeeze more profit, making sales assistance harmful to the supplier. Therefore, our study not only enriches the existing literature on channel structures by combining CSR and sales assistance but also provides valuable managerial insights. Specifically, it highlights that simply providing sales assistance is insufficient as it is necessary to simultaneously reduce commission fees for platform managers to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Managerial relevance statement:</i> This research provides crucial strategic guidance for engineering managers and policy makers navigating platform-driven supply chains. For engineering managers responsible for designing operational assistance systems, such as logistics optimization tools, supplier training modules, or data analytics platforms, our findings demonstrate that technical efficiency alone is insufficient. To create sustainable impact, these systems must be coupled with moderate commission structures and a nuanced understanding of channel selection dynamics. Specifically, managers should evaluate how assistance efficiency interacts with commission rates across different channel structures to avoid unintended consequences where platform support inadvertently diminishes supplier profitability. For policymakers and platform strategists, this study reveals that corporate social responsibility initiatives require careful calibration between operational support and financial pressures. Regulatory frameworks and platform governance models should encourage transparent pricing structures and balanced risk-sharing mechanisms. Wellintentioned assistance programs can inadvertently harm supplier viability when implementation overlooks these economic realities. Policy interventions could include establishing guidelines for fair commission practices or creating certification standards for effective supplier development programs. This paper also contributes to the following SDGs: SDG 8, SDG 9, SDG 12."

At these amplitudes, attenuation of the electromagnetic wave is necessary to prevent damage to the measuring instruments. This is achieved by operating the waveguide antenna below its cut-off frequency where the electromagnetic wave becomes an evanescent mode and undergoes tunneling. The amplitude of the signal can be attenuated by an arbitrary amount by varying the waveguide's geometry. As the attenuation increases approximately exponentially with decreasing frequency below the cut-off, any deviations in the measured electromagnetic wave from 2.5 GHz can be easily accounted for. Although waveguides operating below cut-off have been used for a long time, to our knowledge, there is no complete description of them in the literature."

To maintain process consistency and ensure efficient equipment operation, it is essential to effectively control charge accumulation on the substrate surface. In continuous wave (CW) electronegative plasmas, the energy of negative ions is significantly lower than the sheath potential, confining them within the plasma due to the electrostatic field and preventing them from reaching the substrate.

Compared to CW ICP, pulse power modulation resulted in a substantially higher flux of negative ions. Additionally, during the afterglow phase, the ambipolar field collapses, resulting in an increased flux of negative ions reaching the substrate. These results therefor provide valuable insights for optimizing etching process conditions in the sub-10 nm regime."

In a pulsed power system this insulator stack must hold off a large voltage pulse for at least the beginning part of the pulse, as power is delivered to a downstream target. Often, the size of the insulator stack to achieve robust performance is a limiting factor in the facility size. It is extremely advantageous, and sometimes necessary, to achieve reductions in size while maintaining a robust performance."

Leveraging energy harvesting technology, this paper considers an energy constrained source node that harvests energy from a power source through passive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces. The harvested energy is then utilized to serve multiple downlink power domain non-orthogonal multiple access users with the aid of partitioned active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface. Partitioned active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface as well as power domain non-orthogonal multiple access users are assumed to be impaired by impulsive noise. Hardware impairments are also accounted for at the source node and the power domain non-orthogonal multiple access users. It is shown that the impact of impulsive noise is negligible for imperfect successive interference cancellation at the power domain non-orthogonal multiple access users. However, for perfect successive interference cancellation, impulsive noise at the partitioned active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface degrades performance more severely for the nearest user than the farthest."

    "abstract": "Estimating the normal of a point requires constructing a local patch to provide center-surrounding context, but determining the appropriate neighborhood size is difficult when dealing with different data or geometries. Existing methods commonly employ various parameter-heavy strategies to extract a full feature description from the input patch. However, they still have difficulties in accurately and efficiently predicting normals for various point clouds. In this work, we present a new idea of feature extraction for robust normal estimation of point clouds. We use the fusion of multi-scale features from different neighborhood sizes to address the issue of selecting reasonable patch sizes for various data or geometries. We seek to model a patch feature fitting (PFF) based on multi-scale features to approximate the optimal geometric description for normal estimation and implement the approximation process via multi-scale feature aggregation and cross-scale feature compensation. The feature aggregation module progressively aggregates the patch features of different scales to the center of the patch and shrinks the patch size by removing points far from the center. It not only enables the network to precisely capture the structure characteristic in a wide range, but also describes highly detailed geometries. The feature compensation module ensures the reusability of features from earlier layers of large scales and reveals associated information in different patch sizes. Our approximation strategy based on aggregating the features of multiple scales enables the model to achieve scale adaptation of varying local patches and deliver the optimal feature description. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with fewer network parameters and running time."

A set of experiments were carried out at the French-German Research Institute ISL involving the railgun experimental facility NGL-60, featuring convex rails and a 60 mm caliber, aimed at comparing different pulse shaping strategies and evaluating their effect on the launch efficiency. To this end, different initial capacitive energies with masses ranging between grams and kilograms have been tested. The results are analyzed by evaluating the different evolutions of energy quantities during the conversion process.

    "abstract": "Z-pinch is an efficient technique for generating intense pulsed soft X-rays and has demonstrated significant potential for nuclear fusion energy applications. However, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities during the implosion process often degrade implosion quality and reduce radiation yield. This study investigates the dynamic evolution of pulsed axial magnetic fields in Zpinch and their critical role in stabilizing the implosion process. To achieve three-dimensional control over the axial magnetic field distribution, an optimized rotating return column model is developed, incorporating the interplay of electric, magnetic, and mechanical fields. High spatiotemporal resolution optical diagnostics capture the diffusion and freezing processes of the axial magnetic field. Plasma parameters diagnostics and magnetic shear analysis further reveal the underlying stabilization mechanisms.To address axial field non-uniformities, a comprehensive magnetization structure composed of a magnetic mirror and a rotating return column is proposed. This design mitigates the suppressive effect of the return current structure on axial field diffusion at the load ends, enhancing axial field strength while improving uniformity. Results indicate that, for a fixed load height, the additional inductance of the rotating return column is correlated with the number of turns. Increasing the number of turns enhances the axial field but also extends the current rise time. For single-wire loads, increasing the turns from 0.75 to 1.25 expands the implosion radius by 25 %, delays stagnation time by 13 %, and reduces instability amplitudes by up to 40 %. In wire array loads, optical diagnostics reveal that the axial field migrates with the ablation flow, compresses along the axis, and effectively suppresses axial non-uniformities and magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor (MRT) instabilities.These findings provide new insights into optimizing magnetic field control to enhance Z-pinch implosion stability."

SOZ localization largely depends on biomarkers such as interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) and high frequency oscillations (HFOs), though often they are found in both SOZ and non-SOZ areas, causing limited specificity. This study investigates whether temporally co-occurring biomarkers offer better SOZ identification. We analyzed intracranial electrode recordings from 10 DRE patients, evaluating three co-occurrence features: HFO-IED, HFO-HFO, and IED-IED overlaps. Statistical and machine learning analyses confirmed that co-occurrence features have significant difference in distribution within SOZ and non-SOZ region. IED-IED overlap demonstrated robustness in machine learning based classification, achieving the highest accuracy (71.65%), sensitivity (74.08%) and F1 score (0.6727); outperforming both traditional and overlap biomarkers. HFO-IED overlap showed the highest classification specificity (78.81%). These findings highlight the added value of temporal cooccurrence patterns, in enhancing presurgical evaluations for epilepsy treatment."

This paper systematically reviews advancements in deep learningdriven fault diagnosis for motors under information missing conditions over the past decade. A brief introduction to the motor system is given first to dissecting the typical types of failures and their corresponding root causes from the motor system level to the component level. Next, data reconstruction methods and hidden space inference strategies to reconstruct missing data are investigated. Further, deep learning methods for label-missing scenarios are reviewed, focusing on semi-supervised, weakly supervised, and self-supervised learning frameworks. Finally, focusing on information missing scenarios, this paper summarizes the core technical challenges facing this research area and provides potential avenues for future development."

We used a traffic condition image dataset comprising five categories of traffic density (empty, low, moderate, high, and traffic jam) to assess the performance of different deep learning models: YOLOv8l, YOLOv9c, YOLOv10n, Sequential, ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152, InceptionV3, VGG16, and VGG19. YOLOv10n demonstrated superior performance, offering rapid inference and high accuracy in vehicle detection. VGG16 also proved to be a viable model, exhibiting low latency, short processing times, and strong classification accuracy across traffic density categories. Despite achieving high prediction scores, the sequential and InceptionV3 models overestimated traffic density, indicating limitations in their generalization capabilities. The results provide a basis for future research and practical applications in intelligent traffic monitoring systems."

    "abstract": "Consistent video depth estimation aims to predict temporally consistent depth maps for videos. Various techniques have been developed to utilize temporal correlations between frames; however, most of these techniques generalize poorly to unconstrained scenes. Some recent methods based on testtime training require an impractical amount of inference time. Other methods apply attention mechanisms to video features to accomplish temporal consistency, but they do not consider scene variations across frames. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called flow-guided consistent video depth estimator (FCVD), in which a spatial feature alignment process leverages optical flow to modulate scene variations. Zero-shot cross-dataset evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed FCVD algorithm outperforms existing techniques in terms of depth accuracy and temporal consistency."

    "abstract": "Toxic content on online platforms—such as hate speech, harassment, and discrimination—continues to threaten the safety and inclusivity of digital spaces. These harmful interactions negatively impact user experience and highlight the need for automated, reliable moderation tools. In this study, we present a robust and interpretable machine learning framework for toxic comment classification using a fine-tuned BERT model. To enhance transparency, we integrate SHAP-based explanations that highlight which words contribute to a classification. To improve robustness, we incorporate adversarial training with obfuscated toxic samples (e.g., misspellings or symbol substitutions) that mimic real-world evasion tactics. Additionally, we implement a rule-based filter to flag borderline cases—especially those involving ambiguous terms—for manual review, reducing false positives. A user-friendly Streamlit interface allows real-time interaction with the model, providing both predictions and visual explanations. Experiments on the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification datasets show that our approach outperforms standard baselines in accuracy, interpretability, and resilience to adversarial input."

    "abstract": "We present an iterative beamforming framework that combines minimum-variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming with power spectral density (PSD) estimation in beamspace. This framework leverages the sparsity of speech in the time-frequency (TF) domain to improve the performance of MVDR beamforming for underdetermined sound source separation. Initially, PSD of interferences are estimated in beamspace using multiple fixed beamformers. These estimates are used to compute MVDR weights for each TF bin, attenuating the dominant interferers in each bin. In each iteration, the enhanced spatial selectivity of the MVDR outputs refines the interference PSD estimates, which in turn improve the subsequent weight computations. This iterative process preserves the distortionless response of MVDR beamforming while eliminating the need for nonlinear post-filtering and its associated artefacts. Simulations and real-world experiments conducted across diverse acoustic environments demonstrate substantial improvements in signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) compared to conventional MVDR. Notably, under anechoic conditions, the proposed method approaches the SIR improvement of a time-frequency MVDR beamformer constructed with oracle source PSD."

Various numerical simulation techniques are utilized to analyze and optimize plasma behavior, each offering distinct advantages and limitations. This study compares three simulation approaches: the Global Model, COMSOL Multi-physics, and the Particle-in-Cell (PIC) Monte Carlo Collision (MCC) method for ICP systems. The Global Model assumes a spatially uniform plasma and efficiently predicts averaged plasma parameters as functions of external control variables such as input power, pressure, and gas flow [1]. COMSOL Multi-physics, a fluid-based finite element method (FEM) solver, enables the self-consistent modeling of electromagnetic fields, fluid dynamics, and chemical reactions, providing insights into multi-physics interactions within ICP systems [2]. Based on the PIC-MCC method, the K-PIC code tracks individual particle motions, offering detailed microscopic insights into sheath formation, power transfer, and kinetic effects [3]. This study investigates key plasma parameters under various operating conditions, including electron density, electron energy distribution function (EEDF), power absorption efficiency, and plasma uniformity. The trade-offs between computational cost and the accuracy level provided by each model are assessed, leading to a strategic selection framework for determining the most suitable simulation methodology. The findings of this study provide valuable guidelines for designing and optimizing ICP systems."

    "abstract": "Measuring current is critical to safe and effective pulsed power applications for in vivo medicine such as electrochemotherapy, pulsed field ablation (PFA) or endoscopic pulsed plasma treatment. Monitoring current not only allows the correct dose to be delivered to the target, but it also serves as a diagnostic tool for assessing the treatment outcome by indirectly providing the target impedance. In vivo applications usually involve catheters or electrodes, whose transmission-line effect can no longer be neglected when the applied pulses are very short, e.g., below 50 ns. In this case, the current becomes position-dependent, further complexifying measurement tasks. With this work, we propose a remote current measurement method based on voltage reflectometry. By analyzing voltage reflections from an arbitrary complex load, it has been shown possible to accurately assess the total current flowing through the load with no additional devices between the generator and the load. This work was achieved using an optoelectronic pulse forming network (PFN) generator featuring two photoconductive semiconductor switches (PCSS) [1]. Due to its special topology, the generator was simultaneously utilized as a voltage reflectometer. The generated pulses had a duration ranging from 10 ns to 40 ns with an amplitude up to 15 kV. The feasibility of the method was demonstrated using a nanosecond atmospheric pressure plasma jet (ns-APPJ) system [2]. The ns-APPJ system provided a configurable complex load that allowed validating the method over a wide impedance range. Furthermore, the electrical effects of the ns- APPJ system were assessed by performing a SOL (Short, Open, Load) calibration. The SOL calibration allowed separating the current due to the plasma discharges from the total current measured at the input of the device."

To address this, we propose a novel Digital Twin-based Closed-Loop Feedback Overtaking Decision Optimization Framework specifically designed for the overtaking maneuver. This framework leverages a Digital Twin (DT) to perform continuous model optimization and refinement, providing updated decisionmaking models to a physical twin for real-time execution. To mitigate performance degradation due to large data volumes, the framework incorporates both macro- and micro-level overtaking adjustment mechanisms coupled with incremental learning. Furthermore, we introduce a Boltzmann strategy-enhanced Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to improve the efficiency of lanechanging and overtaking strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively enhances overtaking decision-making efficiency and optimizes performance in complex traffic scenarios."

The capacitors are based on a previously developed low equivalent series inductance (ESL) winding geometry, ensuring minimal inductive contribution during high-current pulses. By pre-soaking the separator before winding the element, uniform polymer distribution is achieved within large winding geometries. The resulting samples exhibit stable capacitance behavior compared to classical HV-electrolyte capacitors and a factor of ten ESR reduction at 100 kHz. The proposed process enables improved high-frequency performance and offers a promising route for low-loss AECs in future highpower, fast-pulse systems."

The results were compared and analyzed from the four perspectives of (1) learning objects, (2) support design, (3) forms of practice, and (4) learning outcome measures. As a result, the following research gaps were identified: (1) lack of validation for students with significant academic achievement polarization, (2) lack of Large Language Models (LLM) tutor practice in Japanese and high school mathematics, (3) delay in developing indices to measure deep conceptual understanding and metacognition, and (4) lack of demonstration of cooperative operation models between teachers and AI. In particular, the fact that the average score of Mathematics IA (Math IA) in the common test fluctuates ±20 points from year to year and has an amplitude 3 to 5 times that of other subjects supports the urgent need for AI-based individualized optimization support. Based on the above, we plan to introduce the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4)-based \"Khanmigo-like AI tutor\" into Japanese high school mathematics classes and conduct a practical study to verify its effectiveness in deepening understanding and motivating learning for different achievement levels. We hope that this research will serve as a basic reference for designing mathematics education and generating evidence in the age of LLMs."

These issues lead to labor-intensive efforts with limited effectiveness. To address this, we propose a Objectives-Driven Assurance Methodology for GQC engineering. Departing from current process-oriented paradigms, our approach prioritizes the systematic mitigation of risks inherent in achieving top-level GQC objective. The method establishes a multi-level GQC objectives decomposition structure, which enables the hierarchical decomposition of toplevel GQC objective into measurable, traceable requirements at the subsystem, equipment, software, and hardware levels. Combining this decomposition structure with a dedicated assurance framework and risk-informed verification methods ensures that objectives remain valid throughout the development lifecycle and that expectations are met with acceptable residual risk. This integrated methodology provides effective management of critical functions and components, delivering quantifiable, traceable GQC design outcomes. The proposed approach demonstrably enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of GQC design and analysis, offering a viable solution to the critical need for flexible, outcome-focused development paradigms in next-generation airborne systems."

Renewable energy sources (RES) such as photovoltaic have become particularly popular. However, RES requires a new approach to manage energy demand and supply by leveraging distributed energy generation. In this context, a useful paradigm is a peer-to-peer (P2P) energy marketplace, which is a trading mechanism that actively involves consumers and prosumers in trading electricity using state-of-the-art information and communication technologies. Accordingly, we focus on optimizing total energy trading costs by using quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) to ensure that local generation is first consumed by energy consumers within a local community. This is followed by a proposal of blockchain-based energy trading systems to facilitate decentralized, secured, and privacy-protected trading platforms for the trading participants. To this end, we use three optimization techniques - linear optimization techniques, reinforcement learning, and QRL - and analyze their performance. Simulation results show that the agents learning using quantum computing converge faster than those of the other two optimization techniques."

The proposed method integrates the encoder of the ASR model with the decoder of the LLMs, enabling simultaneous transcription and censorship tasks to prevent the exposure of harmful content. Instruction tuning of the LLM to mask hate-related words with specific tokens requires an annotated hate speech dataset, which is limited. We generate text samples using an LLM with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique guided by cultural context and examples and then convert them into speech samples using a text-to-speech (TTS) system. However, some of them contain non-hate speech samples with hate-related words, which degrades the censorship performance. This paper filters the samples which text classification models correctly label as hate content. By adjusting the threshold for the number of correct answer models, we can control the level of hate in the generated dataset, allowing us to train the LLMs through curriculum learning in a gradual manner. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a masking accuracy of 58.6% for hate-related words, surpassing previous baselines. We also confirm that the curriculum training contributes to the efficiency of both transcription and censorship tasks. This paper includes offensive or hateful contents but does not refer to any particular group or individual."

The English Twitter dataset was obtained from publicly available online sources, while the mixed-language dataset was independently collected and manually annotated with sentiment labels. Both datasets underwent preprocessing to ensure compatibility with the input requirements of the respective models. Model performance was evaluated through the comparative analysis of sentiment prediction accuracy across the two datasets. Results indicate that the LSTM model outperformed the XLM-R model on the English dataset, demonstrating reliable sentiment classification capabilities. However, both models exhibited diminished performance when applied to the Malay-English mixed-language dataset, highlighting the challenges posed by code-mixed text in sentiment analysis."

On the dataset of pretrained models, we compared models trained in two languages (Japanese and Chinese) and models trained only in Japanese. Regarding the quality of the synthesized speech, we confirmed that the model trained only in Japanese has higher naturalness than the model trained in Japanese and Chinese in both subjective and objective evaluation experiments, and that the input text is accurately synthesized. We also examined the emotional features used in speech synthesis and confirmed that the average of the emotional features of other speakers, other than the speaker to be synthesized, yields a higher emotion recognition rate than the average of the emotional features extracted from the target speech or the average of the emotional features of the speech of the speaker to be synthesized. Furthermore, it was found that even in mixed emotion speech synthesis, in which two types of emotions are mixed, the emotion recognized by the subject changes consistently depending on the mixing ratio, and it was found that emotions close to human sensation are possible."

The model, trained on the condition of particular attributes (product category, customer demographics, and purchase behavior) produces realistic, but anonymized datasets that have the statistical characteristics of the real e-commerce data. This synthetic data can be used as a privacy-preserving substitute of training and testing machine learning models within areas of customer segmentation, fraud detection, and recommendation systems.

    "abstract": "Driven by the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in healthcare, Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG), which represent dynamic relationships among medical entities over time, have emerged as a vital foundation for tasks such as disease progression forecasting and the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) principle of \"preventive treatment.\" However, most existing TKG reasoning methods rely heavily on historical interactions or recurring patterns, limiting their ability to accurately predict medical events with limited historical records. To address this limitation, we propose a model called ECLTKG (Enhanced Contrastive Learning for Temporal Knowledge Graph), which is an Enhanced Contrastive Learning framework designed to jointly model both historical and non-historical dependencies. The framework introduces an adaptive loss weighting strategy to improve training stability and integrates a progressive thresholding mechanism with a mask-based inference module to effectively prioritize critical candidate entities. These innovations collectively enhance the model’s generalization capability in sparse clinical environments. We validate ECLTKG on a self-constructed temporal dataset derived from real-world clinical records of gastritis patients. Experimental results demonstrate that ECLTKG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, offering robust support for disease risk assessment and the practical implementation of preventive healthcare in TCM."

As financial debt and illiteracy rise across Canada, especially among Generation Z, there is a growing need for intelligent and accessible financial guidance. To address this, we synthesize a realistic dataset of 100 simulated Canadian users, we model financial behaviour using demographics, savings, debt, and expense data. Our system integrates multiple components: Isolation Forest for anomaly detection, ARIMA and LSTM for expense forecasting and a rule-based recommendation system (RecSys) to generate personalized financial advice. These elements form a unified pipeline that identifies abnormal spending, forecasts future expenses and delivers risk-aligned recommendations. Experimental results show that our hybrid forecasting model effectively predicts future financial behaviour, while the recommendation engine generates user-specific plans with heuristic scoring for priority labelling. Although this paper uses synthetic data and a rule-based RecSys, it provides proof of concept for scalable, practical applications. Future work includes real-user testing, dynamic LLM integration with an API key, and full-stack deployment."

Previously, a decentralized IVA algorithm based on the natural gradient method was proposed for image signals. Unlike conventional BSS approaches, which aggregate all observations at a central processing unit, the decentralized IVA utilizes signals only within small groups of nearby microphones, referred to as subarrays, and shares not the signals themselves, but their power information among subarrays. In this paper, we first formulate the optimization problem of decentralized IVA for audio signals captured by distributed microphone arrays. We then derive a decentralized IVA algorithm as a modified version of auxiliary-function-based IVA to improve the convergence speed and stability of the conventional decentralized IVA. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm converges faster and more stably than the natural gradient-based approach and achieves better performance than centralized IVA."

Testing for integration was conducted to verify the interoperability of sensors with other system components. System-level testing was performed to assess the end-to-end functionality of the entire solution, ensuring that all subsystems operated cohesively. Acceptance testing was performed on-site to validate the deployment and operational readiness of the solution under real-world conditions.

Using real-time data from the Gumi Industrial Complex, the system establishes a dynamic link between physical operations and their digital counterparts, enabling continuous monitoring and intelligent decision-making. At its core, the framework employs a hybrid deep learning architecture that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) layers. This architecture is specifically designed to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in energy consumption data, improving the accuracy of predictive modeling. The DT component simulates alternative operational scenarios in real time, identifying configurations that reduce energy usage without compromising production efficiency. XAI techniques are embedded to make the system's recommendations transparent and interpretable, fostering trust and usability for operators. Evaluation results show that Energy-Twin achieves a high prediction accuracy of 99.55% with low computational overhead, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. The proposed approach offers a practical pathway to energy-efficient and intelligent manufacturing under the Industry 5.0 framework."

Standard tools such as electrocardiography (ECG) and troponin assays remain essential but have limitations in sensitivity and early detection. This study proposes a non-invasive approach using phonocardiogram (PCG) signals—brief cardiac acoustic recordings—to classify MI severity, guided by troponin test labels. PCG signals were captured via electronic stethoscope, transformed with Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) for feature extraction, and balanced with Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). A VGG-16 convolutional neural network was then applied to classify MI severity into four levels: micro, small, medium, and large infarctions. During internal validation, the model achieved 86 % accuracy, with 100 % sensitivity and specificity, and an F1-score of 92%. External validation yielded an F1-score of 85%, confirming generalizability. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of integrating non-invasive acoustic signals with deep learning for scalable, cost-effective, and early MI stratification."

However, collecting data from more identities is expensive, challenging, and often limited by privacy concerns. To address this limitation, we propose INSIDE (Interpolating Speaker Identities in Embedding Space), a novel data expansion method that synthesizes new speaker identities by interpolating between existing speaker embeddings. Specifically, we select pairs of nearby speaker embeddings from a pretrained speaker embedding space and compute intermediate embeddings using spherical linear interpolation. These interpolated embeddings are then fed to a text-to-speech system to generate corresponding speech waveforms. The resulting data is combined with the original dataset to train downstream models. Experiments show that models trained with INSIDEexpanded data outperform those trained only on real data, achieving 3.06 % to 5.24 % relative improvements. While INSIDE is primarily designed for speaker verification, we also validate its effectiveness on gender classification, where it yields a 13.44 % relative improvement. Moreover, INSIDE is compatible with other augmentation techniques and can serve as a flexible, scalable addition to existing training pipelines."

    "abstract": "Using appropriate psychological counseling strategies is critical for improving the quality of large language modeldriven mental health dialogues, yet a single large language model (LLM) often produces unreliable results due to ambiguous strategy definitions and degradation of thought in reasoning. Multi-LLM voting-based strategy annotation methods are often hampered in their overall decision-making performance due to the low accuracy of some individual models. To address this, we propose a multi-LLM system with a deductive-reasoning chain of thought. We built a dataset that comprises psychologist-client dialogue segments, each annotated with nine strategies by four professional psychologists. The system uses three LLMs as experts to generate initial strategy candidates, and then an LLM as a judge applies deductive reasoning-aligning dialogue evidence with strategy definitions-to annotate the optimal strategy. Experiments show that this approach outperforms single models, voting, and conventional chain-of-thought methods in F1 score and accuracy. This work advances LLM-based psychological strategy annotation, offering a reliable tool for mental health dialogue systems."

With the diversity of anomalous sounds in industrial environments and the scarcity of labeled data, unsupervised learning that leverages deep learning techniques demonstrates robust performance. However, the entire performance of the ASD detector depends significantly on the front end, which concentrates on feature extraction. While most ASD systems rely on amplitude information, there has been relatively little focus on phase information. This study proposes the use of the derivatives of instantaneous phase along time, frequency, and time-frequency, incorporating an Interpolation Deep Neural Network for ASD. The experimental procedures are conducted on the MIMII dataset, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) serving as the evaluation metric. The experimental results on the MIMII dataset demonstrate that our proposed method achieves an improvement in AUC over other recently proposed unsupervised methods that utilize amplitude information in detecting anomalous sounds from industrial machines."

    "abstract": "A feedforward active noise control (ANC) system is affected by a constraint related to processing and sound propagation delay, known as the causality constraint. To address this problem, an ANC system incorporating an optical laser microphone has been proposed. The optical laser microphone captures the vibration velocity of the target noise at the speed of light, thereby relaxing the causality constraint. However, the acquired signal contains few components related to the reverberation characteristics of the room. As a result, the noise reduction performance of the system degrades in reverberant environments. To overcome this issue, we propose a multichannel feedforward active noise control system to improve the noise reduction performance in reverberant environments. The proposed system uses both an optical laser microphone and an airconducted microphone as reference microphones. The key feature of the system is the additional air-conducted microphone, which acquires the noise with the reverberant components. The system processes signals acquired by each microphone using each noise control filter, thereby both relaxing the causality constraint and accounting for the room's reflective characteristics. As a result of actual experiments, we confirmed that the proposed system improves the noise reduction performance."

This study presents a novel approach that utilizes heterogeneous graph attention (HeteroGAT) network to model interactions between user equipments (UEs) and base stations (BSs) in wireless networks, aiming to minimize task transmission delays by strategically deploying digital twins for UEs. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework is introduced to iteratively learn optimal DT placement strategies through gradient-based optimization of a reward function. Furthermore, a convex optimization method based on Lagrangian multipliers is employed to achieve optimal uplink bandwidth allocation, while a DRL-based strategy is designed for power allocation under downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DRL-based algorithm can rapidly learn effective DT placement strategies and achieves superior performance compared to traditional heuristic and benchmark methods."

It also incorporates hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) for efficient route planning. The local motion planning uses advanced modeling to determine speed and direction to avoid obstacles.

Drone flights were conducted over a 2,727 m2 field in Chiba Prefecture, capturing images at various altitudes. YOLOv8 was used to classify the growth stages of cabbage, broccoli, and peanuts. Results showed that early-stage crops required higher image resolution for accurate detection, especially for cabbage and peanuts. Broccoli was detectable at lower resolutions in early stages but became difficult to distinguish as it matured. The findings suggest that the ideal resolution varies by crop type and growth stage, and adjusting drone altitude accordingly can improve detection accuracy. Future work will address labeling quality and detection challenges for later growth stages."

    "abstract": "Modelling the traffic assignment problem (TAP) is essential to capture the travelers' behaviors and predict the flow distribution in transportation networks. This problem has been extensively studied on road and highway networks. However, when multiple modes of transportation, such as cars, trains, planes, or ships, are involved, finding the optimal flow distribution becomes more complex. Different modes of transportation rely on different networks. A supernetwork is a large network that encompasses multiple sub-networks. In this paper, we define the supernetwork and then formulate the traffic assignment problem on supernetworks (TAP-SN) considering demand uncertainty as a linear programming model. The proposed model is solved using the commercial optimization toolbox CPLEX, with promising results, thus confirming the efficiency and effectiveness of the approach."

    "abstract": "Modern data center networks widely deploy Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) technology to meet the performance requirements of applications such as distributed AI training and high performance computing. However, due to the insufficient number of flowlets in RDMA network traffic, existing load balancing techniques struggle to leverage flowlets to improve network transmission performance. Although current solutions proactively insert additional wait time in consecutive packets at the sender to generate additional flowlets in RDMA networks, these additional flowlets may choose a suboptimal path at the host side or still transmit along the original path, resulting in increased transmission delay. Therefore, this paper introduces a proactive flowlet generation approach for load balancing (DBLB) in lossless data center networks (DCNs). DBLB, implemented at source switches, leverages programmable switches to acquire multipath status and proactively generate new flowlets through delaying a small portion of packets for a certain time, where before delaying packets, DBLB ensures the delayed flow can be rerouted to the better path and achieve improved performance. Thus, DBLB enables proactive, timely, and performance-guaranteed rerouting decisions. Experimental results demonstrate that DBLB outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various workloads from real world, reducing the average and tail flow completion time by up to 57 % and 79 %, respectively."

    "abstract": "Dynamic adaptive prognostics method is attracting increasing attention in remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of bearings, owing to selecting different models for prediction, and more accurately capturing the degradation trend. However, existing research exhibits two shortcomings: 1) Existing research constructs model sets that are difficult to comprehensively describe the complex and varied degradation processes of bearings. 2) Existing model selection criteria primarily focus on minimizing fitting error, neglecting the capture of bearing degradation trends. To address the shortcomings mentioned above, a new dynamic adaptive prognostics method based on comprehensive model evaluation criterion (CMEC) is designed for RUL prediction of bearings. Firstly, a complete model set is constructed to comprehensively describe the complex and variable degradation process, and the dynamic selection of the model more accurately captures the changes in the process of bearing degradation. On this basis, CMEC is designed for dynamic model selection, taking into account fitting error, robustness and trendability. Finally, the uncertainty evaluation and RUL prediction results are obtained by the Kalman filter (KF). To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, trend prediction was performed on doublerow tapered roller bearings. Experimental result identifies that the proposed method better describes the process of bearing degradation."

KNN Imputation was useful in filling missing values, making a dataset complete and satisfactory to be used in the modeling process. LASSO feature selection reduced the size of the set of predictors, promoting the computational efficiency and diminishing the danger of overfitting by keeping exclusive economic measures. LightGBM achieves high levels of forecasting accuracy versus conventional econometric models and proved to be very effective in the processing of GDP and inflation forecasting tasks. SHAP integration allowed a clear understanding of the contribution of features to model predictions facilitating the detection of the most valuable features of economic interest in addition to aligning model predictions with the economic theory. Besides powerful preprocessing, which is particularly useful in economies where categorical data become available over time, and succinct feature selection, the presented methodology involves elite gradient boosting, which could provide reasonable accuracy, good insight into the data and efficiency, and hence useful to academic studies and policymaking purposes."

    "abstract": "In the modern marketing era, understanding consumer behavior is key because purchasing decisions are greatly influenced by how consumers respond to the products or services offered. One of the latest approaches to understanding this behavior is neuromarketing, which analyzes the brain's response to marketing stimuli such as advertisements and products. Neuromarketing is rooted in neuropsychology, the science that studies the relationship between brain activity and human behavior. With the help of Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, brain activity can be monitored in real-time to observe cognitive variables such as attention and emotion. This study develops an EEG-based emotion and attention analysis system using Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to handle irregular signal data structures. The process begins with signal filtering using the wavelet method, followed by spatial feature extraction using GCN, and temporal feature extraction with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The results of testing the GCN method showed an accuracy of 88.40%. In the initial stage, various weight correction techniques were compared using four optimization algorithms: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and AdaMax. Adamax achieved the highest accuracy at 88.40%, outperforming Adam (86.85%) and SGD (86.08%). This indicates that Adamax is capable of producing better model generalization compared to the other two optimization techniques. With an accuracy of 88.40%, the system has proven effective in identifying consumer emotions and attention, and holds potential for application in neuromarketing to objectively measure subconscious responses."

In this paper, we clarify the generalization capability of the estimator by examining both estimation performance and its impact on array signal processing under simulated environments with different reverberation times. Furthermore, we explored strategies to improve the estimator, including different model architectures and loss functions. Experimental results show that as the reverberation time increases, the estimation performance decreases and the enhancement performance by MVDR based on steering vectors degrades significantly. Furthermore, the results suggest that enhancement performance can be improved by properly designing the model architecture and loss function."

Existing techniques are limited by poor efficiency and limited mitigation solutions. Therefore, this paper addresses these challenges by a novel resilient multi-task deep learning framework that simultaneously predicts charging demand, detects cyber-attacks, and mitigates the impact of the attack to ensure trustworthy demand prediction. The proposed framework has three key components: LSTM autoencoder for anomaly detection, interpolation-based anomalous data mitigation to preserve temporal continuity, and multi-task learning via Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The framework is validated on a real charging station dataset augmented with realistic anomalies including distributed denial of service and spoofing attacks cyber-anomalies. Experimental results show that our multi-task learning approach achieves superior performance compared to single-task models, with 20% improvement in volume prediction accuracy and 28.3% faster training time. Also, the integrated cyber-attack mitigation method produced trust-worthy datasets that enhance prediction reliability with 8.3%, 4.8% and 4.4% improvements in MSE, MAE and R2 metrics.

The model innovatively uses the area defined by the charging current curve as the input for prediction, which reduces the input dimensionality and model complexity compared with directly inputting the operating condition parameters. A weighted combination of the Squared Exponential (SE) kernel and the Matern <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{3} / \\mathbf{2}$</tex> (M32) kernel is employed to effectively capture the unique characteristics of the area, facilitating the construction of the nonlinear mapping between operating conditions and SOH degradation. Evaluated through leave-one-out cross-validation, the model achieves an overall mean absolute error (MAE) of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{0. 9 4 \\%}$</tex>, enabling precise predictions of lithium-ion battery SOH degradation. Compared with direct operating condition inputs, the area-based approach simplifies the input parameters and the MAE for individual cells was reduced by nearly 1 % at most among all batteries. Furthermore, compared to single-kernel, the model with the composite kernel demonstrates an MAE reduction of up to 5 % at most for individual cells among all batteries, indicating a significant improvement. This study offers a feasible technical approach for predicting lithium-ion battery degradation across diverse operating conditions."

    "abstract": "Most current fake news detection models rely on news content from a single perspective to judge authenticity, ignoring the important role of multi-view information of the news environment in which the news event is located in identifying fake news. At the same time, in the current multi-task model of joint stance analysis, since the tasks are artificially separated, the complementary information between tasks cannot be fully utilized, resulting in insufficient feature interaction between tasks. Therefore, We propose a fake news detection method based on generative information debiasing and multi-task optimization. First, we collect news reports from various perspectives for each event through multi-source platforms such as Weibo and NetEase News. Subsequently, we employ generative language models to reconstruct the multi-source news, generating supplementary text that integrates multiple perspectives. Secondly, the comment features are filtered through the partition filtering network, enabling each task to adaptively filter the key information within the shared features, thereby effectively promoting feature interaction between tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with existing popular methods, the detection model proposed in this study exhibits superior performance."

The accuracy of the model classification was 97%, which was better than that of conventional systems both in accuracy and speed. The system is software-based, completely scaleable, and provides real-time classification using uploaded images or live webcam feed. The system also possesses the feature of underwater classification of waste where video is processed frame by frame to detect and classify submerged waste objects. This feature broadens the application of the system to ocean and waterbody waste monitoring.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an image restoration method based on an optimized JPEG decoder, aiming to address the issue of image bitstream corruption. As a fundamental form of image signals, bitstreams are often damaged by various factors (e.g., wireless channel fading, medium aging, and noise interference), resulting in bit flips that severely degrade image quality. Existing image restoration methods mostly focus on the pixel domain, making it difficult to effectively address structural errors caused by bitstream corruption. To better address this challenge, we propose an optimized JPEG decoder that incorporates compressed sensing techniques to restore and reconstruct the image in the image block-level domain. Our approach can more effectively restore the structural damage of an image, rather than being limited to traditional pixel-level restoration. To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, we simulate bit flips on two sets of real images and construct a bitstream-corrupted image dataset that simulates real-world environments. Under different bit error rates (BER), our method (SCA-CS) outperforms the state-of-the-art (SCA) method in repairing image block colors and eliminating block shift problems."

The use of multicycle scan-based tests with several functional capture cycles between scan operations supports test compaction beyond that possible with single-cycle or two-cycle tests. Multicycle tests with constant primary input sequences are used for avoiding the need to synchronize the primary input sequence with the functional clock. However, this prevents the detection of delay faults in the output cone of the primary inputs. A different solution is to produce the primary input sequence of a multicycle test by the on-chip decompression logic in addition to the scan-in state. This approach is considered in this article. The key new contribution of the article is to extend the scan chain that drives the primary inputs, and add design-for-testability (DFT) logic, to ensure that the primary input sequences produced by the decompression logic are suitable for the application of multicycle tests. Experimental results for transition faults in benchmark circuits demonstrate significant fault coverage improvements and significant test compaction."

It also includes a retrieval-based module that generates expressive upper-body and facial motion conditioned on musical phrasing, and a pedal enforcement component that procedurally animates the feet. Our method addresses the unique challenges of drumming, where rhythm is both heard and seen in dynamic, physically grounded motion.

    "abstract": "This paper devises a multimodal ant colony optimization (MACO) framework to solve multi-solution traveling salesman problems (MSTSPs), which aim to find multiple optimal routes in a single run. Specifically, a dynamic niching strategy is designed to partition the ant colony into exclusive niches based on the route similarity measured by the common edges between two routes. Subsequently, MACO maintains a pheromone matrix for each niche and lets the ants in each niche construct their routes independently based on the associated pheromone matrix. For effective pheromone update, this paper designs a niche and pheromone matrix association rule to match each newly partitioned niche with one pheromone matrix. To further improve optimization efficiency, this paper designs a dynamic critical edge strategy to dig out critical edges during the optimization. Then, these critical edges are cooperated with 2-opt to refine the route constructed by each ant. To preserve the found optimal routes, this paper devises an optimal route preservation strategy to store as many different high-quality routes as possible. Lastly, we instantiate MACO with four canonical ACOs, namely Ant System(AS), Elite AS(EAS), Rank-based AS(ASRank), and Max-Min AS(MMAS), and then conduct extensive experiments to compare them with six state-of-the-art algorithms on the only one MSTSP benchmark suite and the TSPLIB instances. The experimental results reveal that the four MACOs perform competitively with one latest algorithm, but significantly outperform the other five comparison algorithms. Further analysis discovers that ASRank is the most effective one among the four ACOs to cooperate with MACO in solving MSTSPs."

However, the decomposition characteristics and mechanism of mineral transformer oil under repetitive pulse discharge in liquid phase are still unclear in terms of the gaseous production pathways. In this work, the decomposition process of mineral transformer oil under repetitively pulsed discharge are characterized by gas chromatography (GC) and optical emission spectroscopy (OES). Besides, the cracking mechanisms and gas production pathways are deduced by the molecular dynamics and plasma kinetics simulation. The GC experiments show that the proportion of H<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> decreases and that of C<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>H<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> increases with the increase of the repetition frequency and prolonged reaction time.

However, nuclear fusion requires extreme high temperatures, typically enabled by millimetre-wave (mm-wave) sources like gyrotrons, which generate 1 MW continuous wave (CW) power. Unfortunately, gyrotrons are bulky, complex, costly, and have a low production yield (only 15 units worldwide), hindering fusion's commercial viability. To address this issue, we propose using magnetrons as mm-wave sources for a high efficient alternative to gyrotrons. While CW operation is needed for plasma heating, high-power mm-wave magnetrons currently function only in a pulsed mode."

    "abstract": "The schlieren technique is a common technique for visualizing gas flows, fundamentally based on the principle that the refractive index gradient in the flow field under investigation is directly proportional to the gas density of the flow field. In this research, the schlieren method was employed to conduct a detailed examination of the flow field characteristics of needle-to-needle electrode discharges, with a particular focus on the corona discharge and spark discharge patterns under both horizontal and inclined needle-to-needle electrode configurations. The experimental results demonstrate that the ionic wind induced by corona discharge can effectively guide the development of the spark channel. Under the horizontal needle electrode configuration, the ionic wind maintains a high degree of consistency between the spark channel trajectory and the ionic wind streamlines through the synergistic effects of momentum transfer and spatial charge redistribution; whereas under the inclined needle electrode configuration, the degree of channel coincidence is influenced by the curvature radius of the needle tip, with a smaller curvature radius enhancing the guiding effect of the ionic wind. This research highlights the intrinsic connection between corona discharge and spark discharge, confirming the pivotal role of ionic wind in influencing the morphology of discharge channels, and provides insights for future applications of plasma and electrostatic technologies."

During the pulse, the wires are transformed into plasma, and subsequently form a local Z-pinch configuration at the crossing point due to the interaction between the flowing current and the self-induced magnetic field. The evolving plasma alters the impedance of the load, making the temporal measurement of voltage and current critical for understanding the transition of the pinch plasma. Recently, optics-based measurement systems, utilizing the Pockels effect for voltage and Faraday rotation for current, have been developed and integrated into an X-pinch device [Seongmin Choi, et al., Rev. Sci. Instrum. 95, 073531 (2024)]. These systems offer the significant advantage of positioning sensors close to the load, enabling measurements directly on the load. We present the measured temporal evolution of voltage and current on the load using the optics-based measurement system. Then, we discuss the results with a circuit model providing insights into the physical phenomena including the phase transition of the wires and the plasma expansion dynamics."

    "abstract": "We have completed a significant upgrade to the Saturn system at Sandia National Laboratories with the goal of improving the repeatability of radiation output, while reducing the time and labor required for each test. The Saturn system is a pulsed high-brightness source of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\sim 1.5 \\text{MeV}$</tex> endpoint X-rays used for testing the response of material, components, and systems to intense radiation pulses. The system nominally stores 5 MJ total and consists of thirty-six identical modules, each with a microsecond Marx generator and a water-insulated pulse compression system. Energy from the modules is combined in the water near the water-vacuum interface into three balanced power feeds. For a more uniform spatial distribution of the radiation and lower inductance, the three balanced feeds drive three electrically isolated coplanar and concentric annular pinch Bremsstrahlung diode loads. The peak total forward-going power from the pulseforming system is 25 TW. The peak total power dissipated in the load is 15 TW. Total load current at the time of peak load power is generally 9 MA. The upgrades to Saturn include redesigned magnetically insulated transmission lines, a redesigned water-vacuum interface with current and voltage monitors on the anode (ground) side of each of the six feeds, and replacement of the 3 MV pulse-charged, electrically triggered gas switches. The impedance of the Bremsstrahlung loads collapses with a time constant of order 20 ns. For that reason, minimizing the time spread between modules and maximizing electrical power is important for effective energy coupling to the load. We will show the changes to the system and describe process changes intended to improve the reproducibility of the radiation output."

In this paper, a technique to enhance the breakdown stability of graphite electrodes by SiC modification is proposed. The SiC modified layer is generated on the surface of graphite substrate by vapor deposition, and the micro-morphology and construction quality of the modified layer are characterized by scanning electron microscope and energy spectrometer. A high-voltage pulse gas switch test platform was established. The breakdown characteristics of the modified graphite electrode gas switch under the action of millisecond pulse voltage and uniform electric field were investigated experimentally. The regular understanding of the breakdown voltage amplitude and dispersion of this switch is obtained. The results show that under the operating conditions of 0.15 MPa N2 and 5 mm electrode spacing, the graphite electrode switch has an average breakdown voltage of 33.69 kV with a relative standard deviation of 4.50%, and the SiC modified electrode switch has an average breakdown voltage of 36.62 kV with a relative standard deviation of 2.15%. Utilizing the advantage of dense and uniform coating of the modified layer, the electrode breakdown location is more concentrated, which improves the switch breakdown characteristics and reduces the breakdown voltage jitter. Meanwhile, the good mechanical properties of the modified layer also solved the problem of graphite electrode particle shedding and effectively reduced the erosion products."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an improved rotor topology aiming at torque enhancement for high-speed synchronous reluctance motors (SynRMs). Conventional high-speed SynRM rotor requires both tangential and radial ribs for mechanical integrity. However, the ribs increase flux leakage and reduce rotor saliency, consequently deteriorate the torque density. Ribless designs with extra connecting structures have been proposed, which come with high manufacturing and assembly cost. In the proposed structure, symmetrical inner ribs are employed to maintain rotor robustness without the need for additional structures. Moreover, tangential ribs are cut off with the design of asymmetric rotor island tips to improve rotor saliency ratio and reduce torque ripple. Sensitivity analysis of design parameters is performed for staged optimization of the proposed machine. Analysis results demonstrate that the proposed rotor topology delivers higher torque compared to the conventional design while maintaining similar maximum rotor stress. Finally, static and load experiments are conducted, validating the superiority of the proposed rotor topology."

To address this challenge, we propose a novel interpolation model, the Data Interpolation Network with a Collaborative Dual Encoder (DINCoDE). The model adopts a hybrid dual-encoder architecture that integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Transformer encoder, enabling the joint extraction of local and global spatiotemporal features. A composite loss function is employed to ensure both pixel-level accuracy and structural fidelity in the reconstructed data. Experimental results on the OSTIA SST dataset (N=6,575) demonstrate that DINCoDE outperforms the DINCAE and DINEOF models across all evaluation metrics (RMSE = 0.25°C, MAE = 0.16°C, R² = 0.99, SSIM = 0.99) and generates more physically realistic spatial gradient fields. Notably, the pre-trained model demonstrated robust performance when applied to the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) SST dataset (RMSE = 0.38°C, MAE = 0.27°C, R² = 0.99), highlighting its strong generalization ability and potential for operational deployment. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the intrinsic spatial complexity and variability of the SST field are key factors influencing reconstruction performance. DINCoDE offers a high-accuracy, robust, and generalizable method for reconstructing SST data gaps caused by cloud occlusion, providing a reliable solution for SST data reconstruction tasks in oceanographic applications."

    "abstract": "The accurate estimation of atmospheric turbulence dissipation rate (ε) is crucial for better characterizing the atmospheric physical processes and understanding the boundary layer structure. Nevertheless, the ε derived from the traditional spectral width method (SWM) tends to be overestimated using the radar wind profiler (RWP) measurements, due to the non-turbulent broadening effects. To tackle this challenge, here we propose a novel intelligent algorithm that combines SWM and Random Forest (SWM-RF) to estimate ε. The experimental data were synchronized observations from RWP and meteorological tower at the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory site from March to April 2015. Firstly, a systematic analysis was conducted on the overestimation of the SWM under different turbulence intensity, time, and height scenarios. The SWM-RF model is then constructed by introducing the difference function as a physical constraint and combining multiple observation parameters of RWP. The determination coefficient of the ε between sonic anemometers and SWM-RF reached 0.59, and the mean absolute error is 0.007 m² s⁻³. The comparison of results with sonic anemometers under different times and height indicates that SWM-RF model is superior to the SWM and is not affected by variations in height and time. Results shows that the overestimation of SWM is reduced under strong turbulence conditions, while the correction effect is poor in weak turbulence scenarios. Finally, the semi-diurnal cycles of ε for March and April in 2015 are analyzed. The accurate intelligent detection of ε profiles will lay a solid foundation for advancing the understanding of atmospheric physical processes and improving turbulence parameterization."

    "abstract": "The concept of inclusive education increasingly focuses on providing appropriate support for diverse learners, including visually impaired individuals (VIs) who encounter notable difficulties in programming education. Unlike sighted learners who can visually grasp code structure at a glance, VIs depend on screen readers that present code linearly, hindering their ability to comprehend program flow and increasing cognitive load. This study proposes a method that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) to automatically segment the source code into semantically coherent sections along with their corresponding explanatory descriptions. These descriptions are embedded in a screen-reader-compatible block-based programming interface, designed to enhance non-visual code comprehension by providing structured, high-level guidance. An experimental study was conducted with 20 sighted participants blindfolded to simulate non-visual interaction. Participants completed programming tasks using two systems: one with LLM-generated segmentation and one without. The results demonstrate that the segmented system significantly improved task success rates and reduced completion times by over 50% in the most complex task. Additionally, subjective evaluations indicated enhanced usability and comprehension. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-based code segmentation to improve programming accessibility for VIs. Future work includes testing on complex codebases, adding contextual aids, enhancing segmentation flexibility, and conducting broader longitudinal evaluations."

    "abstract": "Searchable encryption enables efficient retrieval of encrypted data stored in cloud environments while preserving data confidentiality. Within this context, Public Key Encryption with Keyword Search (PEKS) allows data users to perform keyword-based searches using their public-private key pairs. However, traditional PEKS schemes remain vulnerable to Inside Keyword Guessing Attacks (IKGA), which led to the introduction of the Public-Key Authenticated Encryption with Keyword Search (PAEKS) paradigm to enhance resilience against insider threats. Despite this advancement, most existing PAEKS schemes rely on number-theoretic assumptions, such as the discrete logarithm problem, thereby becoming insecure in the presence of against quantum adversaries. Consequently, recent research has focused on developing quantum-resistant, lattice-based PAEKS schemes. Although schemes based on the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem provide strong post-quantum security, they often incur high computational and communication costs, limiting their practicality in large-scale cloud environments. To overcome these limitations, this work presents an efficient and verifiable PAEKS scheme based on the Middle-Product LWE (MP-LWE) problem, which preserves the underlying security guarantees while significantly improving performance. Formal security analysis demonstrates resistance against Chosen Keyword Attack (CKA) and IKGA in the random oracle (RO) model. Experimental results confirm that the proposed scheme achieves substantially lower computational and communication overheads compared to existing schemes, while maintaining robust post-quantum security."

    "abstract": "A novel reinforced dual-flow neural network based on attention and a polynomial-based radial basis function network (DFBTP) is proposed to enhance classification performance on tabular data. DFBTP consists of two types of architectures such as advanced Transformer model based on Tabular Prior data Fitted Network (TabPFN) and SV-clustering driven radial basis function neural network (SV-PRBFNN). The conventional PRBFNN model may encounter local minima and noise issues during training, which negatively impacts its performance. Local minima result from initial parameter choices, and noise issues are inherent in the dataset. By introducing the Transformer model and the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), these challenges can be mitigated. Within the dual-flow architecture, the attention flow is trained using Bayesian inference capabilities and structural causal models, and it uses the self-attention mechanism to capture global features. This approach mitigates the problem of local minima. SV-PRBFNN flow uses the fuzzy clustering algorithm based on support vectors to replace the original radial basis function for training. Fuzzy clustering based on support vectors can alleviate the negative impact of outliers on model performance and also reduce the number of fuzzy rules. During neural network hyperparameter optimization, WOA is used to identify the global optimal values for hyperparameters. In the experiments, DFBTP demonstrated its superiority in classification accuracy in comparative experiments on 18 datasets and 13 models, and also performed well on real-world datasets. The robust performance of DFBTP was further validated through statistical analysis of the experimental results."

However, these protocols remain vulnerable to critical attacks, such as forking and partitioning. While the two-phase commit rule can prevent forking, it often requires complex or expensive view-change mechanisms. Moreover, our study confirms that partitioning attacks are feasible in many existing chained BFT protocols. This paper devised NunChuck, a fully two-phase chained BFT protocol that ensures linear authenticator complexity, optimistic responsiveness, and resilience to partitioning attacks. NunChuck employs a lightweight certificate-based view-change mechanism to maintain efficiency, and introduces a unified message structure that enables leaders to make progress even under partitioned network conditions. We formally prove its safety and liveness properties. Furthermore, we develop a prototype implementation in Golang and conduct extensive evaluations. The results demonstrate that NunChuck consistently outperforms HotStuff and FastHotStuff, particularly in adversarial environments, with simulated delay analysis further corroborating our experimental findings."

    "abstract": "BERTopic is a state-of-the-art topic modeling framework that generates topics by clustering contextualized document embeddings. However, its default clustering algorithm, HDBSCAN, often generates an excessive number of topics, which hinders meaningful comparisons or applications in downstream tasks. While different topic reduction methods exist, literature lacks a comparison of these methods and their impact on the quality of the reduced topics. This study offers an in-depth exploration of (1) topic reduction methods for BERTopic, including existing approaches for direct or indirect reduction, and (2) novel techniques that leverage large language models (LLMs), either by using the LLM-generated topic labels to create topic embeddings or by directly prompting the model for identifying overlapping topics. A comparative study of these topic reduction methods is performed, evaluating their performance in terms of coherence and diversity across multiple social media and web datasets. Our findings indicate that indirect topic reduction (e.g., agglomerative clustering) yields more diverse topics, though sometimes at the cost of coherence, compared to direct topic reduction (increasing the minimum cluster size). LLM prompting outperforms agglomerative clustering in both coherence and diversity, though at a higher computational cost. Therefore, we recommend selecting a reduction method based on dataset characteristics, computational resources, and the desired balance between diversity and coherence."

    "abstract": "Subspace clustering has been successful in unsupervised learning by revealing low-dimensional structures in high-dimensional data. However, most existing subspace clustering methods rely on a single self-expressive learning process and neglect the multi-attribute information inherent in real-world data. Moreover, traditional subspace clustering often fails to capture the spatial structure of the data, leading to a loss of important attribute information. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach called Tensorized Non-negative Multi-Attribute Subspace Clustering (TNMSC), which preserves both the spatial structure and the multi-attribute information of the original data. Specifically, TNMSC uses a multi-attribute learning framework to construct separate affinity representations for each attribute, while imposing non-negativity constraints to capture more interpretable and richer features. To further retain spatial information, we introduce a tensor decomposition-based representation that directly operates on the high-order (tensor) form of the data instead of flattened vectors, making our approach particularly advantageous for multidimensional image data. Finally, TNMSC explores consistent topological correlation across different attributes to learn a refined consensus affinity representation that integrates all attribute information. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that TNMSC outperforms state-of-the-art methods. For instance, on the COIL20 dataset, our method achieves a clustering accuracy of 83.71%, surpassing the second-best approach by a significant margin of 5.86%."

    "abstract": "With the emergence of serverless computing and AI training, public cloud platforms have experienced rapid development. Real-time intrusion detection, which allows for proactive defense before network functionality and performance are affected, has become an effective means of securing public cloud environments. eBPF mitigates the overhead associated with real-time network data capture, offering an efficient mechanism for offloading intrusion detection and prevention tasks. However, existing methods still require waiting for the completion of the current flow before initiating detection, rendering it impossible to classify all packets within that flow. This limitation becomes especially critical when dealing with long-lived flows or persistent connections, where existing eBPF-based real-time detection solutions fail to provide defense before the network is impacted. To achieve detection for all packets within network flows, we propose PF-eBPF-an in-kernel solution for fast realtime detection. PF-eBPF employs a classification model that combines both packet-level and flow-level features, while overcoming inherent constraints of eBPF programs including instruction and stack limitations in real-time scenarios. Our method performs packet-level feature inference and packetflow joint inference on the early packets of the flow, without the need to wait for the flow to complete. Evaluations demonstrate that our solution achieves rapid detection for all packets while maintaining model performance and memory overhead comparable to the current state-of-the-art eBPFbased solutions."

This decentralized approach aligns well with privacy regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR and addresses challenges posed by siloed electronic health records (EHRs), medical imaging archives, and genomic data. Despite its growing relevance, FL remains difficult to deploy effectively in healthcare due to data heterogeneity, resource imbalance, and privacy constraints. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of five key FL algorithms—FedAvg, FedProx, SCAFFOLD, FedBN, and pFedMe—evaluated across structured data, imaging, and segmentation tasks using MIMIC-III, MedMNIST, and BraTS datasets. We assess these algorithms in terms of predictive performance, convergence speed, fairness, communication efficiency, and robustness under non-IID settings. Experiments simulate realistic healthcare conditions, including client dropouts, bandwidth constraints, and system variability. Our findings highlight that no single algorithm universally dominates across all tasks. Personalized and variance-reducing methods tend to perform better in diverse data settings, though at the cost of increased complexity. We discuss key trade-offs, scalability limitations, and ethical considerations—including alignment with emerging regulatory frameworks such as the EU AI Act and OECD AI Principles. This paper provides practical guidance for selecting appropriate FL strategies in privacy-sensitive healthcare applications."

This study proposes a soft sensing method for predicting the flow rate of mixed gases by combining capacitive sensors with a backpropagation (BP) neural network. A synthetic dataset was generated by simulating methane–steam mixtures under varying temperature, pressure, and humidity conditions, with sensor capacitance values used as key input features. The neural network was employed to model the nonlinear relationship between the input parameters and the target flow rate, and its training process was optimized using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves extremely high prediction accuracy on both training and testing datasets, with a root mean square error (RMSE) as low as 1.6 × 10⁻⁵. The predicted values closely match the actual measurements, with a tightly centered and unbiased error distribution, indicating strong generalization and robustness. This approach provides an efficient, cost-effective, and scalable solution for online intelligent prediction of natural gas and other mixed gas flows, offering significant potential for practical engineering applications."

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for real-time data processing in Internet of Things (IoT) systems stems from the need for responsive and efficient services across a wide range of applications. A clear example is Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), where service robots-operating as advanced IoT nodes-face constraints in processing power and battery life. To address these limitations, many systems have adopted cloud platforms and remote processing services, enabling robots to offload computation and respond more effectively. However, this architecture introduces a significant challenge: data transfer time. High transfer latency can hinder interaction quality and degrade overall system performance. Although load-balancing strategies have been implemented to distribute tasks across servers, most do not consider the influence of transfer latency on decision-making. To fill this gap, this work proposes a machine learning-based model to predict data transfer time using features such as IP addresses, data size, geographic distance, date, and request time. Among the models tested, the Random Forest algorithm showed the best performance, achieving an R-squared value near 1.0 and the lowest errors in MSE (44.3188), MAE (1.9068), and RMSE (6.6572). A web-based application was developed to implement and validate the model in real time. This tool can be integrated into existing load-balancing systems, allowing them to consider predicted latency when distributing computational tasks. The proposed solution thus enhances resource management in HRI environments and contributes to more autonomous, adaptive, and latency-aware infrastructures across the broader IoT landscape."

    "abstract": "Wireless power transfer (WPT) systems that rely on magnetic resonant coupling (MRC) have advanced considerably in recent years, spurring the development of diverse optimization approaches to enhance charging performance. Nevertheless, existing approaches to performance optimization—such as system frequency regulation and TX current dispatching—focus exclusively on the transmitter (TX)-receiver (RX) level, failing to account for duty cycle (the ratio of time a power switch is on to the total switching period, a key parameter regulating power conversion in WPT systems) adjustment from a system-wide holistic perspective. While duty cycle adjustment exerts a significant impact on the attained power-delivered-to-load (PDL), the area remains underexplored in research. In our paper, we present a PDL maximization strategy based on duty cycle adjustment for single-input multipleoutput (SIMO) scenarios. We first formulate this optimization problem and then transform it into a standard consensus optimization problem, which is subsequently addressed using an algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). A prototype of the presented approach is implemented, and substantial experiments are conducted to assess its performance. The experimental data confirm the effectiveness of our presented algorithm: In comparison with the cutting-edge distributed baseline, our system achieves an average 100.4% improvement in charging performance and maintains performance close to that of the centralized baseline."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the computational resource bottlenecks faced by Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) in Virtual Reality (VR) scenarios. By deploying computational resources at the network edge, MEC brings processing closer to end-user devices, thereby meeting the high bandwidth demands of VR and enhancing the interactive experience and real-time performance of latency-sensitive applications such as VR. However, due to the intensive computational demands of VR applications, including high-definition video encoding and decoding, as well as real-time scene rendering—most existing task scheduling algorithms are based on static assumptions regarding the fixed number of terminals and servers, making them inadequate for dynamic real-world environments where both terminal devices and server resources fluctuate. To address this issue in the context of VR video services, this paper proposes a scalable Dynamic Edge-Cloud Synergistic Task Scheduling (DECS) resource management algorithm. By designing a link-output-based Graph Neural Network (GNN), a scalable distributed scheduling framework is constructed to support flexible resource allocation among any number of edge nodes in an edge-cloud collaborative architecture. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with traditional Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)-based random allocation algorithms, the proposed method exhibits significantly better scalability. Furthermore, in terms of task processing latency, the edge-cloud collaborative architecture reduces delays by 8.52% and 20.54% compared to pure edge computing and pure cloud computing architectures, respectively."

To overcome this challenge, this study addresses the multi-echelon inventory management of batteries in shared electric bicycles using double deep reinforcement learning. An optimization model is formulated, where the failure time, replacement time and charging time of batteries are uncertain and random variables. To solve the randomness of inventory management, the double deep reinforcement learning is used to obtain the optimal order policy and the number of charging piles.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a joint source-channel encoding (JSCE) scheme in an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted multi-user semantic communication system. Semantic encoding not only compresses redundant information, but also enhances information orthogonality in a semantic feature space. Meanwhile, the IRS can adjust the spatial orthogonality, enabling concurrent multi-user semantic communication in densely deployed wireless networks to improve spectrum efficiency. We aim to maximize the users' semantic throughput by jointly optimizing the users' scheduling, the IRS's passive beamforming, and the semantic encoding strategies. To tackle this non-convex problem, we propose an explainable deep neural network-driven deep reinforcement learning (XD-DRL) framework. Specifically, we employ a deep neural network (DNN) to serve as a joint source-channel semantic encoder, enabling transmitters to extract semantic features from raw images. By leveraging structural similarity, we assign some DNN weight coefficients as the IRS's phase shifts, allowing simultaneous optimization of IRS's passive beamforming and DNN training. Given the IRS's passive beamforming and semantic encoding strategies, user scheduling is optimized using the DRL method. Numerical results validate that our JSCE scheme achieves superior semantic throughput compared to the conventional schemes and efficiently reduces the semantic encoder's mode size in multi-user scenarios."

    "abstract": "Telesurgery is one of the fastest growing fields in healthcare where surgeons are able to perform operations remotely through controllers by using robots connected to a high-speed network. Optical fibers are heavily utilized in this process due to the fact that the bandwidth is high, the latency rates low, essentially supporting active real-time data transfer as well as control. However, faults with optical fibers can be problematic at times, causing delays which compromises on the precision and safety of surgeries. This paper presents a DLbased framework for detecting faults and enhancing optical fiber communication in telesurgery. We used deep learning (DL) models like Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to identify these faults from Optical Time-Domain Reflectometer (OTDR) traces. Our models are trained using optimizers like Adam, Nadam, and RMSprop. Among these, LSTM proves to be the most effective, achieving the highest accuracy in fault detection. We also integrated real-time fault detection along with monitoring delays in communication. This innovation ensures that surgical operations can proceed smoothly and accurately."

    "abstract": "As a critical component of aircraft engines, rolling bearings are subjected to complex alternating stresses and wear over time, making them prone to failure, which can affect engine performance and threaten flight safety. Therefore, timely and accurate bearing fault diagnosis is crucial for preventing accidents and extending engine life. However, existing deep learning-based diagnostic methods often perform poorly in practical applications. Hence, developing bearing fault diagnosis methods with high diagnostic accuracy is of great significance for enhancing engine reliability. This paper proposes the DFAMConvNeXt model, which deeply integrates a dynamic fusion attention mechanism with the high-performance, lightweight ConvNeXt architecture. The model significantly improves feature extraction capabilities under complex conditions by mining deep features from time-series data. Experiments conducted on aerospace application bearings and standardized bearing datasets demonstrate that the DFAM-ConvNeXt model exhibits excellent diagnostic performance in bearing fault diagnosis tasks, achieving a maximum accuracy of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 9. 7 5 \\%}$</tex>."

Through the standardization and integration of multi-source data, experimental results, operation behaviors, and environmental parameters were integrated in this study. The data were processed with machine learning algorithms to identify high-frequency error patterns and conduct parameter sensitivity analysis and virtual simulation prediction. The developed system enables personalized learning by adopting behavior analysis. Using operation time tracking, hierarchical resource, advanced and innovative learning packages, and dynamic task adaptation, the system provides multi-person and multi-faceted teaching intervention. Relying on the cloud platform, a cross-temporal and spatial collaboration architecture of the system supports real-time data synchronization across multiple campuses for virtual projects and the analysis of regional data elements. The nonlinear interaction of physiological signals, such as the heart rate and blood pressure, is analyzed by a deep learning algorithm, and the related pathological processes are simulated on a virtual experimental platform. The developed system significantly improves experimental design, the timeliness of teaching feedback, and students' ability amid the digital transformation of medical education."

    "abstract": "With applications in animal monitoring, veterinary diagnostics, behavioral analysis, and robotics, real-time estimation of animal posture is an area of increasing interest in computer vision. In this work, we propose a method based on deep learning approaches to assess animal positions in real time. Selected for their applicability in both home and agricultural settings, the study centres on four animal classes: chicken, dog, horse, and cow. An important output of this work is a bespoke dataset created especially for posture estimation activities, including annotated videos. Every video in the dataset records continuous movement under different lighting and environmental contexts and runs for fifteen seconds. Keypoints marking important body joints for all types of animals were added to the extracted frames. Using the YOLOv8n posture architecture - which provides a balanced trade-off between speed and accuracy - we performed posture estimation. Although YOLO models are usually optimized for object recognition, we fine-tuned YOLOv8n-Pose to predict both bounding boxes and body keypoints, therefore enabling the real-time identification of intricate postural information. Trained on an annotated dataset using supervised learning, the model was tested on another test set from the same distribution. The proposed model achieves a PosePR mAP at the IoU threshold 0.5 of 99.5% in all classes, according to the experimental data. The dog class showed lower precision and F1 scores; the dog and horse classes showed decreased recall. The model maintains strong performance in real-time even if interclass posture variability and occlusion in video frames present natural difficulties. The system handles video input at an average frame rate enough for monitoring systems to be live. This study emphasizes the need for custom data sets tailored to real-world activities and the viability of employing YOLOv8n-Pose for the estimation of animal posture based on key points. Future directions include growing the data set, increasing keypoint accuracy, and including temporal consistency across frames.

    "abstract": "News articles are inherently event-driven, with their semantic structure organized around the development and evolution of real-world events. Traditional summarization approaches often rely on sentence-level extraction, lacking awareness of event progression and discourse-level organization, which leads to fragmented and incoherent summaries. To address this, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates event chain construction with discourse structure modeling. The method captures temporal and causal links between events while incorporating rhetorical and framing strategies at the discourse level, enhancing both semantic completeness and coherence. We implement a neural architecture that jointly models event graphs and hierarchical discourse features. Experiments on benchmark news datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-theart baselines in content coverage, logical flow, and informativeness. This study provides a new perspective on structured summarization by combining event semantics and discourse understanding in a unified model."

Although clinical inspection and Doppler ultrasonography are routine, novel models of Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used to improve prompt diagnosis, risk classification, and salvageability forecasting. We are examining patients with testicular torsion in this case series who presented both when there was still a possible salvage time and those who presented after the salvage time. There is potential that AI-enhanced DSS systems will decrease diagnostic delays especially in the cases of atypical presentations and in resource-constrained environments. Our results outline the clinical appearance, diagnostic methods, surgery, and postoperative results of detorsion surgeries or orchiectomies. These advantages include the early suspicion, fast referral, and the future role of AI-enabled tools in simplifying the triage and surgical preparedness. In conjunction with AI-driven early symptom detection systems, even better testicular salvage rates and fertility outcomes can be achieved through public health education."

With the evolvingly dynamic production demands in context of flexible manufacturing, the Intended Usage Scenario (IUS) of products can be variable. Considering that defect types prone to be triggered into product infant failure vary across usage scenario, this paper proposes a PIFR policy optimization method that adapts to demand variation. The main contribution involves (1) establishing an Scenario and Defect Activation Mapping (SDAM) decomposition model that reasons about the correlations between product usage scenarios and prone-activation defect types, (2) leveraging association relation mining to extract SDAM weights from information associated with the correlations between usage environment and product failure, (3) evaluating PIFRs via SDAM based on IUS specified by production demands, and (4) developing a reinforcement learning algorithm to implement adaptive PIFR control in response to demand variability. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method have been verified via an industrial case of Gas Turbine Bearing Seat (GTBS) manufacturing process."

This study aims to explore the effect of music training on the production of English rhythm by Chinese EFL learners.

    "abstract": "Speaker verification systems are increasingly deployed in security-sensitive applications but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. In this work, we propose the Mask Diffusion Detector (MDD), a novel adversarial detection and purification framework based on a text-conditioned masked diffusion model. During training, MDD applies partial masking to Mel-spectrograms and progressively adds noise through a forward diffusion process, simulating the degradation of clean speech features. A reverse process then reconstructs the clean representation conditioned on the input transcription. Unlike prior approaches, MDD does not require adversarial examples or large-scale pretraining. Experimental results show that MDD achieves strong adversarial detection performance and outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, including both diffusionbased and neural codec-based approaches. Furthermore, MDD effectively purifies adversarially-manipulated speech, restoring speaker verification performance to levels close to those observed under clean conditions. These findings demonstrate the potential of diffusion-based masking strategies for secure and reliable speaker verification systems."

    "abstract": "Timeseries data compression is a critical issue in timeseries databases. So far, many compression algorithms have been proposed, in which lossy compression algorithms generally achieve superior compression ratios compared to their lossless counterparts. However, existing lossy compression algorithms do not account for the storage characteristics of timeseries databases. This paper proposes a novel two-phase compatible lossy compression method named TopcDB for LSM-tree-based timeseries databases. TopcDB addresses two critical challenges in existing approaches: error accumulation during compaction and inefficient compression for small data chunks. It employs an adaptive two-phase compression architecture: Phase 1 utilizes quantization-based error-bounded compression for in-memory chunks. Phase 2 applies entropy encoding with level-aware chunk sizing for LSM-tree-based persistent storage. The novelty of TopcDB includes a merge-friendly Lorenzo predictor, linearscale quantization with mathematical error guarantees, and geometric chunk scaling aligned with compaction patterns. Experimental results show that TopcDB achieves <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$4.1-8.3 \\times$</tex> higher compression ratios than Prometheus while improving write throughput by 147%.

In particular, hospital surveillance footage often exhibits highly uniform backgrounds (white walls, beds, and patient clothing) which complicates person detection, pose estimation, fall detection, and self-harm monitoring under degraded visual conditions. To address this, we present a new Hospital Image Quality Assessment Database (HIQA-DB), which contains 150 original images captured from real hospital Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage. Each reference image has four types of synthetically distorted versions, resulting in a total of 750 images. Subjective quality ratings collected from human evaluators reveal that compression artifacts degrade perceived quality the most and correlate strongly with performance drops in downstream analytics models. HIQA-DB provides a valuable benchmark for understanding and mitigating the effects of image quality on intelligent video analytics in clinical settings, and will be publicly released soon to support further research."

Our findings indicate that LDA outperformed LSA’s topic coherence in the SDCNL’s suicide-related task, by capturing more meaningful themes and achieving an optimal coherence score of 0.6633 with 7 topics. On the contrary, both models showed limited performance with the depression posts, due to the general and passive language. Both models demonstrated complementary strengths in CSSRS, LSA outperformed LDA on emotion-driven labels, such as Supportive and Attempt, whereas LDA successfully identified unique and instructive topics for labels like Indicator and Ideation. The coherence score was not the decisive factor in distinguishing the performance of LDA and LSA in this dataset. The results highlight the potential of topic modelling as a tool for mental health monitoring, offering unique patterns associated with depression and suicide risk."

    "abstract": "This study explores the use of neural networks as lightweight surrogates for guiding value localization over numeric attributes in analytical data systems. Instead of directly modeling key-position mappings, we frame the problem as a multi-class classification task over discretized bins, enabling approximate query support without explicit index structures. The model was trained in a self-supervised manner using pseudo-labels from data-driven binning schemes, requiring no manual annotation. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that our method achieves a classification accuracy above 94.7% for coarse binning <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(K=5)$</tex>, with consistent F1 scores and inference times under 0.6 milliseconds (ms), The approach remains robust under skewed distributions using entropy- or quantile-based binning and is well-suited to latency-sensitive tasks such as filtering or partition pruning. Although this study focuses on univariate attributes, the method is extensible to multivariate scenarios via Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) or attention-based models. Overall, neural surrogates offer a practical complement to traditional indexing for approximate or edge-driven analytical workloads."

    "abstract": "The Repetitive Induction Acceleration Cell (RIAC) is a key component in induction synchrotrons and storage rings. Conventional induction accelerators using matched-cable power feeds suffer from high energy loss in shunt resistors, while direct high-voltage-wire connections introduce parasitic inductance causing waveform distortion. To overcome these limitations, we developed an integrated RIAC with a pulsed Switching Power Supply (SPS) embedded directly in the cavity. This design minimizes parasitic inductance to nH-scale through compact integration. The system employs modular MOSFET-based switching units where mechanical supports also serve as low-inductance current paths and water-cooled heatsinks. Through dual-H-bridge circuits operating in time-division multiplexing configurations, the system achieves effective MHz repetition rate while individual components switch at lower frequency. Experimental results confirm stable 2 kV pulse generation at hundreds of kHz repetition rates, demonstrating significant progress toward full MHz operation. This work provides the foundation for next-generation high-efficiency induction accelerators applicable to XFELs and ion beam therapy systems requiring MHz repetition capabilities."

    "abstract": "The surging model and data size boost the development of distributed model training paradigm, which uses a first-order or second-order optimizer as the fundamental tool. FOSI (First-Order and Second-Order Integration), as a hybrid order optimizer, is regarded as a promising substitute due to its fast convergence speed. However, implementing FOSI distributedly will face two challenges: First, the calculation of the curvature information is restricted on a single GPU device, whose memory is unaffordable when the model becomes large and the dimensionality of the curvature information becomes high, hindering the scalability. Second, frequently updating the curvature information incurs high time consumption, which decreases the acceleration of distributed computing. To overcome these challenges, we propose a distributed hybrid order optimization framework, <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{DHO}_{2}$</tex><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>Our source code is available at: https://github.com/ShunxianGu/DHO2.

Traditional diagnostic pipelines depend on invasive procedures and human analysis of clinical images and data, causing delays or errors. This work presents a novel hybrid deep learning architecture combining Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Vision Transformer (ViT) for enhancing early detection of thyroid cancer from medical images and structured data. ViT efficiently extracts high-level visual features from thyroid ultrasound images, while SVM is optimally capable of classifying weak malignancy patterns in such features. The system includes a preprocessing, feature extraction, training, and testing module, all fully incorporated into a mobile/web- based diagnostic tool. The hybrid model attains a diagnostic accuracy rate of 98%, which is better than that of conventional models. The novelty is in the integration of Vision Transformer with SVM for the detection of thyroid cancer—a new combination heretofore untested—enabling high-performance, non-invasive, and accessible early diagnostics by intelligent automation."

    "abstract": "Gallium nitride high-electron-mobility transistors (GaN HEMTs) offer ultrafast switching capabilities due to their low parasitic components and reduced gate charge requirements. These properties make them well-suited for plasma generation applications, where faster switching operations enhance plasma yield efficiency. Notably, higher switching speeds can be achieved by using an optimized gate driver with high driving current capability and fast rise/fall times. The external and internal parasitics within the gate loop influence the current delivered to the gate, thus significantly impacting the switching speed of GaN transistors. This paper investigates the effects of parasitics associated with two different gate drivers, specifically monolithic Si-based and GaN-based voltage-source drivers, on the rise time of 650 V GaN transistors. For experimental verification, three versions of the monolithic Si-based driver and two versions of the voltage-source driver were constructed. The primary 650 V transistor was evaluated in pulsed operation with a resistive load, reaching pulse voltages and currents of up to 610 V and 107 A, respectively. Experimental results show that, with the monolithic Si-based gate driver, the current rise rate ranges from <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$24.74 \\text{kA}/\\mu \\mathrm{s}$</tex> to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$26.87 \\text{kA}/\\mu \\mathrm{s}$</tex> across different designs.

Challenges related to photon-to-electron conversion, readout noise, and increasing architectural complexity due to sensor miniaturization were also examined to propose technical solutions. The state-of-the-art strategies developed so far include back-side illuminated (BSI) pixel structures, enlarged pixel designs, correlated double sampling (CDS), adaptive analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), and advanced anti-reflective coatings. The adaptability of CIS technologies in expressway traffic management systems is critical for effective vehicle detection and monitoring under fluctuating illumination and adverse weather conditions. Recent technological advancements lead to significant performance improvements, including quantum efficiency exceeding 90%, signal-to-noise ratio enhancements of 10 dB, and dynamic range expansion surpassing 75 dB. Nonetheless, an optimal balance among sensitivity, resolution, and cost remains a challenge in CIS development. Through the integration of novel semiconductor materials, machine learning–based noise suppression techniques, and advanced noise reduction algorithms are used to enhance sensor performance.

A key challenge arises from the complex inter-dependencies among 3D content chunks, often represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), which conventional caching strategies fail to capture effectively. In this work, we propose a dependency-aware caching framework based on DAG-guided reinforcement learning. At its core is a policy optimization mechanism built upon Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which learns to make cache admission and replacement decisions by explicitly modeling chunklevel DAG dependencies. This enables the system to prioritize critical content while avoiding redundant transmissions and excessive fetch delays. To further improve learning efficiency and convergence, we introduce a compact DAG encoding scheme and a dependency-sensitive reward function that together guide the policy training. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method reduces average retrieval latency by up to 26.5%, increases cache hit ratio by 10.7%, and significantly enhances overall edge resource utilization."

    "abstract": "Unsupervised anomalous sound detection (ASD) aims to detect anomalous sounds by modeling only normal sounds. Conventional methods use classification-based selfsupervised neural network models to identify normal and abnormal sounds. Building on this idea, Additive Angular Margin Loss (ArcFace) is utilized to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class discrepancy of normal classes. Furthermore, previous methods introduce mixup to ensure intra-class compactness and alleviate the overlap of normal and anomalous data distributions. However, the additive angular margin applies only to a single target logit but not to learning from interpolated labels and samples generated by mixup. Additionally, its fixed margin is unsuitable for data with inconsistent intra-class and inter-class variations. To solve these issues, we propose a training method applying an elastic angular margin loss to mixup data augmentation, namely Elastic-Margin-Mixup (EMM). The proposed EMM weights the margin penalty by the interpolation factor, enabling the ArcFace loss to adapt appropriately to interpolated samples. Moreover, it introduces proportional randomization across differently weighted margins to further help the model handle inconsistent variations both between and within classes. On the DCASE 2020 Challenge Task 2 dataset, experimental results demonstrate that our proposed EMM achieved an AUC of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 5. 0 3 \\%}$</tex> and a pAUC of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{8 9. 9 5 \\%}$</tex>, surpassing previous approaches integrating ArcFace and mixup for anomalous sound detection."

In particular, multi-step RUL prediction facilitates the early detection of potential failures, thereby significantly improving system reliability and operational safety. However, existing lightweight deep learning models often face challenges in multi-step RUL prediction, primarily due to limited training data and constrained representational capacity. Recent advances in large language models (LLM) have shown remarkable generalization abilities and expressive embedding power, suggesting a promising new direction for addressing these limitations. In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for multi-step RUL prediction of gearboxes, which harnesses the representational strengths of LLMs. The framework integrates parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to adapt LLMs effectively to time series forecasting tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.

Specifically, we analyze neurons associated with k-means clusters of self-supervised features and i-vectors. Our analysis reveals that these clusters correspond to broad phonetic and gender classes, making them suitable for identifying neurons that represent speakers. By protecting these neurons during pruning, we can significantly preserve performance on speaker-related task, demonstrating their crucial role in encoding speaker information."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of satelliteassisted satellite networks, the imbalance in satelliteaircraft communication resource allocation has become a critical bottleneck constraining network service quality. Traditional static allocation schemes and single-layer optimization mechanisms struggle to meet the varying demands of dynamic network environments. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes a dual-layer dynamic game architecture for optimized resource allocation. This architecture includes an initial game layer dominated by aircraft nodes and a secondary game layer led by satellite platforms. By dynamically optimizing utility functions, incorporating historical behavior preference mechanisms, and employing adaptive decision-making strategies, the proposed method achieves cross-layer collaborative resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that this approach ensures network performance stability while achieving comprehensive performance improvements, including reduced energy consumption, enhanced resource utilization, and optimized load balancing."

    "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), involved in protein synthesis, becomes stressed under various stimuli, which may lead to diseases such as diabetes mellitus. The unfolded protein response (UPR), as an ER stress response, has been reported to be activated by nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nspEFs). However, the activation is weak or cell dependent. Strong UPR activation by nsPEFs could be useful for preventing or treating ER stress-related diseases. This study aimed to determine suitable nsPEF conditions for UPR activation. Using a Blumelein pulse-forming line (B-PFL), nsPEFs were applied to EGFP-293A cells, which express green fluorescent protein (GFP) upon UPR activation. The pulse width, voltage, and pulse number were varied. Cell viability was measured immediately and 24 hours after nsPEF exposure, and fluorescence intensity was analyzed. GFP fluorescence increased compared to untreated samples, with significant enhancement under some conditions, although cell viability was reduced in those cases. These results suggest that UPR activation and cell death occur under closely related conditions."

    "abstract": "Considering that actual systems are often constrained by multiple factors such as state limitation, actuator saturation and actuator failure at the same time, this paper provides an effective solution for non-affine multi-player systems, which can guarantee the required performance while saving communication cost. Initially, an auxiliary system is established to accommodate state limitations, following which the controller design is partitioned into two distinct segments, addressing different types of faults. Specifically, the discontinuous and continuous aspects of the controller are achieved by sliding-mode control (SMC) and adaptive critic design (ACD), respectively. During the implementation of ACD to solve the guaranteed value function incorporating the utility function designed for the asymmetric saturation of the control input, two adaptive schemes including adaptive event-triggered impulsive control (AETIC) and adaptive self-triggered impulsive control (ASTIC) are introduced successively. It is proved that the system maintains exponential stability rather than asymptotic stability and the state signals keep ultimately uniformly bounded (UUB). Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control sequence is verified by simulation comparisons."

However, its reliance on orbital representation presents a significant drawback: as wavenumber increases, the need for empty bands grows, making LR-TDDFT impractical for XRTS modeling across large energy scales. In this work [6], we consider an alternative approach that employs the Liouville-Lanczos (LL) method [7], [8] for simulating the DSF. This method does not require empty states and allows access to the DSF at large momentum transfer values and a broad frequency range.

This research proposes an innovative framework for enhanced network intrusion detection called Quantum Computing-Assisted Data Mining (QCADM). The framework overcomes the shortcomings of traditional approaches to dealing with complicated, massive amounts of network traffic data by using algorithms supplemented with quantum bits for feature selection, grouping, and classification. To enhance computing efficiency and optimize anomaly detection, QCADM uses quantum versions of Support Vector Machines (qSVMs) and Principal Component Analysis (qPCA). This result of the NSL-KDD dataset indicates that the framework beats traditional methods: 40% faster with much lower false positive rates. According to research, quantum computing offers a scalable and economical approach to handle complicated cyber threats and, hence, intrusion detection systems can be improved. In the further efforts, the study will overcome the limitations of present quantum gear and move towards real-world deployment."

We reviewed recent advancements in deepfake detection across multiple modalities, including image, video, and audio. Benchmark datasets, such as FaceForensics++, the deepfake detection challenge (DFDC), and Celeb-deepfake (Celeb-DF), have been used to develop diverse detection models. These models encompass approaches based on EfficientNet-driven transfer learning, convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) hybrids for temporal feature extraction, graph-based neural architectures, and ensemble methods that integrate deep learning with handcrafted features. Although certain models report detection accuracies as high as 99.99% on specific datasets, many exhibit limited generalizability across different benchmarks, particularly when confronted with compression artifacts. Additionally, real-time deployment remains constrained by substantial computational demands. Emerging threats, including adversarial perturbations and diffusion-based synthetic media, necessitate the development of more resilient detection strategies. Proactive countermeasures such as blockchain-based timestamping, digital watermarking, and cryptographic hashing have been adopted to enhance media integrity. The results of the review underscore the need for lightweight, interpretable, and multimodal detection frameworks to generalize the models' applicability across diverse domains, thereby supporting reliable and scalable media verification in increasingly complex digital environments.ion."

Research on animal-computer interactions (ACI) has changed concepts like user, welfare, evaluation, and participatory design, as the design of technology with animals as users, participants, and beneficiaries has required new concepts. We propose that ACI research has the potential to transform an even more fundamental concept: what an “animal” is. We hypothesize that ACI researchers have often been operating with essentialist concepts of animal categories such as species, breeds, or even categories like dog, bird, ape, and wild animal, where those grouping have aimed to reflect “biological” or “natural” groups that are fixed and unchanging. Drawing from the social philosophers Sally Haslanger’s and Ian Hacking’s methods of analyzing socially constructed categories, we propose that the essentialist concept of animal categories could inhibit ACI research and produce technologies that reinforce the existence of such categories. In turn, research on animal-technology interactions, if conducted with a social constructionist conception, could disrupt conceptions of animal categories, revealing ways in which animal categories are produced by animals’ material and social conditions, including their technological realities, and could change with changing technologies, opening new doors for ACI research and beyond."

Typically, a high-voltage power converter is required to charge the capacitors up to several kilovolts. In order to achieve a high repetition rate, high power in the range of megawatts is necessary. A compact design is essential since the railgun system is supposed to be mobile. In addition, a high electrical efficiency is important to keep both, the cooling effort and the primary energy demand low. Literature research shows that resonant converters are perfectly suited for these requirements since they provide high efficiency and the option for a modular design. Due to their low (switching) losses, the switching frequency can be increased, which decreases the size of other complementary components and ultimately increases the power density. Given the intricate nature of resonant converters, developers are faced with various design choices."

However, with the explosion of multi-layer LEO mega-constellations(MLMCs), how to use the least number of computing nodes to achieve computing power resource coverage? This paper proposes a computing node deployment algorithm for MLMCs to construct satellite computing network with the minimum number of computing node. Specifically, we analyze the existence conditions of optimal computing node deployment, and derive the expression of the relationship between the number of computing nodes needed on the LEO, the multi-layer satellite network structure and the number of accessible hops of computing nodes. The expression can determine the minimum number of computing nodes needed to be placed on the MLMCs to realize optimal computing node deployment under a certain number of accessible hops. Then, according to the limitation of optimal computing node deployment, a multi-layer satellite network computing node deployment algorithm is proposed to determine the position of the computing resource in MLMCs, which can form a stable computing structure in satellite network. Finally, through simulation, the influence of network scale and computing node deployment on the number of required computing nodes and the effectiveness of signaling delay is analyzed. The simulation results show that this method can achieve better delay with the least number of computing nodes, balance the number of computing nodes and delay, and meet the specific network requirements."

    "abstract": "The movable antenna (MA) technology has attracted great attention recently due to its promising capability in improving wireless channel conditions by flexibly adjusting antenna positions. To reap maximal performance gains of MA systems, existing works mainly focus on MA position optimization to cater to the instantaneous channel state information (CSI). However, the resulting real-time antenna movement may face challenges in practical implementation due to the additional time overhead and energy consumption required, especially in fast time-varying channel scenarios. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a new approach to optimize the MA positions based on the users’ statistical CSI over a large timescale. In particular, we propose a general field response based statistical channel model to characterize the random channel variations caused by the local movement of users. Based on this model, a two-timescale optimization problem is formulated to maximize the ergodic sum rate of multiple users, where the precoding matrix and the positions of MAs at the base station (BS) are optimized based on the instantaneous and statistical CSI, respectively. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, a log-barrier penalized gradient ascent algorithm is developed to optimize the MA positions, where two methods are proposed to approximate the ergodic sum rate and its gradients with different complexities. Finally, we present simulation results to evaluate the performance of the proposed design and algorithms based on practical channels generated by ray-tracing. The results verify the performance advantages of MA systems compared to their fixed-position antenna (FPA) counterparts in terms of long-term rate improvement, especially for scenarios with more diverse channel power distributions in the angular domain."

    "abstract": "Anxiety is a common mental health condition that can significantly impair daily functioning, especially for university students in STEM. State anxiety is a situational emotional response and is typically assessed through self-reported questionnaires and clinical interviews. These traditional methods only capture discrete snapshots of an individual's emotional state and rely heavily on retrospective reporting. To overcome the limitations of self-reporting, we use wearable and contactless sensors. We continuously monitor a set of physiological signals (electrodermal activity (EDA), blood volume pulse (BVP), heart rate variability (HRV), and skin temperature (TEMP)) along with a behavioral signal (Speech) to detect state anxiety in real-time. We evaluate the predictive capabilities of these signals concerning self-reported anxiety levels, as measured by the six-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6). Machine learning (ML) models are employed to classify participants into state anxiety risk groups based on two thresholds: clinical (STAI-6 score <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\gt $</tex-math></inline-formula> 15) and median-based (STAI-6 score <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\gt $</tex-math></inline-formula> median).

Additionally, speech features demonstrate competitive performance in certain conditions, while EDA, TEMP, and HRV exhibit greater variability. We believe that this study supports using wearables to monitor state anxiety."

    "abstract": "As a fundamental security mechanism for wireless Internet of Things (IoT) devices, Radio Frequency Fingerprinting Identification (RFFI) faces significant challenges in open environments and cross-domain deployments. Among existing deep learning-based open-set recognition (OSR) methods, prototype-based approaches are widely adopted. However, these methods often suffer from prototype drift and feature misalignment between source and target domains due to channel effects, device load variations, and other factors. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Prototype Calibration Domain Adaptation Framework guided by Pseudo-labeling and Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN), termed PCPD. The framework first leverages a prototype network to learn discriminative representations for each class in the source domain. Subsequently, it employs pseudo-label loss and a domain discriminator to dynamically calibrate domain-shifted prototype points, enhancing feature alignment across domains. Based on the calibrated prototypes, the method significantly improves OSR performance in cross-domain scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that PCPD outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving an approximately 10.8% improvement in OSR accuracy under cross-domain conditions."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in numerous domains, yet their clinical deployment faces critical barriers, particularly insufficient reasoning in complex scenarios and limited interpretability. These challenges are exacerbated in neurosurgical diagnosis for outpatient and emergency settings, where time-sensitive decision-making, fragmented data, and complex comorbidities render conventional free-text-based modeling approaches unreliable. To address the limitations of existing LLMs in medical auxiliary diagnosis, particularly in interpretability and predictive performance, this study proposed NRAG, an auxiliary diagnosis method that combines LLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs). It extracts symptom descriptions from clinical records and performs personalized retrieval of associated paths in KG, and supplements potential patient symptoms to optimize the diagnosis model. Comparative experiments involving multiple general-domain and medical-domain LLMs, along with case studies, were conducted to validate the NRAG's effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating KG significantly improves diagnosis accuracy, achieving an F1-score of 0.8150. It also substantially improves model interpretability and performs excellently in expert evaluations. Ablation studies and comparative experiments with other general-domain and medical-domain LLMs confirm the superior performance of the proposed NRAG. NRAG effectively supplements missing symptom information and provides knowledge-path-based evidence for diagnosis results, while improving the precision and interpretability of intelligent diagnosis. Furthermore, this approach sets the foundation for intelligent diagnoses in neurosurgery while providing a methodological framework for the integration of in-depth clinical data mining with medical knowledge base resources."

    "abstract": "Pulsed power technology, with its emphasis on compactness, lightweight miniaturization and solid-state design, serves as the foundation for high-power microwave systems. While the application of semiconductor switches, such as Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs), has accelerated the transition to more compact and solid-state systems, the redundant packaging originally designed for DC/AC operation limits further improvements in power density for pulsed power systems. This paper introduces a 3-D Switch Array (3DSA) module specifically designed for pulsed power technology based on IGBT bare dies. Through chip-on-chip 3D packaging, a large series-parallel switch array is distributed on both sides of a multilayer printed circuit board (PCB) substrate, significantly enhancing the power density. Additionally, the dual power loop structure of the 3DSA reduces parasitic inductance through decoupling, which plays a crucial role in achieving fast rise times in pulsed power systems. To synchronize the driving of the series-parallel switch array, a fast array driver circuit based on planar transformer isolation is designed, which, together with the switch array, forms the complete 3DSA module. Experimental results show that a 6-series, 6-parallel 3DSA module, operating at a 5.5 kV voltage and discharging at 3.3-ohm impedance, achieves a pulse current rise time of 39 ns (limited by the inductance of the discharge circuit), with a peak current of 1450 A. Compared to a discrete switch array, the peak volumetric power density and peak weight power density are increased by 7 times and 12 times, respectively. Finally, a prototype of the solid-state Blumlein generator is manufactured based on the 3DSA module. Under a 6.6-ohm resistive load, the generator achieved a quasi-square pulse with a current of 738 A, a voltage of 4974 V, a rise time of 24 ns and a pulse width of 130 ns."

Compared to traditional explosive-type DCCBs, pulse current-driven metal wire explosion-type DCCBs can generate plasma with higher energy density, producing strong shockwaves with advantages such as low cost and low pollution. This paper presents the design of the driving mechanism for the metal wire explosion-type DCCB and uses Ansys simulations to validate the rationality and reliability of the structure. A high-energy metal wire explosion experimental platform capable of storing hundreds of kilojoules was developed. The stability of the platform and the feasibility of the experimental setup were validated. By controlling external energy inputs and optimizing the metal wire material properties, the optimal correlation between the physical parameters of wires and the energy storage of the system was established. Experimental results confirmed the feasibility of the metal wire explosion-type DCCB in terms of shockwave intensity, interruption speed, and cost-effectiveness. The developed optimization formula significantly enhanced the shockwave energy produced by the metal wire explosion. The findings of this study provide a theoretical basis for the application of metal wire explosion-type DCCBs in magnetic confinement fusion devices and high-power DC switching applications."

    "abstract": "Change detection (CD) is a critical task in remote sensing (RS) image analysis. Recent deep learning networks for CD focus on identifying changes after mining the features of bi-temporal images separately. However, light differences in bi-temporal images lead to the networks extracting different features from the identical objects, which may cause pseudo-changes. From the Fourier transform perspective, an image can be decomposed into amplitude and phase, where the amplitude contains most of the light information and the phase is relevant to structure information. Therefore, amplitude-invariant features of the identical objects in different light conditions are roughly the same, which are pivotal to identify real and fake changes between bi-temporal images. In this article, we propose a capturing amplitude-invariant features network (CAIFNet), which reduces dependence on amplitude and captures diverse amplitude-invariant features. Firstly, we build an amplitude pre-processing module (APM) to provide diverse processed images by randomly mixing the amplitudes of the input images with the amplitudes of the reference images and keeping the phases of the input images constant. Secondly, a quadruple-stream encoder is proposed to capture amplitude-invariant features. Specifically, it is forced to learn and capture amplitude-invariant local details and amplitude-invariant contextual semantics based on the diverse processed images under CD task-oriented constraint, both reciprocate each other to become more accurate by local attention guide strategy (LGS). Moreover, a difference enhancement module (DEM) is designed in the quadruple-stream encoder to enhance the difference features. Thirdly, a bi-stream decoder decodes the captured amplitude-invariant features in main and boundary difference perspectives, enhancing main body and boundary details of the objects in the change maps, respectively. Finally, a spatial embedded module (SEM) allows the main and boundary difference features to be embedded into each other, obtaining more complete change maps. On three remote sensing change detection (RSCD) datasets, CAIFNet achieves better transferability and results compared to state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Biorobots involve embedding artificial components into a living insect to transform it into a controllable robot, which comes with the advantages of low energy consumption, quietness, and flexibility. However, no models have yet been developed to describe the randomness-filled motions of biorobots, and their unique biological properties are also underutilized. In this work, the locomotion responses of a biorobot to electrical stimuli were summarized. The constant-current signal was found to have a higher capacity for sustained stimuli than existing methods. The joint influence of wall and current factors on cockroach behavior was explored to establish an environment-adaptive control model describing their locomotion. This model was then used to propose an navigation method enhanced by the inherent nature of a biorobot. In an indoor scenario, the proposed method achieved a success rate of 78.6% with minimal runtime and stimulus number while the control group using conventional navigation methods achieved a success rate of 30%, with two or three times the runtime and stimulus number. Compared with other approaches, the proposed method facilitates high-precision and long-range navigation with a short navigation time and very low control costs."

    "abstract": "When a transformer is energized, the inrush current can reach several tens of times higher than the steady-state magnetizing current, which may cause maloperation of protective relays, voltage dips, and deterioration of power quality. The inrush current occurs when the applied voltage phase at the instant of energization does not coincide with the residual flux in the transformer core, resulting in excessive flux that drives the core into saturation. This paper proposes a method to reduce such inrush currents by controlling the optimal energization angle of three-phase transformers to minimize residual flux asymmetry. The proposed approach utilizes a phase-locked loop (PLL) to track the source voltage phase and applies the mathematically derived optimal energization angle to suppress the inrush current. The validity of the method was preliminarily verified through simulations and further confirmed experimentally under both no-load and load conditions. Based on the measured voltage and current waveforms, ϕ–<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</i> hysteresis loop analysis, harmonic spectrum, and total harmonic distortion (THD) evaluation were performed to compare the results quantitatively. The objective of this study is to clarify the mechanism of inrush current generation and to experimentally verify that inrush current can be effectively reduced through energization angle control by mitigating residual flux asymmetry."

    "abstract": "Introduction: The popularity of excessive window tinting of cars is also increasing in metropolitan Malaysia because it reduces heat, has anti-glare effects and offers privacy. Nevertheless, its impact on road safety, especially, the loss of visibility in the low-light conditions and violation of regulatory limits, is still of concern. Despite Visible Light Transmission (VLT) rules in place in Malaysia, there still exists inconsistency in enforcement and perceived ideas of the same, which makes it a risk.Objective: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the perception of drivers on excessive window tinting in Kuala Lumpur concerning their awareness, perceived risk level, compliance behaviour, attitude to enforcement, and individual responsibility as well as the possible application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in supporting data-driven road safety measures.Methods: A 6 section validated questionnaire was used to carry out a cross-sectional survey of 52 drivers. The analysis of data was performed using SPSS (descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA, linear regression), and the study provides information on how AI-based modelling might be used to complement the traditional statistical methods by forecasting behavioural patterns and enhancing the monitoring of compliance.Findings: The respondents exhibited moderate knowledge of tinting regulations with many indicating that they had a neutral or limited knowledge. The excessive tinting was seen as a safety concern especially during low visibility. There were split compliance perception views with the majority of the people on the side that said there should be stricter compliance enforcement and personal responsibility.Conclusion: The research results indicate that policy efficacy and road safety might be improved with the help of focused public awareness, regular inspection, and AI-based analytics on compliance check-ups. The way in which AI-based perception analysis and predictive modelling can reinforce awareness campaigns, enforcement strategies, and regulatory compliance should be investigated in future research."

The previously proposed sparse-coded time-delay graph dynamic mode decomposition (STG-DMD) derived time evolution equations from water level data on an undirected graph structure, achieving high-accuracy predictions by considering multiple location connections. However, because the connections were defined as undirected graphs, the river flow direction was not considered. Therefore, this paper aims to incorporate river flow direction using a directed graph structure. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, performance evaluation experiments were conducted using both artificial and real observation data. The reproducibility of the proposed method was evaluated using water level data generated by process-driven models. In the experiment, water level data were collected via web scraping from the Internet, and river water level distribution was predicted. The results of the performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms STG-DMD."

    "abstract": "Virtual product placement (VPP) aims to seamlessly insert a product into a pre-recorded video. It is gaining attention as a flexible and scalable strategy for digital advertising, where user preferences and subjective choices should be considered. However, the conventional VPP methods adopt fully automatic insertion frameworks without user involvement, which limits their adaptability to subjective scenarios. To address this limitation, we proposed a user-guided and local motion-adaptive framework, called ULM-VPP, for video VPPs. Given a video and a virtual product, the proposed system obtains an initial target region for the product placement and nearby keypoints in the first frame for minimal user interaction. For each subsequent frame, both the target region and virtual product are realigned based on local motion inferred from the keypoints. Finally, the virtual product is inserted seamlessly into the updated region over all frames while maintaining temporal consistency. Experiments across various video sequences demonstrate that ULM-VPP produces geometrically stable and visually coherent results. The source code is available at https://github.com/halikes/ULM-VPP"

    "abstract": "Speech recognition technology still does not meet the needs of a majority of people who suffer from dysarthria. Existing systems provide transcripts that end up being broken and disjointed and grammatically flawed and unable to convey speaker intended meaning. Such systems regard transcription as the end of the conversation process rather than the beginning points for understanding. This paper comes up with a new assistive system that employs post-processing to build meaning in an intelligent way. The system's core works on FLAN-T5-Large that acts as a robust language model to reason about contextual information and semantic relations. The system works through three interdependent steps: the initial step utilizes a Whisper ASR model specifically trained on dysarthric speech to translate audio into raw text. The language model then applies this text to create meaningful fluent language that mirrors what the speaker wished to say. The last part of the system employs a Text-to-Speech synthesizer to transcribe the corrected text into natural and expressive speech output. The system converts disfluent input into comprehensible expression to enable people with dysarthria to communicate fluently."

Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been pivotal in tasks such as celestial object classification; yet their limitations in capturing global context have spurred interest in Transformer-Based architectures. In this study, we explore the efficacy of ConvNeXt, a modern CNN enhanced with Transformer-Inspired features, and Vision Transformer variants (ViT, Swin Transformer, DeiT, BEiT) for classifying seven Messier objects from a curated dataset of astronomical images. We benchmark these models against conventional CNNs (ResNet-50, EfficientNet, MobileNet, Inception). Our results reveal that the Swin Transformer achieves the highest test accuracy (97.14%), followed closely by ConvNeXt (96.43%), while DeiT and BEiT excel in training (99.96%) but show reduced generalization. These findings suggest that Swin Transformer and ConvNeXt offer a superior balance between accuracy and scalability for astronomical tasks, highlighting the potential of hybrid architectures to address the challenges of large-scale celestial datasets and paving the way for future advancements in automated astronomical classification."

This work proposes a novel framework combining virtual electrode generation, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), contrastive learning, and channel-wise attention to enhance spatial resolution, robustness, and adaptability across subjects. Virtual electrodes improve spatial detail through interpolation, while GCNs capture spatial correlations between real and synthetic electrodes. Contrastive learning enhances the discriminability of the features by making similar or closely related stress-level embeddings close and the dissimilar or far apart and data augmentation enhances the generalizing ability of the model when subjected to different conditions. The channel attention mechanism is used to dynamically emphasis or de-emphasize the electrode importance in order to minimize the noise effect. Through the thorough testing in DEAP and SWELL-KW datasets, the accuracy is excellent (95.21 percent), the generalization is good since the testing is done on subject-independent mode, and the system is robust to noisy and skewed data. Our method has been proposed as ready to be deployed in real-time, which is an excellent solution to robust and interpretable EEG-based stress detection."

    "abstract": "Recently, many industries have shifted from relying on manual labor to automation. Industrial robotics is one important form of automation, with the robotic arm being one of the most versatile, capable of performing a wide range of tasks. According to the International Federation of Robotics, in 2021 there was a 14% increase in the number of active industrial robots compared to 2016. Despite the benefits of automation, routine maintenance is still needed and breakdowns still occur, leading to costly downtime. For example, in the automotive industry, loss of production costs up to US$50,000/minute. To reduce loss due to downtime, we propose as the solution a robotic arm replacement system that uses unmanned vehicle and fault detection. The robotic arm has pre-aligned wiring which can be automatically attached and detached, it also has a centralized control system able to configure their functions automatically. The replacement system will run automatically using a fault detection system based on the built-in sensors of the robotic arm and computer vision. If a fault is detected, the production line will be adjusted and an unmanned vehicle will be sent to replace the faulty robotic arm. Other than that, the system can be used when routine maintenance is needed. Unmanned vehicle and fault detection sensors have been used for a long time in the industry. Integrating both with robotic arm can create a functional system that meets the expected output. Modern robotic arms often have built-in sensors that can detect anomalies, making fault detection easier."

    "abstract": "Temporary teams help the industry chain enhance its ability to deal with seasonal fluctuations in demand or unexpected incidents. However, it also presents greater variability among the workers and imbalance between teams. Furthermore, an excessive worker transfer rate will seriously affect the stability of the team. Thus, the imbalance in the performance levels among teams will also impact the overall progress. How to form stable and balanced temporary teams (FSABTT) has become a critical issue in the establishment of temporary teams. Notably, the Environment - Classes, Agents, Roles, Groups, and Objects (E-CARGO) model, a mature and proven effective tool, demonstrates outstanding performance in the study of such social issues. By extending the Group Role Assignment (GRA) model, this paper formalizes the problem. In addition, by introducing dual-threshold control, we propose a new multi-criteria evaluation method, which includes the worker transfer rate and the team average level balance as key criteria. The Group Role Assignment (GRA) model is incrementally extended through a series of simulation experiments. The improved model effectively reduces the worker transfer rate and balances the team average performance of new and old teams with only minimal performance trade-offs. This will help decision-makers quickly form stable and balanced temporary teams."

The system generates bounding boxes around vertebrae as segmentation prompts and employs an interpolation strategy to address potentially missed compressed vertebrae.

The associated optimization problems are solved using convex formulations and standard convex solvers. Clustering techniques are introduced to discretize continuous phase-shift values into arbitrary groupings, enabling flexible trade-offs between the symbol error rate (SER) and hardware implementation complexity. The proposed strategies in this study are compared with benchmark methods in terms of signal power, channel vector orthogonality among users, and end-to-end SER across various system configurations.

Moreover, to cope with environmental changes without model retraining, we employ a vector database indexed by the feature vectors of the minor components as the machine learning model, and perform prediction of the obstacle positions and received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) via a nearest-neighbor search of the database. Numerical experiments using measured APPs from an indoor mmWave communication environment demonstrate that the proposed method achieves prediction accuracy comparable to that of a supervised model using LightGBM, while the proposed approach does not require any retraining.

In recent years, the use of clinical support systems has grown in popularity. In addition to its significant benefits in improving healthcare efficiency, it also raises several ethical questions. In this research, three case studies of real AI applications in the medical field have been investigated. The first one is PainChek®, an AI pain assessment tool utilized in Australian residential care. It is helpful for people, especially those who are not able to speak, to express their pain levels, but issues such as transparency, security, and accuracy are raised. The second example is IDx-DR, an FDA-approved automated method for identifying retinopathy in diabetic patients. Even while it can lower costs, there are still some issues with data management transparency, possible risks, and consequences on human specialists. The last case study discusses a hospital’s deployment of an AI-assisted end-of-life system. Although the system can boost physicians’ confidence and lower treatment costs by improving resource allocation, its shortcomings include bias and trust. To address those challenges, a framework has been developed for tracking ethical dilemmas that arise when developing machine learning models for medical applications. The framework combines policy regulation with model implementation processes. This framework aims to help the AI-based clinical system become more transparent and responsible, enhancing the effectiveness of clinical treatment as well as minimizing ethical risks."

However, their performance degrades significantly in reverberant environments: DOA estimation struggles to distinguish the direct path from strong reflections, while source extraction fails to effectively exploit the spatial cues in early reflections. This paper proposes a novel formulation of the source array-manifold vector (AMV) as a linear combination of free-field AMVs corresponding to the direct path and the four first-order reflections from the surrounding walls. A neural network is developed to jointly estimate the DOA and the combination weights of these component AMVs. The resulting composite AMV is then used in a minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer for enhanced source extraction. Additionally, we introduce a location-based training strategy that enables end-to-end learning to automatically identify the direct-path direction. Simulation results show that the proposed method significantly improves both speech quality and DOA estimation accuracy in reverberant environments."

    "abstract": "We propose a zero-bit watermarking method to protect convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Deep learning models are valuable intellectual property, so protecting them is critical. Specifically, since CNNs are often reused through finetuning, it is essential to be able to robustly extract the watermark even after fine-tuning. However, conventional watermarking methods have faced challenges, such as potentially degrading the model's performance due to watermark embedding and being vulnerable to fine-tuning. In contrast, our proposed method is based on the Associative Watermarking Method (AWM). As a zero-bit watermarking approach, our AWM-based method associates a watermark with the CNN model without degrading its performance. Additionally, the error correction capability of AWM allows it to handle feature degradation. An important aspect of our method is selecting features extracted from the CNN model. We use the weights of the convolutional layers as features and convert them to binary before inputting them into the AWM. We confirmed that our method enables error-free extraction of watermarks from eight different CNN models under non-attack conditions. To demonstrate the robustness of our method, we evaluated its performance against fine-tuning. Our computer simulations showed that complete watermark extraction was possible even when models pre-trained on ImageNet were finetuned using the CIFAR-100 dataset. These results show that our method maintains its protective capabilities even when significant modifications are made, such as fine-tuning."

    "abstract": "We address the problem of Hankel Structured LowRank Approximation (HSLRA) using the Variable Projection (VP) method, which has been explored in signal processing tasks such as denoising and spectral estimation. A notable issue in VPbased HSLRA is its sensitivity to initialization, particularly under noisy conditions. We identify a phenomenon termed singular value switching, where the singular vector associated with the smallest singular value may not best reflect the true signal structure due to noise-induced perturbations. To mitigate this, we propose two initialization strategies: (M1) selecting among multiple singular vectors based on VP objective evaluation, and (M2) incorporating random linear combinations of singular vectors to expand the candidate set. Numerical experiments on exponentially decaying sinusoidal signals demonstrate that the proposed methods enhance reconstruction accuracy and robustness compared to conventional VP initialization."

Although current detection models demonstrate impressive performance, they struggle to maintain effectiveness against constantly evolving deepfake attacks. Additionally, continually fine-tuning these models using historical training data incurs substantial computational and storage costs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that incorporates Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) into audio deepfake detection, enabling models to retain knowledge of historical spoofing distribution without direct access to past data. Our method integrates UAP seamlessly with pre-trained self-supervised audio models during fine-tuning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing its potential as an efficient solution for continual learning in audio deepfake detection."

Traditional spatiotemporal methods suffer from high computational complexity, while single time-series models inadequately capture spatial correlations. This paper presents GPR-MRF-K, a novel hybrid approach integrating Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Markov Random Field-enhanced Kriging (MRF-K) for rapid field prediction. GPR handles temporal dependencies and uncertainty quantification, while MRF-K enables efficient spatial interpolation through neighborhood structure optimization, reducing computational complexity from <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{O}\\left(\\mathrm{N}^{3}\\right)$</tex> to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{O}\\left(\\mathrm{n}^{3}\\right)$</tex>. Experimental validation using a 12 -sensor ammonia leakage model demonstrates that GPR-MRF-K achieves 67 % lower mean square error compared to LSTM-based methods and traditional Kriging, with an average prediction time of 37 seconds. The approach shows significant potential for environmental monitoring, industrial safety, and emergency response applications requiring both accuracy and real-time performance."

This work provides a secure representation of the blockchain technology and incorporation of sophisticated iris recognition technology to allow a method of a secure and non-repudiable biometric identification in the cloud condition. With the help of the MMU Iris Dataset, comprising 460 datasets of iris images of 46 individuals, the proposed system will deploy the utilisation of the pre-processing methods that may involve segmentation, normalisation, and denoising to improve the quality of the images. Discriminative and compact feature vectors are produced by applying deep learning techniques such as InceptionV3 and classical Log-Gabor filters on feature extraction. To maintain confidentiality and integrity, these vectors are encrypted with the AES256 and hashed with the SHA-256. The hash-coded templates are subsequently enrolled and published on a permissioned block chain network with smart contracts to receive identity verification, admittance restrictions and withdrawal. With homomorphic encryption, biometric templates may be securely matched, without decryption and without breaching an end-to-end privacy. The proposed model reached the recognition accuracy of iris definition of 97.8%, which was much better than the recognized models of recognition such as ResNet50 (95.7%) and VGG16 (94.1%). The system also has a low encryption latency and has a high blockchain throughput (1200 TPS) which is scalable to the real world. This framework exhibits a combination of the benefits of biometric authentication and decentralization of blockchain, thus meeting both of the criteria of cloudbased identity management data security and trustworthiness. The proposed model can, therefore, offer a trusted, transparent and privacy-wise solution to nextgen biometric systems."

    "abstract": "With the development of mobile and positioning technologies, Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) have burgeoned. The Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation aims to predict users' potential POI visits through their check-in trajectories. Traditional techniques have progressed but suffer limitations, such as high computational resource consumption and a lack of semantic understanding of check-in data. Prompt length limitations and insufficient logical reasoning also constrain related studies leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper proposes an LLMs-driven Multi-Agent algorithm generation framework for the next POI recommendation (LMAPOI) to address these issues. It utilizes different agents to mine features of movement patterns and individual preferences from raw data, respectively. Subsequently, the new features are aggregated to formulate a scoring function for POIs. Finally, we require LLMs to search for new options in terms of ideas and parameters to obtain a more accurate function. This approach prevents LLMs from directly processing massive data, deepens the model's semantic understanding of check-in behaviors and problem objectives, and employs a dual strategy to fully utilize the algorithms generated by LLMs, enabling dynamic adjustment of POI recommendations. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms multiple baseline methods, showcasing remarkable superiority."

The modified dynamic-weight Dijkstra algorithm that adaptively adjusts road costs using real-time traffic assessment (e.g., congestion, construction) is designed to make path plan.

Furthermore, a three-phase induction motor is a common driving engine in industry. For induction motors to operate at their peak efficiency, speed sensorless control is therefore required. A discrete disturbance observer is used in this work to provide input on the speed sensorless control. This method uses a discrete PI controller that is tuned using the Ziegler-Nichols and Cohen-Coon methods. The goal of this research is to compare the Ziegler Nichols and Cohen-Coon tuning methods for the speed sensorless control scheme with torque load variation utilising a discrete PI. For this investigation, an Alliance AY3A-90L4 induction motor was used in an experimental setting. The results show that the Cohen-Coon tuning method is better under parameter efficiency and robustness against disturbance and Ziegler-Nichols is better under parameter reliability."

A unified system that jointly cancels undesired noise and synthesizes a binaural audio effect using a loudspeaker array is proposed. To design the ANC controller, we explore two approaches: a model-based approach based on the underdetermined multichannel inverse filtering and a learningbased approach utilizing the fully-convolutional time-domain audio separation network (Conv-TasNet). For the XTC, the frequency-domain underdetermined multichannel inverse filtering (FUMIF) approach is employed for the design of the inverse filters. The outputs from both subsystems are then merged to cancel the primary noise while preserving a binaural effect for the listener. The results of the study confirm the efficacy of the proposed system, demonstrating satisfactory noise reduction and binaural audio effects in several objective metrics."

Specifically, a case study is introduced in which an AI-based classifier is used to predict whether or not a student will achieve an ‘A’ grade (i.e., 90% or higher). To that, the XGBoost model and Shapley values are used to understand and assess the significance of each feature in the dataset. Afterwards, the Decision Tree model (which is inherently explainable) is used to further explore the importance of each feature in light of the Shapley values. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in quantifying the importance of the different dataset features, and the significance of these features on the decision accuracy. In particular, the most effective features in the dataset were shown to be the midterm grade followed by the high school grade, while the absence percentage showed lower importance on the prediction performance. Such explainable AI model can assist educators to efficiently utilize AI for student performance prediction by knowing which feature of the dataset is more effective on the model accuracy."

Unlike conventional grid-based approaches that suffer from quantization errors and require post-processing filters, 3D-GMT jointly refines all source locations in parallel, implicitly smoothing trajectories and reducing cumulative error. Simulation experiments in reverberant environments demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of 3D-GMT under two representative motion scenarios: straightline paths and complex spiral trajectories.

With product iteration rates and customization demands increasing daily, Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) have become the primary choice for many enterprises to cope with uncertain order requirements due to their strong adaptability and efficient, precise management capabilities. The formulation of FMS production plans directly determines the system's performance throughout the production process. However, existing research predominantly focuses on equipment and process levels, prioritizing efficiency and quality as optimization objectives, and passively addresses unexpected events during manufacturing through rescheduling methods. There is a lack of consideration for the synergistic relationship between human factors and system resilience, leading to improper allocation of worker workloads, constrained production capacity, and suboptimal operational statuses under disruptive scenarios. This paper addresses the FMS scheduling optimization problem by comprehensively integrating human factor constraints and system resilience modeling. We propose a multi-objective integrated optimization approach that proactively mitigates disturbances through rational workload allocation and process layout arrangements, thereby enhancing worker productivity."

    "abstract": "Road traffic congestion is a critical challenge in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), influencing road safety and the performance of vehicular communication networks. In 4G long-term evolution (LTE)-based vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) networks, the availability and efficiency of wireless channel resources are essential for transmitting safety-critical messages such as cooperative awareness messages (CAMs). We investigated the impact of road traffic congestion on 4G LTE V2V channel resource performance in a junction road environment using a simulation. For the simulation, we used the Veins framework, integrating simulation of urban mobility (SUMO), an objective modular network testbed in C++ (OMNeT++), simulation for LTE network (SimuLTE), and an internet networking framework (INET) to simulate real-world vehicular mobility and communication. The analysis was conducted using performance indicators such as throughput, packet delivery ratio (PDR), average travel time, average waiting time, and queueing time, under varying traffic densities and speeds. Results revealed that a higher vehicle density significantly affected throughput, showing a degradation of up to 28% when the number of vehicles increased from 75 to 250. Vehicles also require more time to reach their destinations and experience increased travel and waiting time, especially at lower speeds. For instance, all 250 vehicles arrived by 800 s at 20 km/h and 640 s at 110 km/h, with average travel times of 42.6 and 23.85 s, respectively. However, PDR and average queueing time remained stable across densities, indicating minimal sensitivity to congestion in those metrics. Overall, the results demonstrate that road traffic congestion degrades communication efficiency in 4G LTE V2V systems, particularly in terms of throughput and vehicular delays, underscoring the need for congestion-aware channel resource management in urban ITS deployments."

    "abstract": "Logs continuously record both normal and anomalous system operational states, serving as critical data for system runtime monitoring. Log anomaly detection facilitates system debugging and root cause analysis for issues such as system failures, shutdown faults, null pointer exceptions, illegal argument exceptions, and class cast exceptions. Deep learning has been widely adopted in log anomaly detection to enhance detection accuracy. However, deep learning models require substantial labeled log data, which demands significant human effort and time investment. To address this labeling requirement, pretraining models like BERT have been introduced. However, pretraining models introduce new challenges. BERT requires finetuning of an enormous parameter set, resulting in substantial training overhead. Existing parameter-efficient strategies in log anomaly detection degrade the performance while introducing inference latency through increased model depth. Furthermore, the continuous expansion of system scale generates exponentially growing log data containing redundant log information. Current random sampling methods for training data selection fail to filter more valuable instances and exacerbate data redundancy. To address these challenges, we propose a Log Anomaly Detection based on Active Learning and Prefix (LogAL-Prefix).

    "abstract": "Gestures are a key component of non-verbal communication in traffic, often helping pedestrian-to-driver interactions when formal traffic rules may be insufficient. This problem becomes more apparent when autonomous vehicles (AVs) struggle to interpret such gestures. In this study, we present a gesture classification framework using 2D pose estimation applied to real-world video sequences from the WIVW dataset. We categorise gestures into four primary classes (Stop, Go, Thank & Greet, and No Gesture) and extract 76 static and dynamic features from normalised keypoints. Our analysis demonstrates that hand position and movement velocity are especially discriminative in distinguishing between gesture classes, achieving a classification accuracy score of 87%. These findings not only improve the perceptual capabilities of AV systems but also contribute to the broader understanding of pedestrian behaviour in traffic contexts."

The primary pulse circuit features a fast overcurrent protection system for the 1.7 kV SiC-MOSFETs used. Standard differential current sensing can be limited by high di/dt transients, due to a common-mode voltage caused by parasitic inductances that may saturate the sensing comparator. To overcome this, a single-ended measurement concept was developed. This approach incorporates the parasitic inductance into the measurement path and uses a matched RC compensation network to counteract this effect. Initial measurements confirm the protection system achieves switch turn-off within 40 ns of an overcurrent event. This paper presents the circuit design, the overcurrent protection mechanism, and initial test results."

    "abstract": "Racetrack Memory (RTM), as a promising next-generation memory technology, offers high storage density and low access latency. It is a potential alternative to DRAM in main-memory applications. However, the data access pattern of RTM differs from traditional memory. Its “shift before access” characteristic presents challenges for efficient memory management and rapid data access. This article proposes a novel address remapping algorithm for RTM to improve data access efficiency in these contexts. By analyzing memory access locality and computing weights based on trace patterns, our method distributes data across multiple banks to reduce access contention caused by sequential access within a single bank. In addition, we introduce a workload balancing mechanism to achieve wear leveling, which further optimizes overall parallelism and reduces performance bottlenecks in the RTM storage system. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on 15 real-world SPEC2006 benchmarks, which demonstrates that address remapping reduces the number of shifts by 10.9 % and the total bank energy by 10.1 %. Furthermore, our strategy leads to a 10.2 % reduction in the average latency of single trace. These results highlight the potential of RTM in main-memory applications where low energy consumption and high throughput are crucial. Additionally, they illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in optimizing RTM performance for real-world, latency-sensitive workloads."

Although existing methods like Magnitude Least-Squares (MLS) can reduce overall errors by means of low-order representation of the head-related transfer functions (HRTFs), residual inaccuracies persist in contralateral regions. To address this limitation, we propose a directional hybrid optimization of HRTFs. This method partitions the space into contralateral, ipsilateral, and transition zones, and each zone is processed using least-squares, MLS, and their linear combination, respectively. Objective evaluation results using KU-100 HRTFs demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much higher performance across all objective metrics, suppressing rendering errors in contralateral source while improving spatial cue accuracy at lateral positions when compared with MLS. Subjective MUSHRA tests further confirm the superiority of the proposed method, with perceptual scores exceeding those of MLS by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 4 \\%}$</tex> at order <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$N=1$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{4 \\%}$</tex> at <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$N=4$</tex>.

With the increasing variety of AI algorithms available, selecting an effective MPPT solution remains a challenge. This paper proposes a Snow Ablation Optimizer (SAO)-based MPPT algorithm, a novel physics-inspired metaheuristic derived from the sublimation and melting behavior of snow and evaluates its performance under various PSC scenarios in MATLAB/Simulink. The proposed algorithm is compared against two established techniques– Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO)–using two key metrics: success rate (SR) in locating the global maximum power point (GMPP) and convergence speed (CS). The overall performance is assessed using a performance indicator (PI) score that balances both metrics. Results show that PSO achieves the highest PI score of 0.564, followed by GWO at 0.500, while SAO records 0.446. Although SAO ranks third, its potential for improvement remains significant, supporting the No Free Lunch Theorem, which implies that no single optimization algorithm performs best in all scenarios."

    "abstract": "Background: Obesity has become a rising threat in the globe when it comes to the heart failure especially heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The problematic aspect of the HFpEF diagnosis among the obese individuals is the presence of the overlapping symptoms, which occur, and the traditional diagnostic measures also have lesser functionality. They are particularly sharp in the low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs), where the high-level diagnostics is not readily accessible. Newly developed Artificial Intelligence (AI) especially machine learning and deep learning are the answer to these barriers.Methods: The given literature review is a summary of six articles (20192024) which have been published in peer-reviewed journals following a specific database search. Articles that have reported on the gaps in the diagnosing of obese patients with HF or studies that have experimented with AI-based solutions to diagnose HF were included. Results analysis was used to explore the themes.Findings: Echocardiography, electrocardiography (ECG), and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) are not sensitive in obese patients because of the anatomical and metabolic differences. The solutions of the AIs particularly the solutions used in the echocardiographic and ECG data had high diagnostic accuracy, failure to respond to the poor inputs, and the capability to detect the disease early. In addition, AI-based risk stratification and decision support systems were also prospective in the LMICs in which the diagnostic facilities are insufficient.Interpretation: The problem of heart failure diagnostics in obese populations can be resolved with the help of artificial intelligence since it represents a scalable and cost-effective method of handling the problem. Its incorporation into clinical pathways can decrease the underdiagnosis, advance equity, and achieve the maximum outcome. The future of the cardiovascular diagnostics and cardiovascular care could be made more affordable, more precise and fairer in the future with the help of the AI-enhanced and echocardiography analysis software integrated into the LMIC healthcare and primary care systems."

In this study, we discuss a new approach to study thyroid diseases utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification and Backpropagation Neural Networks (BPNNs) for classifying datasets. Our dataset of thyroid images includes images collected via ultrasound, MRI, and CT scans. Each image is associated with the relevant thyroid disease category including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, thyroid nodules, etc. In addition, the data was comprised of non-image features that included patient demographics, symptoms, and medical history. For classifying the images, we reviewed an architecture based on CNNs, which can automatically learn important attributes of the thyroid images. The CNN model has been trained using a labeled image dataset taking advantage of the convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction, followed by fully connected layers for classification. A BPNN architecture has been created to classify the dataset and assess the subject in relation to non-image attributes associated with a thyroid disease. The BPNN is trained using back propagation, and by doing so, it learns the underlying patterns and relationships between a wide range of features, and the associated disease categories. The predictions have been drawn together and presented as a single system to assess the thyroid disease. The overall predictions were compiled using ensemble learning methods from the CNN and BPNN models, and the subsequent predictions improved the overall classification accuracy. The ability of the described system was assessed using non-overlapping test datasets, using measures of accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score and area under the ROC curve (AUC). The system was also validated against the domain experts, to ensure clinical usefulness and reliability. The outcome demonstrated the potential of integrating CNN's and BPNN's for a comprehensive evaluation of thyroid disease, providing a promising approach for accurate and reliable diagnosis in clinical practice."

The study involves simulation of a data transmission system based on self-orthogonal codes and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). The focus is placed on a comparative performance analysis of MTD versus other error correction methods, such as LDPC and turbo codes, under various modulation schemes (QPSK, 8PSK, 16APSK). Evaluation was conducted using ITU-R Outdoor Channel A and SCM Urban Macro channel models, considering different noise levels, receiver speeds, and fading parameters. The results show that MTD not only provides high performance comparable to other methods but also significantly reduces computational complexity, which is critical for mobile devices with limited processing resources.

Key structural components—such as Exam Number, Student ID, and Page Number—are localized using YOLOv8 object detection. The answer region is then identified and cropped for analysis. Template matching is employed to detect landmark points, enabling precise alignment of the answer grid. Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) is performed using a Cross-Linear Area (CLA) algorithm, which calculates the ratio of dark pixels within each marker region to determine marked responses.

The framework incorporates the ML prediction module which includes Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT), to predict short-term power demand degradation rates. These estimates are used by a dueling Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning agent so that proactive and degradation awareness control choices are possible. Standard driving cycles (including UDDS, HWFET and NEDC) were used to evaluate performance as well as against various rule-based control, standalone ML or standalone RL comparison strategies. A prediction accuracy of 97.23% (90.57) was obtained in foreseeing demand and degradation measurement which led to considerable advantages in terms of operations: hydrogen consumption (12-18 % reduction), battery state-of-charge (SOC) stability (reduction up to 45%) and average degradation rate (reduction by 34 %). Compared to advanced standalone RL techniques, the fuel economy improvements varied between 8-17%. The combination of adaptive policy learning with predictive modeling enables the system to proactively consider the operating condition that gives rise to a high-stress state to adjust the power allocation thus extending the components lifetime that enhances efficiency.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in speech synthesis have enabled large language model (LLM)-based systems to perform zero-shot generation with controllable content, timbre, speaker identity, and emotion through input prompts. As a result, these models heavily rely on prompt design to guide the generation process. However, existing prompt selection methods often fail to ensure that prompts contain sufficiently stable speaker identity cues and appropriate emotional intensity indicators, which are crucial for expressive speech synthesis. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage prompt selection strategy specifically designed for expressive speech synthesis. In the static stage (before synthesis), we first evaluate prompt candidates using pitch-based prosodic features, perceptual audio quality, and text-emotion coherence scores evaluated by an LLM. We further assess the candidates under a specific TTS model by measuring character error rate, speaker similarity, and emotional similarity between the synthesized and prompt speech. In the dynamic stage (during synthesis), we use a textual similarity model to select the prompt that is most aligned with the current input text. Experimental results demonstrate that our strategy effectively selects prompt to synthesize speech with both high-intensity emotional expression and robust speaker identity, leading to more expressive and stable zero-shot TTS performance. Audio samples and codes will be available at https://whyrrrrun.github.io/ExpPro.github.io/."

To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end (E2E) method that integrates VAD and SER using Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) features. By jointly training both VAD and SER models with SSL features for a combined loss function, our approach enables the VAD module to capture emotional speech segments for SER, while making the SER model robust against the flawed VAD output. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that our proposed method improves SER performance without optimizing the VAD threshold. Furthermore, we analyze our method under various conditions, such as different loss weights and noise levels."

To address this issue, a novel probabilistic language-aware speech recognition is developed through a parameter-efficient learning where the tunable adapters are configured in a frozen Whisper backbone. In particular, this study incorporates a language-aware calibrator at the prediction stage, introducing the language identity as an additional condition for next token prediction. By merging such a language awareness in conditional generation, the model's ability to distinguish between languages in a code-switching speech is significantly improved. The results on Chinese-English code-switching dataset using SEAME show a 4.9% relative improvement in mixed error rate by using the proposed method with only 5.1% fine-tuned parameters relative to a strong baseline with full fine-tuned parameters."

    "abstract": "Speech quality assessment (SQA) refers to the evaluation of speech quality, and developing an accurate automatic SQA method that reflects human perception has become increasingly important, in order to keep up with the generative AI boom. In recent years, SQA has progressed to a point that researchers started to faithfully use automatic SQA in research papers as a rigorous measurement of goodness for speech generation systems. We believe that the scientific challenges and open-source activities of late have stimulated the growth in this field. In this paper, we review recent challenges as well as open-source implementations and toolkits for SQA, and highlight the importance of maintaining such activities to facilitate the development of not only SQA itself but also generative AI for speech."

This method formulates the acoustic potential energy of the residual signals over the region into spherical/cylindrical-harmonics coefficients (also named as ’wave-domain coefficients’), and further decomposes it into three components related to the coherence between reference signals at the reference microphones and primary signals over the region, filter coefficients, and an uncontrollable term due to physical and practical constraints.

Recently, a two-stage DNNbased framework has been used to generate preprocessed signals for distortion-free speech restoration, where a preprocessing network is cascaded with a frozen forward model that estimates the PAL system. However, the preprocessing network can exploit weaknesses in the fixed model, resulting in adversarial outputs. To address this, we propose a joint optimization strategy based on a PAL-driven generative adversarial network (PALGAN), which simultaneously learns the PAL process and the preprocessing module. A process discrimination mechanism is incorporated into the discriminator, enabling it to determine whether the input signal pair conform to the PAL process while acquiring a forward model. The generator uses a causal TF-GridNet to estimate the real and imaginary parts of the preprocessed signal via a time-frequency band-split mechanism. Simulated and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive reconstruction performance when compared with existing methods across various objective metrics<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>For access to the source code and speech samples, please visit: https://github.com/MWY0615/PALGAN.."

Many high-power pulsed applications favour laser-triggered gas switches for their repeatable trigger characteristics and ability to achieve a high degree of synchronism due to low jitter. Some studies have additionally suggested that a certain degree of per-switch controllability may be achieved through modification of the laser parameters alone, while other have begun to explore the characteristics and breakdown mechanisms of ultra-short-pulse (picosecond, femtosecond) laser triggering for enhanced switching performance. The interaction between lasers and gas is rich in fundamental physics, much of which remains poorly understood, particularly within the context of laser-triggered switches for pulsed power. This work presents preliminary results achieved from ab-initio modelling of laser-gas interactions conducted with the aim to estimate laser ionisation rates in various simple gases. A custom implementation of the split-operator spectral method to solve the Schrödinger equation for electronic wavefunctions under laser perturbations is presented, enabling calculations, from first-principles, of laser ionisation probabilities and rates as functions of various optical parameters of the laser pulse and working gas.

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "High-voltage solid-state pulse generators are widely used for driving transient plasma reactors, where rectangular pulses with nanosecond rise and fall times are essential for efficient discharge control. Capacitive plasma loads present a major challenge: after turn-off, the low load current causes slow switch commutation and extended fall times. Conventional fall-time control in capacitive plasma loads typically relies on passive dummy loads, which accelerate switch turn-off but cause significant power losses, or an auxiliary high-voltage switch in a half-bridge configuration, which increases cost and system complexity. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a compact single-switch module with an active dummy load and energy recovery. In this method, energy is stored in an inductor during the pulse and released after turn-off to charge an output capacitor, thereby reducing the fall time while recovering energy back into the circuit. By employing a high-voltage switch topology based on capacitive coupling and gate boosting, the rise time is significantly reduced. A 10 kV prototype demonstrates nanosecond-scale rise and fall times with substantially lower power dissipation compared to passive methods. The proposed approach combines efficiency, simplicity, and scalability, enabling precise high-repetition-rate plasma pulse generation with improved overall performance."

Recent studies increasingly utilize n-best hypothesis lists as inputs to post-processing models. While much of the existing research focuses on improving model architectures, we observe that the composition of the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$n$</tex>-best list itself can significantly impact post-processing outcomes. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various speech-related tasks, often outperforming traditional methods. Although some studies have explored the use of LLMs for ASR post-processing, these efforts have primarily focused on selecting the hypothesis with the lowest error rate or directly correcting recognition errors. In this paper, we focus on the task of hypothesis set refinement (HSR)-selecting a high-quality subset of hypotheses from the original candidate list to better support downstream processing. We propose a novel LLM-based HSR method that leverages the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs to select a more informative, diverse, and error-tolerant hypothesis set. This refined set facilitates subsequent post-processing methods such as reranking and error correction. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on two widely used ASR benchmarks: AISHELL-1 and LibriSpeech. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of LLMs to directly perform reranking and correction, demonstrating how LLMs can be effectively employed throughout the ASR post-processing pipeline to enhance overall system performance."

But most face authentication devices can be tricked by replay assaults, attacks using 3D masks, and other types of attacks. So, face anti-spoofing algorithms are becoming more important in these systems. Deep learning has recently come on the scene and done quite well on hard computer vision problems. This proposed model suggests a new Multi-Modal Transformer-Guided Face Anti-Spoofing (MTFAS) framework that uses depth and texture signals from RGB and auxiliary data streams to deal with these attacks and make biometric authentication more secure. A Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone with Cross-Modal Attention Fusion (CMAF) is at the heart of this technique. It lets the model accurately detect spoofing by capturing extremely fine spatial, context-specific, and modality-specific data. Many tests on benchmark data sets such as CASIA-FASD, Replay-Attack, and OULU-NPU show that MTFAS is better at finding both 2D and 3D attacks than the best approaches that are currently available. It is more generalizable and robust across datasets."

The manual identification of the footprint using traditional methods is time-consuming, and too subjective, and may be error-prone in difficult terrain or poor lighting environments. This study suggests a smart, learning aided digital picture processing method that classifies animal footprints, which is a combination of a hybrid and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with GradientBoosting approaches. The pipeline of the system consists of standardized preprocessing procedure (resizing, grayscale to color conversion, CLAHE, noise removal), morphological segmentation procedure (Otsu thresholding, Canny edge detection), and fine-tuned feature extraction (Histogram of Oriented Gradients, Zernike moments, and VGG16 deep features). The hybrid model involving CNN feature embeddings and Gradient Boosting classifiers is utilized to conduct classification allowing improving interpretability and generalization. Tests on the Roboflow Animal Footprints dataset show it performs better on a wide array of species, types of substrates, and noise levels. The hybrid model produced an overall classification accuracy of 95.62% which were better compared to existing standalone models along with the hybrid models, SVM (85.60%), CNN (92.48%), and other two hybrids CNN-SVM (93.05%). The framework also achieved good robustness across different substrates (accuracy range 86.3% to 95.1 %) and noise density (accuracy >83.6 % up to moderate noise). Such findings show the consistency and flexibility of the model in implementing the real environment ecological conditions. The system could be implemented in portable wildlife tracking device, mobile application, or distant sensing systems. This work offers a considerable step toward fully automated animal tracking with the least human interaction and maximum accuracy that will allow designing modern, scalable, and AI-enhanced conservation planning."

This paper introduces MapCVAE, a new model based on Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE), which predicts multiple possible future paths. By integrating semantic map information, MapCVAE produces contextually appropriate trajectories and captures diverse intentions such as changing direction or stopping. Experiments show that MapCVAE significantly outperforms conventional deterministic models in predicting diverse pedestrian behaviors.

However, there are still relatively few studies on modeling and analysis based on the actual load characteristics of self-lubricating bearings. This paper focuses on the coupled variable load conditions that selflubricating bearings actually endure and conducts modeling and numerical simulation analysis of aviation self-lubricating bearings. First, a finite element model of the self-lubricating bearing was established based on the structure of the aviation self-lubricating bearing, and the effectiveness of the constructed finite element model was verified under pure radial load. Then, the contact stress of the self-lubricating lining was analyzed using the finite element model. Finally, the wear process of the self-lubricating bearing was simulated based on the statics of the self-lubricating bearing finite element model and the UMESHMOTION subroutine. This study can provide a certain theoretical basis for the prediction of wear amount and wear analysis of self-lubricating bearings in aviation."

    "abstract": "A modified Laser Induced Fluorescence Dip (LIF-Dip) diagnostic [1] is applied to study the time evolution of plasma parameters of a cathode plasma during the extraction of a pulsed electron beam by an external electrical field. Plasma parameters are estimated from measurements of the spatial electric field distribution around a small conductive probe submerged in the bulk of the cathode plasma. It is well known that the disturbance of the plasma due to the probe is screened out by the formation of a plasma sheath, a region of space charge imbalance which extends in Debye length scale towards the undisturbed plasma. The sheath's characteristics, plasma potential and spatial field distribution, are determined exclusively by the plasma parameters of the local unperturbed plasma. The plasma parameters are obtained by matching the measured electric field distribution to the field resulting from the numerical solution of the Poisson equation. The space charge density in the Poisson equation is described by the plasma parameters, which are varied in an iterative process until an optimal fit with the measurement is achieved. The measured cathode plasma parameters at different stages of the discharge and under different pulsed electron source regimes are presented."

Experimental findings yielded high prediction accuracy compared with traditional models, performing better as far as accuracy is concerned and increasing transparency.

    "abstract": "Operational amplifiers (op-amps) are essential components in modern electronic systems, and their long-term reliability is crucial for maintaining consistent performance. Among various performance metrics, input offset voltage (VOS) is particularly sensitive to aging and serves as a key indicator of reliability degradation. This degradation stems from time- and temperature-dependent threshold voltage mismatches in input CMOS transistors, driven by thermally activated mechanisms governed by the Arrhenius law. Consequently, VOS degradation can follow bidirectional trajectories, deviating from the typical monotonic aging behavior. Traditional unidirectional degradation models fail to capture this behavior, often leading to inaccurate and physically inconsistent reliability predictions. This paper proposes a novel reliability modeling framework for op-amps that explicitly accounts for bidirectional VOS degradation. It includes a detailed analysis of stress-induced degradation mechanisms, with transistor aging rates quantitatively modeled using the Arrhenius equation to reflect thermally accelerated failures. The model is validated through representative case studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in quantitatively evaluating the reliability of op-amps with bidirectional VOS degradation. The results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively captures the bidirectional degradation behavior of op-amps, offering accurate and physically grounded reliability predictions."

Research has shown that the brick, as the fundamental discharge unit of the LTD, greatly influences the system's weight and volume due to its power density. This paper proposes an ultra-compact brick based on a switch array and an all-solid-state pulse forming network. The main switch module is formed by packaging an array of series and parallel Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) bare dies, offering high power density and low parasitic inductance. A pulse forming network, composed of multilayer ceramic capacitors and printed circuit board(PCB)-clad inductors, is integrated with the switch module on the same PCB to construct the ultra-compact brick. The brick is capable of delivering an output of 10 kV, with a 24 ns rise time and a 75 ns pulse width when matched with a 12Ω load. Additionally, a core reset circuit is designed to enhance the effective magnetic flux density of the nanocrystalline core, reducing the size of the magnetic core of SSLTD. The system also integrates a high-voltage charging power supply and synchronized driver circuitry for bricks. In the final test, a 30 -stage SSLTD was assembled, with four bricks connected in parallel per stage. The system successfully generated a 279 kV pulse output at a 90Ω impedance, with a rise time of 22.8 ns, a pulse width of 77 ns, and a repetition frequency capability of 100 Hz.

Extensive experiments on S&P 500 and NIFTY 50 data demonstrate that the implemented techniques effectively uncover Granger-causal relationships, yielding significant improvements, up to 82%, in predictive performance for the multivariate feature-set. Successful implementation of a diverse range of techniques further confirms that the proposed causal detection framework provides a scalable, domain-agnostic approach to causal feature extraction."

However, the black-box nature of existing predictive models limits their acceptance in operational decision-making contexts, creating an urgent need for transparent, cost-effective, and reliable forecasting solutions. Here, we propose a novel framework that combines Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS)-based ocean sensors with an interpretable machine learning approach to address this need. Utilizing two months of data collected from a MEMS accelerometer array on submarine cables, our approach integrates Variational Modal Decomposition (VMD) to isolate key temporal patterns from raw sensor measurement data, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to optimize feature selection. These refined features with meteorological and calendar information are fed into an interpretable machine learning model, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), for sea level prediction. The TFT provides interpretable outputs, including the importance ranking of input variables and attention distribution of different time steps. Our hybrid VMD-PCA-TFT model achieved a root mean square error of 1.57 cm and a coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.98 compared to tide gauge records, outperforming existing models. These results demonstrate that MEMS-based ocean measurement systems can match the accuracy of traditional methods at a fraction of the cost. Moreover, the TFT’s interpretable analysis reveals that the VMD-PCA features accounted for more than 80% predictive power, provide transparent insights into prediction mechanisms. This dual advantage of cost-effectiveness and interoperability of our framework could potentially promote widespread deployment of ocean monitoring systems and advance prediction capabilities for climate change adaptation."

Terahertz (THz) time-of-flight tomography method can characterize the sample’s internal structure and defect morphology, making it an ideal technique for PE pipe detection. However, tomography produces images contaminated by noise and artifacts resembling defects, resulting from the pipe’s geometry. Conventional detection algorithms often perform poorly under these conditions, leading to misinterpretations. To solve the challenge of detecting rotationally invariant defects in PE pipes, like circular holes, we propose a complete, physics-informed, and data-efficient framework for THz tomography image quality evaluation. First, the PE pipe THz tomography images are reconstructed using the time-of-flight method. Second, a physical information guided multi-template matching method is adopted to pre-screen defect images. Next, an asynchronous and independent whale optimization algorithm is employed to adaptively determine the optimal multi-template threshold combination. Finally, the optimal defect image is selected based on the composite image evaluation indicator. The experimental results show that the proposed method can select clear, well-defined, and low-noise defect tomography images, enhancing defect detection accuracy."

    "abstract": "Ensemble datasets are ever more prevalent in various scientific domains. In climate science, ensemble datasets are used to capture variability in projections under plausible future conditions including greenhouse and aerosol emissions. Each ensemble model run produces projections that are fundamentally similar yet meaningfully distinct. Understanding this variability among ensemble model runs and analyzing its magnitude and patterns is a vital task for climate scientists. In this paper, we present ClimateSOM, a visual analysis workflow that leverages a self-organizing map (SOM) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to support interactive exploration and interpretation of climate ensemble datasets. The workflow abstracts climate ensemble model runs—spatiotemporal time series—into a distribution over a 2D space that captures the variability among the ensemble model runs using a SOM. LLMs are integrated to assist in sensemaking of this SOM-defined 2D space, the basis for the visual analysis tasks. In all, ClimateSOM enables users to explore the variability among ensemble model runs, identify patterns, compare and cluster the ensemble model runs. To demonstrate the utility of ClimateSOM, we apply the workflow to an ensemble dataset of precipitation projections over California and the Northwestern United States. Furthermore, we conduct a short evaluation of our LLM integration, and conduct an expert review of the visual workflow and the insights from the case studies with six domain experts to evaluate our approach and its utility."

To address this problem, a robust cardinalized probability hypothesis density filter for acoustic SLAM based on variational Bayesian algorithm and unscented Kalman filter (UK-RCPHD ASLAM) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the direction of arrival (DoA) observations and the number of sound sources are modeled as a random finite set. Then, the bearing-only source states are estimated using the Gaussian mixture cardinalized probability hypothesis density (CPHD) filter, where the state update with nonlinear observations is completed by the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). Next, the CPHD posterior likelihood is approximated using variational Bayesian algorithm. Finally, the number and location of sound sources as well as the robot’s trajectory are jointly estimated based on the proposed UK-RCPHD ASLAM. The proposed method has good localization performance and strong robustness against non-Gaussian outliers. Additionally, it does not require complex data association process and can adapt to changes in the number of sound sources. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Unlike prior methods that treat reuse in isolation, HyShare jointly optimizes both reuse types, addressing their interdependencies while maintaining image fidelity. To prevent artifacts caused by stale data and correlation, we introduce per-pixel validation and dynamic refresh mechanisms. Our system adaptively disables reuse in motion-sensitive regions using radiance and geometric change checks. Evaluated on complex dynamic scenes, HyShare outperforms state-of-the-art baselines-including ReSTIR DI, ReSTIR PT, and Area ReSTIR-improving rendering speed by  37.4% and boosting image quality (PSNR +1.8 dB, SSIM +0.17). These results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of HyShare in advancing real-time photorealistic rendering."

    "abstract": "A high-performance computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system enhances diagnostic accuracy, enabling early detection and treatment. However, limited medical image datasets and low-quality augmentation methods hinder training, affecting CAD performance. Data augmentation increases training data but introduces augmentation leaks, where distortions in augmented images appear in generated outputs. Maintaining invertibility in augmentation can prevent leaks, but ensuring this across various generative adversarial networks (GANs) and datasets remains challenging. Additionally, existing high-resolution image generation models rely on complex deep neural networks, making optimization difficult and leading to issues like blurred lesion boundaries and poor detection of micro-leakage and micro-vessels. To address these challenges, we propose quantum transformer learning (QTL) for high-resolution medical image generation with prevention to mitigate augmentation leaks. The QTL generator enhances detail generation in high-resolution images while the prairie dog optimization (PDO) algorithm is combined with the activation function to accelerate the model convergence. Furthermore, an auxiliary multi-head neural network (AMH-NN) classifies the augmentation process during GAN training, guiding the model to avoid generating images with unintended distortions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated using the knee osteoarthritis and medical MNIST datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly reduces augmentation leaks and achieves superior image quality, attaining the lowest FID scores compared to state-of-the-art GAN models. The proposed QTL+AMH-NN model achieves 22.4% improvement in FID values for the Knee Osteoarthritis dataset and 18.6% enhancement for the Medical MNIST dataset compared to previous approaches. The most notable gain is observed in Breast-MRI (86.3%), demonstrating the model’s capability to generate high-quality medical images with minimal augmentation artifacts."

Combining the global and local confidence level conditions with our two early termination conditions, namely the local early termination condition and the global maximal RANSAC interaction round constraint, it can achieve the best compromise between matching accuracy and time for different inlier rate cases. Finally, we apply the weighted SVD-based method to estimate the global model solution. Based on 873 testing image pairs, comprehensive experimental results have justified the matching accuracy and execution time merits of our algorithm relative to the state-of-the-art methods."

Numerical results show DR–PDA achieves low total cost, reduced leakage and attack success, modest per-epoch runtime and a small optimality gap; ablations confirm the Wasserstein–CVaR correction is critical for tail safety, while removing modeled authentication delay lowers cost but markedly increases leakage, illustrating the latency–security trade-off."

    "abstract": "Research on vacuum electron device (VED)-based high-power terahertz (THz) source has attracted considerable attention worldwide due to its potential of high-power generation suitable for highresolution imaging, spectroscopy, and next-generation wireless communication systems. VED based sources such as backward wave oscillator (BWO) can be developed with a compact size and can deliver high power to be well-suited for on field applications. A VED based high-power source has three major components namely; an electron beam source, a interaction structure, and a spent beam collector. In this paper we have focused on the most pivotal component of the source i.e., interaction structure. At higher frequency range such as G-band, the size of the interaction structure becomes extremely small and any deviation in the dimensions can significantly degrade the performance of the source. This emphasises the requirement of precise control over the fabrication process. Along the same lines, this study presents a comparative investigation between two distinct tool path strategies - contour and hatching used during the micro-milling fabrication process. The studies present the effect of different tool paths on the dimensions and surface roughness of the developed interaction structure. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) characterization results accounts for dimensional deviation in the range of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\pm 20$</tex> microns and the average surface roughness as measured by ZETA 3D optical profilometer accounts for a relative difference of 200 nm between both the tool path strategies. The findings provide valuable insights into the optimization of micro-milling strategies for fabricating high-precision THz interaction structures. The study underscores the importance of selecting an appropriate tool path to enhance fabrication accuracy and surface quality, ultimately contributing to the advancement of high-power VED-based THz sources."

    "abstract": "The coherent, spatial-temporal dynamic structure observed in a liquid anode of atmospheric DC glow discharge was found to drive an intricate surface deformation and mechanical wave at the plasma-liquid interface. The surface topography shares the same geometry with the plasma pattern and it was assumed that the surface distortion enables an autocatalytic process where the uneven profile may seed the non-uniform distribution for space charge to form the self-organized pattern. To verify this assumption, the surface elevation map at the plasma-liquid interface was measured for the first time using the reflective laser speckle background-oriented schlieren technique. This work shows that the surface deformation is acted on by the Coulomb forces derived from nonuniform net-negative surface charge at the liquid anode. Various operating parameters affect the pattern and surface waves by changing the gas heating and charge relaxation time. In their temporal evolutions, the plasma pattern is fully established before the surface waves. Statistically, plasma pattern and surface wave both have constant phase velocity indicating a non-dispersive nature. These results suggest that the surface deformation does not participate in an autocatalytic process and the neutral gas mass flow boosted by thermal convection could lead to the development of patterns."

By closely coupling sub-Marxes, the jitter between sub-Marxes within a single Marx tank becomes a small fraction of the pulse width and does not affect the total Marx output.

    "abstract": "Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is an important disinfection technology. UV light with a wavelength of 222 nm is very safe for the human body as it cannot penetrate the stratum corneum of the skin or the tear film layer on the eye surface. It also provides better inactivation effects on microorganisms compared with other ultraviolet wavelengths and thus offers an excellent disinfection effect with minimal human body damage. The discharge process in a chlorine-doped krypton (Kr/Cl) gas atmosphere can produce KrCl excimers, whose state transition emits ultraviolet light with a wavelength of 222 nm, making Kr/Cl gas discharge tubes ideal 222 nm UV light sources. Generally, nanosecond pulse discharge features high active particle density, and compared to AC or DC discharge, its energy conversion to molecular excited states is more efficient. However, the discharge evolution process of the Kr/Cl system driven by nanosecond voltage pulse is not yet fully understood. This research constructs a fluid model to simulate a 222 nm excimer lamp with a plate-plate structure. By applying nanosecond pulse voltage and varying the plate gap, voltage amplitude, and gas composition, we explore the reaction mechanism and factors influencing the average intensity of 222 nm ultraviolet light under nanosecond pulse, aiming to identify ultraviolet lamp design parameters with maximum radiation efficiency. This study helps quantitatively optimize KrCl UV lamp design, enhancing 222 nm radiation efficiency and its disinfection effectiveness."

Traditional classification methods are difficult to meet the classification requirement of complex power quality disturbances (PQDs). In this paper, a complex power quality disturbance classification method based on fuzzy transfer field and shallow double-path neural network is proposed. Fuzzy transfer field is a conversion scheme proposed to solve the confusion problem in the process of amplitude-dependent signal transformation in the existing mainstream dimension conversion methods. Fuzzy idea is used to blur the specific coordinates of signal points, and precisely encode the timing relationship and distribution of signal points, so that it can effectively encode the timing relationship and distribution information of signals. It can retain the features well in the process of downsampling; Shallow double path neural network is realized by referring to shallow residual network model and using double path neural network modular fast combination stack. Simulation and experiments show that the proposed method can effectively solve the confusion problem of dimension conversion schemes, and can achieve accurate and rapid identification of complex power quality disturbances with an accuracy of 98.13%."

To our best knowledge, the proposed method is the first to aim to reversibly process HDR images. The proposed method has been designed accounting for the structure of OpenEXR images in order to ensure reversibility. Thus, we first convert the pixel values in floating-point format to signed integers and then carry out the respective processing in signed integer format. Additionally, restoration data, which is information necessary to restore the original form, is embedded into the image itself, resulting in derivation of the output image. Our method has achieved six types of image processing with full reversibility and flexible control of processing intensity. Experimental results demonstrate that each type of processing yields a significant effect, while the artifacts introduced by embedding restoration data remain visually negligible. These findings confirm the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed reversible HDR image processing method."

Residual Networks (ResNets) are very prone to perturbations that will mislead predictions without impacting the human-perceived content, even though they possess remarkable diagnostic accuracy. This approach is an adversarial defense system that is a hybrid of ResNet for training and input transformation and latent feature denoising to counter this problem. It was tested and validated on the MIMIC-CXR and NIH ChestX-ray14 datasets with a range of attack vectors, including FGSM, PGD, and DeepFool. The results of the experiment show an impressive boost in resilience over the baseline and current adversarial training techniques. Clean accuracy is above 96%, while the adversarial accuracies are above 89%. The steady CAM localization and consistent gradient alignment of the concept make it extremely intuitive. The proposed architecture offers a clinically sound, scalable, and strong alternative for the secure interpretation of medical reports."

To this end, this paper investigates a sectional voice anonymization method, which partitions the original utterance into sections and replaces the original speaker with distinct pseudo-speakers in each section. Subsequently, to align with the single pseudo-speaker requirement defined for anonymized speech, a detection algorithm is investigated to examine the presence of multiple pseudo-speakers in anonymized speech. Experimental results on the LibriSpeech dataset demonstrated that the sectional anonymization method was able to enhance voice privacy protection capability, and the presence of multiple pseudo-speakers in anonymized utterances can be detected.

    "abstract": "Epileptic seizure prediction is a critical challenge in clinical neuroscience, where early warnings can greatly improve patient safety and quality of life. Deep learning (DL) models have shown strong potential by automatically capturing spatiotemporal electroencephalogram (EEG) features, yet their large size and computational demands hinder deployment in real-time or resource-constrained settings. Traditional compression methods such as pruning and quantization reduce complexity but often degrade performance. In this study, we propose a teacher-student knowledge distillation (KD) framework, where a high-capacity 1D CNN-BiLSTM with attention teacher transfers its predictive power to a 1D CNN-BiGRU with attention lightweight student. The student reaches near-teacher accuracy (97% vs. 99%) while reducing parameters, compressing model size by 99%, and lowering inference latency by up to 69%. Unlike standard quantization methods, which trade either accuracy or compression, our KD approach achieves both extreme compactness with reliable accuracy and fast inference. These results highlight our framework as a practical solution for enabling real-time seizure prediction on Internet of Things (IoT) edge devices."

However, nearly 40 % of food production is lost due to fungal infections, posing a major challenge to food security. To address this issue, cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) technology is emerging as a promising, eco-friendly solution for agricultural and food processing applications. This study investigates the effects of CAP jet treatment on different types of seeds. A CAP jet system was designed and developed, along with its electrical and optical properties characterization. The characterization also includes power dissipation, dielectric capacitance, plasma plume temperature, and reactive species generation. Seed samples of wheat have been treated under different plasma exposure times. The seed treatment examinations have been carried out for direct CAP exposures to the seeds. The study analyzed the chemical and physical modifications of the seed surfaces at different operating conditions. Key parameters such as wettability, moisture content, morphological changes, microbial inactivation, and the presence of reactive species have been investigated. The results demonstrated an increase in seed wettability and moisture absorption, contributing to improved germination potential. Additionally, microbial inactivation has been significantly enhanced, suggesting that CAP treatment can help mitigate fungal contamination and improve seed health."

First, explicit sentiment features are extracted using a sentiment lexicon, while deep semantic features in the text are extracted using the XLM-RoBERTa pre-trained model; second, the explicit and deep semantic features extracted by the above methods are dynamically fused using an adaptive gate mechanism to accurately capture explicit and implicit sentiment expressions in social media texts; and then, the localized semantic meaning of the non-canonical short texts is enhanced by feature shift enhancement. local semantic sensitivity to non-canonical short texts, and the two synergistically enhance the accuracy and robustness of depression detection. Subsequently, the above feature extraction methods are utilized to extract the features of user tweets and depressive symptom description texts respectively, and the multivariate time series of user's depressive symptoms are obtained by calculating the similarity of these two, which are finally inputted into the time series classification model for depression detection. The experimental results show that compared with the existing feature extraction methods, our method has better detection performance, and its Accuracy and F1-Score both reach 0.9, which significantly improves the effect of depression detection."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are inherently prone to hallucination, as the accuracy of generated text cannot be guaranteed solely by their internal knowledge. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, its effectiveness highly depends on the relevance of the retrieved documents. The inclusion of irrelevant content often leads to performance degradation. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Reinforcement Learning-Retrieval Augmented Generation (DRL-RAG), a novel framework designed to improve the robustness of text generation. DRL-RAG utilizes relevance scores from a cross-encoder as a reward signal within a reinforcement learning (RL) mechanism to optimize the quality of retrieved documents. Recognizing that retrieval from static corpora frequently produces sub-optimal results, our framework dynamically extends retrieval to large-scale web search when necessary. Additionally, a confidence assessment mechanism selectively filters model-generated content based on reliability. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that DRL-RAG significantly outperforms existing RAG-based methods."

    "abstract": "REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) is a significant predictor of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s Disease, but its diagnosis currently requires resource-intensive polysomnography (PSG) studies, limiting widespread screening. This paper presents RBDGuard, a novel deep learning framework that enables RBD detection using only single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) data by leveraging both unlabeled and labeled datasets through unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning. This approach capitalizes on the increasing accessibility of ECG monitoring through wearable devices to offer an easy and inexpensive early diagnostic tool for sleep disorders. RBDGuard’s architecture employs bidirectional LSTM layers for unsupervised pre-training followed by dense layers with dropout for supervised classification. RBDGuard utilized 377,622 unlabeled 30-second ECG segments from 9,174 subjects and 39,316 labeled 30-second ECG segments from 37 subjects (22 RBD, 15 control) across three public databases. Compared to the exclusively supervised model, RBDGuard achieved significant improvements in accuracy (from $80 \\%$ to $97 \\%$) and reduction in misclassification (a $75 \\%$ decrease in false positives and 95% decrease in false negatives), reducing both missed diagnoses and unnecessary referrals. Extensive testing demonstrated that the model consistently maintained accuracies of $\\mathbf{9 7 \\% - 9 8 \\%}$ across different pre-training datasets, outperforming the supervised-only approach and indicating its adaptability to different clinical settings. These promising results establish RBDGuard as an accurate, efficient alternative to traditional PSG studies, paving the way for widespread early detection of RBD using unsupervised learning with ECGs. This advancement enables cost-effective, accessible early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, transforming medical care and improving millions of lives."

    "abstract": "Muscle fatigue remains a prevalent issue during hiking, particularly when carrying a loaded mountain backpack. Improper load distribution is a key contributing factor, especially affecting the lateral hamstrings (HA), which play a critical role in maintaining postural stability. This study investigates the impact of load placement on muscle fatigue, energy efficiency, and postural control using a quantitative experimental approach. Surface electromyography (sEMG) and blood lactate accumulation were employed as physiological indicators of fatigue. Muscle activity from the HA was recorded via sEMG, while blood lactate levels served as a complementary biomarker. sEMG signals were analyzed in both the time and frequency domains. Time-domain features, Mean Absolute Value (MAV), Root Mean Square (RMS), and Integrated EMG (iEMG), quantified muscle activation, while frequency-domain metrics, Median Frequency (MF), Mean Frequency (MnF), and Spectral Entropy (SEN), captured spectral changes associated with fatigue. ANOVA analysis in the frequency domain revealed p-values ranging from 0.06 to 0.12, with the most prominent trend observed for SEN (p = 0.0670). Although not statistically significant, post hoc analysis of both sEMG features and blood lactate data supported these trends, indicating potentially meaningful physiological responses to load placement. These preliminary results highlight the influence of backpack load configuration on muscle fatigue and underscore the need for further investigation with larger sample sizes to substantiate these findings and inform evidence-based hiking ergonomics."

This is a problem that makes access to information more complicated and reduces the user’s convenience. The proposed method focuses on the keyboard typing speed and enhances security without reducing convenience by detecting invalid users in the background. The authors compared user models learning with logistic regression, XGBoost, and CatBoost using keyboard typing data collected from 20 users.

    "abstract": "Dysarthric speech reconstruction (DSR) typically employs a cascaded system that combines automatic speech recognition (ASR) and sentence-level text-to-speech (TTS) to convert dysarthric speech into normally-prosodied speech. However, dysarthric individuals often speak more slowly, leading to excessively long response times in such systems, rendering them impractical in long-speech scenarios. Cascaded DSR systems based on streaming ASR and incremental TTS can help reduce latency. However, patients with differing dysarthria severity exhibit substantial pronunciation variability for the same text, resulting in poor robustness of ASR and limiting the intelligibility of reconstructed speech. In addition, incremental TTS suffers from poor prosodic feature prediction due to a limited receptive field. In this study, we propose an end-to-end simultaneous DSR system with two key innovations: 1) A frame-level adaptor module is introduced to bridge ASR and TTS. By employing explicitimplicit semantic information fusion and joint module training, it enhances the error tolerance of TTS to ASR outputs. 2) A multiple wait-k autoregressive TTS module is designed to mitigate prosodic degradation via multi-view knowledge distillation.

We propose a Visible Guided Pedestrian Detection (VGPD), in which the visible guided auxiliary head is only used during training, provides more supervision to reduce the ambiguity caused by occlusion, and helps eliminate false positives. The visible guided label assignment ensures accurate positive samples for heavily occluded pedestrians and improves classification. We utilize re-parameterization module that merges multiple computational layers into a single one at the inference stage, to enhance feature representation and reduce complexity. In addition, Adaptive Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF) and Path Aggregate Network (PAN) effectively fuse multiscale features. VGPD achieved state-of-the-art performance on CityPersons, reducing inference time by an average of 48%.

    "abstract": "This paper describes the first attempt at separation and tracking (3 D localization) of multiple moving sound sources using multiple microphone arrays fixed at known locations in an indoor environment. As for static sources, location-dependent priors have been incorporated on the time-invariant spatial covariance matrices (SCMs) of sources in the statistical framework of blind source separation based on multichannel nonnegative matrix factorization (MNMF), achieving the maximum likelihood estimation of source locations. One may thus make both the SCMs and their priors vary over time to deal with source movements. This naive extension, however, fails to localize sources when the sources are inactive, yielding non-smooth, non-continuous trajectory estimates. To solve this problem, we formulate a hierarchical probabilistic model for multichannel mixture signals that consists of inertial Markov models for source locations, location-aware moving-average models for source SCMs, and NMF-based lowrank models for the power spectral densities (PSDs) of sources. All the time-varying attributes of sources are jointly estimated under a maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) principle, and the source images are then estimated with a multichannel Wiener filter. The experiment using simulated data with two moving sources and four four-channel arrays showed that the proposed method achieved better separation and smoother localization."

Using only time-domain input–output data, we first establish a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure the data informativity for computing right-tangential moments. Once this condition is satisfied, the corresponding moments can be computed directly without requiring explicit identification of the full-order system. A reduced-order model (ROM) is then constructed by matching these moments along prescribed tangential directions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through its application to a high-dimensional wind farm system, showing significant model compression while preserving key dynamic characteristics."

    "abstract": "Source code review plays a critical role in ensuring software quality by identifying bugs early in the development process. Although recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for tasks such as vulnerability detection and automated code refinement, few studies have evaluated their performance against human reviewers during the review phase. In this study, we empirically evaluate the bug detection capabilities of several LLM-based AI chatbots using a benchmark C program containing 27 bugs, originally used in a prior human-based code review study. We tested AI chatbots including GPT-4o, Grok-3, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet, under varying conditions such as code granularity, specification document availability, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Our results show that while chatbots achieve bug detection performance comparable to that of human reviewers, they do not yet surpass them. We further analyze how code granularity, specification availability, and CoT reasoning affect the performance, and discuss the challenges that need to be addressed for effective LLM-assisted code review automation."

This model combines a highly efficient Triple Gate Vertical Power MOSFET made from SiGe materials with an 8-way balanced PA system. By using a wideband balanced PA setup with Lange couplers, the EDVEPT enhances signal stability, reduces insertion loss, and increases power output, particularly for FMCW radar in the W-band. It includes transformer-based push-pull PA stages, which improve output power and impedance matching. Simulation results show consistent performance, with insertion loss below 4 dB and output return loss above 8 dB under varying loads. It also features a probability-based error detection system and adaptive noise detection using infrared sensors.

    "abstract": "Food is the most important element of humanity and it attaches us to each other through diverse food experiences. As a result, the rise of recipe recommendation platforms has created the demand for more intelligent and context-aware systems that can offer personalized and precise results. In this paper we propose a new recipe recommending system which improves significant functionalities such as ingredient based search and recipe suggestions using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and handle real-time user feedback. Whether adding the intended twist to a dish by only searching for certain ingredients helps to bring different semantic organization into traditional keyword-based search is a question that can be answered only through experience. It incorporates BERT's bidirectional capabilities to very closely consider the query against not only which ingredients, but which cooking methods were used to create a recipe. Moreover, thanks to a dynamic adaptability feature, the AI continuously incorporates user feedback, tailoring its suggestions even further based on personal preferences and dietary restrictions. We further investigate the incorporation of up-to-the-minute user input, allowing the model to adjust its predictions based on the feedback provided to it by the user in the form of ratings and comments. Compared to traditional models, our approach demonstrates significantly improved recommendation accuracy, user engagement, and overall satisfaction, as evidenced by our results. As large datasets with complex ingredient combinations become more ubiquitous, the scalability of the model and its capacity to handle complex recipes will be one of the most important features of modern recipe recommendation systems. Personalized recipe platforms are an emerging area in the recipe domain, and this research adds to this new area by taking a more contextual and interactive approach to recipe search and discovery."

Although Graph Neural Networks have been widely used in emotion recognition to model contextual information, current research has not yet explored the full potential of heterogeneous multimodal data. Therefore, a heterogeneous graph is constructed based on speaker dependencies between utterances and connections between different modalities. This graph aims to capture the context of multimodal interactions. A dual attention mechanism is used to calculate the impact of various modalities on contextual information precisely. The features of the utterance are improved to distinguish confused emotions better. We evaluated the performance of our proposed model on two publicly available benchmark datasets (IEMOCAP and MELD). Extensive experiments have shown that our model outperforms the baseline models."

    "abstract": "In large-scale distributed systems, log data grows rapidly and poses significant challenges to storage and transmission. Traditional general-purpose compression methods often fail to exploit the structural characteristics of logs, leading to suboptimal compression performance. Existing log parsingbased compression methods exhibit unstable performance in parameter mapping dictionaries and fail to account for nonnumerical data compression. To address the two problems, we proposes LogTRV, a log compression framework that integrates log parsing with multi-level encoding strategies. The framework first utilizes the TCMS parser to separate log templates and parameters. It then applies a series of data processing models, including timestamp delta encoding, token run-length encoding, and numeric variable-length encoding, to reduce redundancy. Finally, the processed data is compressed using a general-purpose algorithm (e.g., bzip2). Experiments on large-scale real-world log datasets demonstrate that LogTRV achieves significantly higher compression ratios than baseline methods such as gzip, bzip2, and Logzip, while maintaining competitive compression efficiency. The results also highlight the effectiveness of different parsing and encoding modules within LogTRV."

To resolve these challenges, we propose RoutingGuard, which aims to identify the minimal set of backup paths for protecting optimal routes. We further design a novel dual-stack data structure that significantly enhances execution efficiency and ensures computational accuracy through controlled path access sequencing. Experimental results demonstrate that RoutingGuard achieves the highest protection rate compared to existing approaches while maintaining top-tier convergence speed."

    "abstract": "As the foundation of modern software ecosystems, a distribution of Operating System (OS) is usually composed of a certain number of software packages among which exist complex dependency relationships. The refactoring of package dependency structures is an important form of evolution between different distributions that has been key factor affecting the compatibility of OS. Existing studies primarily focus on static dependencies or specific software subsets, lacking systemlevel modeling and structural analysis of cross-version evolution of the OS. To address this gap, we propose a unified framework for system-level modeling and analysis based on graph embedding techniques, designed to characterize structural changes in OS package dependencies over time. Our method constructs a homogeneous dependency graph spanning multiple OS versions and applies the HOPE embedding algorithm to extract evolution features and detect changes in dependency structure. Using this framework, we identify a novel evolution pattern -intermediate-layer phenomena - where functional roles remain stable despite significant structural refactoring. We further classify these phenomena into two types: refactored intermediate layers, which optimize architecture by reorganizing dependency topologies, and transition intermediate layers, which preserve interface compatibility through proxy packages. We validate our approach on six Ubuntu LTS versions (14.04-24.04), achieving 85.5% accuracy in detecting refactored intermediate layers and successfully uncovering unmarked transition proxy packages. This work offers a new perspective and technical means for analyzing OS structural evolution and assessing compatibility risks."

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate multimodal foundation models (MFMs) for EmoFake detection (EFD) and hypothesize that they will outperform audio foundation models (AFMs). MFMs due to their cross-modal pre-training, learns emotional patterns from multiple modalities, while AFMs rely only on audio. As such, MFMs can better recognize unnatural emotional shifts and inconsistencies in manipulated audio, making them more effective at distinguishing real from fake emotional expressions. To validate our hypothesis, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of state-of-the-art (SOTA) MFMs (e.g. LanguageBind) alongside AFMs (e.g. WavLM). Our experiments confirm that MFMs surpass AFMs for EFD. Beyond individual foundation models (FMs) performance, we explore FMs fusion, motivated by findings in related research areas such synthetic speech detection and speech emotion recognition. To this end, we propose SCAR, a novel framework for effective fusion. SCAR introduces a nested cross-attention mechanism, where representations from FMs interact at two stages sequentially to refine information exchange. Additionally, a self-attention refinement module further enhances feature representations by reinforcing important cross-FM cues while suppressing noise. Through SCAR with synergistic fusion of MFMs, we achieve SOTA performance, surpassing both standalone FMs and conventional fusion approaches and previous works on EFD."

We propose Patrol, a max-min passive-active hybrid INT method designed for efficient global network telemetry in Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Patrol designs a maximal-coverage passive INT strategy and a minimal-cost active INT strategy. Using these strategies, Patrol achieves full telemetry coverage and lowbandwidth network telemetry.

    "abstract": "Dilated convolution and transposed convolution are widely used in the inference or backpropagation of generative adaptive networks (GANs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). They introduce non-contributing zeros in structured sparsity patterns (called regular sparsity in this work) into the kernels or into the feature maps as an inherent pre-processing stage before executing standard convolution operations. Existing accelerator designs typically pre-populate tensors with explicit zero values and then perform sparse computing on the zeropopulated tensors, which incurs high control complexity and hardware overhead. To address this, we propose CRSPU, a systolic array-based accelerator exploiting regular sparsity without modifying its original data flow. We redesign the traditional im2col algorithm with two address-level optimizations—Public Dimension Compression (PDC) and Similar Sparsity Merging (SSM)—to eliminate unnecessary computations induced by non-contributing zeros.

However, in urban environments, it is difficult to evaluate the cumulative interference from a large number of terrestrial wireless terminals to conventional satellite ground stations in real time, due to the massive number and mobility of terminals. This paper proposes an approach to reduce the computational cost of interference estimation by clustering terrestrial terminals. This enables significant reduction in the complexity of interference calculations. Furthermore, we propose a new clustering method based on the similarity of radio propagation characteristics. The method uses standardized RSSI values and terminal positions as features, and applies recursive clustering with dynamic deviation control to minimize propagation variation within clusters. Simulation using real-world terminal distribution data in an urban area demonstrates that the proposed method improves propagation similarity within clusters while maintaining coarser cluster partitioning compared to conventional methods. Validation of interference estimation accuracy using the proposed clustering method will be addressed in future work."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a speech synthesis system for the Indonesian language using the Tacotron 2 architecture and HiFi-GAN vocoder. While Tacotron 2 has demonstrated strong performance in high-resource languages, adapting it for Indonesian remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a hybrid attention mechanism that combines location-sensitive and content-based attention to improve alignment accuracy and convergence during training. The system is trained on a custom Indonesian audiobook dataset prepared in LJSpeech format. We compare several model variants, including versions with and without phoneme conversion, and evaluate them using both subjective and objective metrics. Speech quality is assessed through Mean Opinion Score (MOS) ratings, while model performance is evaluated via attention weight visualization. Results show that the proposed hybrid attention mechanism accelerates alignment learning and produces speech with improved naturalness and intelligibility, confirming its effectiveness for low-resource TTS in Indonesian."

    "abstract": "In the construction of university libraries, digital libraries integrate online electronic resources and offline book resources to provide users with recommended book information services. However, with the increasing number of literature resources in the library system, effectively helping readers efficiently and accurately discover the required book information in the context of big data becomes difficult. Personalized recommendation systems for digital books face two challenges in big data environments: data sparsity and the difficulty of dynamically generating accurate recommendations for incremental users. To address these issues, we developed a personalized recommendation system based on column-row singular value decomposition (CUR-SVD) incremental matrix factorization. The method involves selecting a subset of columns from the original user-item interaction matrix to form a matrix C and a subset of rows to form a matrix R. SVD is then applied to construct the linking matrix U. In this system, C and R serve as feature matrices for users and books, respectively. Because C and R are derived directly from real data, the CUR-SVD incremental matrix factorization technique enables the transformation of high-dimensional matrices into lower-dimensional representations while preserving the sparsity inherent in the original dataset. This property is particularly advantageous for generating personalized recommendations for newly added users or items. Validation results using the Amazon book dataset demonstrated that the CUR-SVD method showed a recommendation accuracy exceeding 93%, outperforming traditional matrix decomposition techniques such as singular value decomposition and principal component analysis. These results indicate that the CUR-SVD system maintains high predictive performance and effectively retains the sparsity structure of the original data, making it well-suited for scalable and interpretable recommendation systems in digital library environments."

    "abstract": "During etching on a thick substrate oxide layer with the application of conventional photoresist (PR), fence formation and by-product deposition were observed on the diffraction grating surface, prompting the use of UV resin. However, UV resin is susceptible to mechanical or chemical alterations in its surface due to the type and mixture ratio of etching gases, leading to the occurrence of a wiggling phenomenon. The wiggling effect can be attributed to factors such as non-uniform flux of etching gases, excessive plasma energy, prolonged etching times, and chemical reactions with the etching gases. Since samples exhibiting wiggling behavior display altered ashing characteristics, which can influence the overall process, identifying the precise causes of wiggling is critical for optimizing etching conditions."

    "abstract": "Currently, most studies on voltage recovery after spark breakdown utilize the double-pulse method or focus on breakdowns at relatively low repetition frequencies (<10 kHz). However, investigating breakdown voltage at high repetition frequencies is of great significance for applications such as the repetitive operation of spark switches. In this study, the breakdown voltage of two electrodes in atmospheric air under repetitive nanosecond pulses was measured. Schlieren imaging was employed to observe the breakdown channels and airflow disturbance. Experimental results show that at low repetition frequencies (10 kHz), the breakdown voltage remains relatively stable. In contrast, at high repetition frequencies (20 kHz-100 kHz), the breakdown voltage increases after a few milliseconds and exhibits significant fluctuation. At 100 kHz, periodic fluctuation in the breakdown voltage was also observed. This behavior can be explained as follows: at low repetition frequencies, airflow disturbance is minimal and nearly axisymmetric, and breakdown channels consistently follow the axis between the two electrodes. In contrast, at high repetition frequencies, the higher the breakdown voltage, the longer the breakdown channels. Airflow disturbance becomes stronger and asymmetric, and breakdown no longer occurs along the axis but instead forms irregular, curved channels that tend to appear in regions with greater disturbance. These findings suggest that the fluctuation of breakdown voltage under repetitive pulses is caused by changes of breakdown channels resulting from airflow disturbance, rather than stochasticity."

In the case of cost-constrained CubeSat satellites, the available commercial EPS options are relatively expensive and limited in their capabilities. This article describes a feature-rich and fault-tolerant EPS for CubeSats that is being distributed under the open-source model, which is well-suited for supporting the modest budgets and diverse mission objectives of both academic as well as industrial satellite designers. Adoption of the open source model promotes further development of the initial design. The proposed EPS provides capabilities that match or surpass the features and fault-tolerance of the commercial EPS alternatives. It provides four independent channels that provide optimized power extraction from the solar panels using maximum power point tracking. The fault-tolerance capabilities of the EPS include the use of a dual-processor microcontroller with ECC memory and 18 power channels (plus 2 internal) with over-current sensing and automatic channel shut-down, with the ability to automatically adjust the current threshold over time to account for radiation-induced aging effects. The article details the capabilities and fault-tolerance features of the EPS, and then presents the results of detailed testing and characterization experiments on a completed implementation."

Deep Q-Network (DQN), leveraging their inherent dynamic adaptability, have been extensively adopted for training DSA strategies in dynamic spectrum management systems. In order to enhance the shared user experience in DSA-enabled systems, this work improves the DQN with high flexibility and scalability to enable the learning of more efficient DSA policies, thereby elevating spectrum utilization efficiency. By integrating skip connections and locality analysis, we introduce a Multiple Time-Scale fusion Deep Echo State Network (MT-DESN) designed to strengthen multi-temporal feature extraction capabilities in time-series data. The MT-DESN is embedded within the DQN framework to holistically extract and fuse multi-scale temporal features, facilitating the training of high-performance DSA strategies. MT-DESN employs three independent reservoirs with tailored recurrent connections to model dependencies across diverse temporal scales in time-series data. Then, it aggregates multi-scale echo states, and generates optimized spectrum access decisions. Experimental validation demonstrates that the MT-DESN-based DSA approach achieves superior spectrum access success rates and reduces collision probabilities compared to conventional deep echo state network and classical DSA methodologies."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a multi-satellite cooperative covert satellite communication (SatCom) scheme, where a positive covert rate is achieved in ultra-dense low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations by exploiting both interference and directional uncertainty. Specifically, interference arises from aggregate sidelobe leakage from other satellite transmissions, while directional uncertainty stems from the random selection of the transmitting satellite among multiple accessible ones. To this end, we first propose a LEO satellite network model and formulate the corresponding hypothesis testing problem for the cooperative covert SatCom scheme. The power distribution of the aggregate interference is quantified and approximated using stochastic geometry. Next, by analyzing the detection error probability and outage probability under the impact of aggregate interference, we derive an approximate covert capacity expression for the case of a single accessible satellite, which maintains a positive covert rate even as the slot length approaches infinity. Furthermore, by leveraging directional uncertainty through hiding the signal’s angle of arrival, we analyze the multi-satellite cooperative covert SatCom scheme, leading to a concise approximate expression that reveals significant covert capacity improvement. Numerical simulations are performed to verify the superiority of the proposed scheme, suggesting that a positive covert capacity can be achieved with interference uncertainty and significantly enhanced by directional uncertainty as the number of satellites increases."

Second, we introduce an <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">OTK-based non-orthogonal artificial noise</i> mechanism that synthesizes artificial noise from the negotiated OTK and optimizes its power allocation to jam eavesdroppers while remaining transparent to legitimate receivers. Security and cost analyses highlight the robustness and efficiency of channel-assisted hyperelliptic curve cryptography; an NS-3 implementation confirms practicality. Simulations show that OTK-based non-orthogonal artificial noise increases secrecy capacity by 61.11% and 167.74% relative to traditional artificial noise and OTK-based non-orthogonal artificial noise, respectively. We integrate channel-assisted hyperelliptic curve cryptography with OTK-based non-orthogonal artificial noise. Together, they provide end-to-end protection for industrial internet of things authentication and communication."

    "abstract": "In this work, we present a novel precoder design for multiuser massive multiple input multiple output (MU-mMIMO) systems impaired by nonlinear effects at the transmitter. By exploiting the rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) technique for user messages, we develop an analytical precoding framework based on the multilinear generalized singular value (ML-GSVD) decompositions for two or more matrices. This framework provides a robust statistical characterization of transmitted signals and enables accurate performance evaluation of precoding techniques in the presence of nonlinearities. Moreover, we introduce an iterative GSVD distortion cancellation (GSVD-DC) receiver for scenarios with strong nonlinear effects. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves substantial improvements in bit error rate (BER) compared to conventional precoders, for both linear and nonlinear cases, with moderate complexity increase, and without relying on successive interference cancellation (SIC). This makes the GSVD-DC receiver a promising solution for efficient and robust communications in nonlinear environments."

This study investigates how different scanning trajectories affect the quality of MPI-reconstructed images, with an emphasis on scanning parameters, particularly scanning duration, which includes both scanning repeat and scanning time. The impacts of sampling frequency, scanning repeat, and scanning time on the quality of MPI-reconstructed images were examined across a wide range of scanning trajectories and pattern densities. Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE), and Normalized Sum of Squared Errors (NSSE) were the four metrics used to assess the quality of MPI-reconstructed images. The optimal sampling frequency is 6×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">6</sup> Hz or higher, as evidenced by the convergence of all four measures to the same values. At low scanning density (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N<sub>p</sub></i> < 80), increasing scanning repeats or times does not improve image quality.

This study illustrates the peculiar effect of different scanning trajectories on the quality of MPI-reconstructed images at low and high scanning densities. Our simulations reveal how trajectory density and scan time impact image quality and reconstruction accuracy, providing a foundation for how long to scan or how many repetitions to rescan the sample to improve image quality."

A modulation method based on Compton scattering to increase the utilization ratio of the radiation field is presented in this paper. Escaped photons are scattered into the detection region partially to increase the utilization ratio of radiation field by a Compton scattering layer with specific materials and structures. In addition, the average energy of the photon is reduced. The progress of Compton scattering of photons in materials at different energy and incident angles is studied. The effects of the materials and structures of Compton scattering layer on the radiation intensity and photon energy of X-ray are simulated. A Compton scattering layer is designed for the hard X-ray source, the array of cylindrical virtual cathode reflex triode, and an experimental study has been carried out. The experimental results show that the utilization ratio of the radial field is increased by 12 % by the Compton scattering, and the result has a good agreement with the simulation result of 13.5 %, which is an effective method to enhance the intensity of the radiation field."

In this work, we present a real-time motion synthesis method that generates the detailed fretting hand motion for playing guitar. Our approach first involves capturing and post-processing hand motion data from guitar performances to create a data set for training. The post-processing ensures that the fingertip positions are placed as accurately as possible regarding distance from the fretboard and location between the frets. We then train a neural network that learns to predict hand and finger poses based on guitar tabs and previous poses. We found that our method produces reasonably stable motion and evaluate our results using accuracy measures and visual evaluation."

However, challenges such as substrate damage caused by high ion energies, particle contamination, and non-uniform thin film deposition hinder the reliability and quality of this process. To address these issues, this study analyzes the dual role of microwave sources in heating and plasma generation. Depending on the presence of discharge gases and pressure conditions, microwave sources can function as wafer heating or plasma discharge systems. Microwave heating enables volumetric heating by selectively interacting with materials that possess appropriate dielectric properties. Additionally, it can be utilized as a low-ion-energy microwave plasma source to minimize substrate damage, while providing a high-density and uniform plasma environment based on the modes formed through the antenna. A 2.45 GHz microwave was propagated in the TE10 mode within a waveguide and radiated into the chamber through a slot in a toroidal antenna. Comprehensive simulations and experimental evaluations were conducted to analyze the effects of key parameters, such as cavity geometry, pressure, and power input, on plasma properties and heating profiles."

    "abstract": "Ozone is characterized by its strong oxidizing power and no toxic residue. It can be applied to a wide range of fields, including semiconductor cleaning, sterilization, bleaching, decolorization, and deodorization, and is attracting attention as a next-generation oxidant. There are various methods of generating ozone, of which the discharge method is the mainstream in the industrial field. The discharge method using a nanosecond pulse power reported by Namihira et al is one of the promising way to realize ideal ozonizer. Nanosecond pulsed discharge mainly consists of primary streamers and it leads to higher energy efficiency of ozone generation than barrier discharge. However, the ozone concentration produced by nanosecond pulsed power become saturated around <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$40 \\text{gm}-3$</tex>, which is not enough to the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$100 \\text{gm}-3$</tex> required for industrial applications. It is considered that the saturation of ozone concentration was caused by higher frequency electrical ringing following nanosecond pulse voltage. In this paper, the time reduction of the ringing was done by connecting a resistor between the nanosecond pulse power supply and the discharge reactor. The ringing time was determined by voltage and current waveforms and also discharge observation. As the results, the resister between the generator and reactor suppressed the ringing time and the characteristics of ozone generation was improved."

    "abstract": "A CO2 Laser, excited by a bipolar pulsed power source, is utilized for fine processing of printed circuit boards (PCBs). Recently, due to the increasing demand for PCBs, faster processing speeds have been required. Consequently, the repetition rate of a bipolar Marx generator needs to be increased while maintaining the shape of the pulses. However, the resistors or inductors needed to isolate each stages of a Marx circuit impede charge current, resulting in increased charge time and a decreased repetition rate. To address this issue, we adopted a magnetic coupling inductor as an isolator in a full bridge type bipolar Marx circuit. This approach results in the inductance decrease of the magnetic coupling inductor during the charge mode because the magnetic flux is offset. On the other hand, the inductance during the discharge mode increases as the magnetic flux is mutually intensified. Thus, it is expected that fast capacitor charge is possible while maintaining the function of the isolator during the Marx output. To confirm that, an 8 stages full bridge bipolar Marx generator connecting the coupling inductors to each stage was tested. As the result, the charge speed was improved, and the maximum repetition rate with stable pulse output was 150 Hz. However, stray resistor such as the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the capacitor still restricted the charge speed, and the magnetic coupling inductor we made ourselves is not optimal. Thus, we will continue to improve the charging speed with further investigation."

Additionally, interest has grown significantly in the development of novel electric propulsion systems that can use conventional chemical propellants as fuel. A liquid-fed pulsed magnetoplasmadynamic (pulsed- MPD) thruster shows substantial promise as a low power, high efficiency propulsion system with compatibility for dual-mode operation, combining chemical and electric propulsion modes. A novel “green” monopropellant ASCENT (Advanced Spacecraft Energetic Non-Toxic), developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory, has been demonstrated in this system with a novel low energy ignitor and propellant feeding mechanism. In this work, measurements of total ion current in the exhaust plume, electron number density, electron temperature, ion exhaust velocity, cathode erosion, and mass bit were conducted in a long-duration testing of 100,000 discharge pulses characterized by typical discharge voltages and currents in the range 50–150 V and 5–10 kA, respectively. These measurements were used to produce estimates of thruster performance parameters including impulse bit, specific impulse, projected total impulse, mass utilization fraction, and total system efficiency. Additionally, an orbital mission to demonstrate the use of the ASCENT-propelled pulsed-MPD thruster on a CubeSat via an orbit-raising maneuver was developed. The mission was selected to be directly relevant for future customer use cases of dualmode systems. The development included the design, fabrication, and testing of CubeSat subsystems including Pulsed-MPD Propulsion Subsystem, Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem, Radio Communication, Electrical Power Subsystem, Command and Control Subsystem, and Satellite Software."

Such a beam driven plasma system supports high frequency electrostatic plasma modes the breaking phenomena of which are investigated elaborately. The set of nonlinear relativistic fluid equations are solved using Sagdeev Pseudo Potential technique which enable us to determine the maximum allowed value of the electric field amplitude of the high frequency plasma wave. This limiting value is the so called wave breaking amplitude of the relativistic plasma wave. The breaking amplitude is found to be a function of the beam density, relativistic Lorentz factor associated with phase velocity of the plasma wave as well as on the proton beam speed. Dermination of the breaking amplitude has its relevance in the field of plasma wake field accelerators in which beam plasma interactions are considered. The maximum energy that can be achieved in such accelerator is determined by this limiting amplitude.

Its measured amplitude of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{S}_{21}$</tex> is better than −3.5 dB, and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{S}_{11}$</tex> is less than −18.1 dB from 0.21 to 0.23 THz, with an attenuation constant below 0.78 dB/cm. CST simulations predict a saturated output power of 120 W at 0.22 THz, with a 3-dB bandwidth exceeding 50 GHz. The MSWS exhibits high interaction impedance due to the enhancement of local electric fields caused by metamaterial. The simulated average interaction impedance is over 5Ω within 0.210-0.226 THz. The maximum output power is predicted by CST PIC to be 400 W with a 3-dB bandwidth of 5.4 GHz. In addition, a large current density sheet beam electron gun employing scandate cathode is experimentally studied. Its measured beam current is 170 mA and beam current density is 425 A/cm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> at the beam waist position of z=9.3 mm (the cathode emission surface is located at <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$z=0$</tex> mm).

Based on the sheet beam EOS, a sheet beam TWT employing SDVSWS has been assembled. Its output power experiment is underway. These research efforts have potential applications to deep space exploration, radar detection, imaging, and high-speed data communication."

    "abstract": "Capacitor banks form the backbone of various pulsed power systems across various applications. The capacitors must be rapidly charged and discharged for repetitive pulsed power applications. Therefore, a capacitor-charging high-voltage power supply (CCPS) is inevitable to efficiently charge capacitors to high voltages for applications like plasma material processing, electromagnetic forming, particle accelerators, etc. The authors have developed a compact resonant converter topology that efficiently utilizes the parasitics of the high-voltage transformer and the secondary end rectifier. Initially, the authors analyzed various resonant converter topologies and compared their feasibility for pulsed power applications. The developed converter is based on an LCLC-resonant tank operating at 150 kHz using SiC devices. The high-frequency operation compacts the converter by significantly reducing the size of magnetic components. In addition, the primary switches operate under ZVS (zero-voltage switching) during the entire charging cycle. The resonant tank is designed to use the voltage-balancing network parameters in the secondary high-voltage rectifier, which reduces the final component count. The developed converter has inherent short-circuit and open-circuit protection for pulsed power applications. The converter can operate on a full ripple DC voltage, eliminating the need for a front-end bulky filter electrolytic capacitor in the AC rectifier. Finally, a controller based on Constant Current and Constant Power (CC-CP) mode, employing a variable frequency control technique, has been designed to control the charging rate of the capacitor banks. The designed converter also exhibits modularity to increase the voltage and current rating of the final applications. The developed system is capable of both single-shot and burst-mode operations. The authors have simulated the result in PLECS and have developed a 1 kW prototype. The results are experimentally verified and compared against the simulated results."

    "abstract": "Infrared imaging is widely used in remote sensing and military target recognition due to its strong resistance to interference in complex environments. However, imaging mechanisms and hardware limitations cause infrared images to have low-resolution, sparse textures, and significant background noise, which severely restrict the detection of small targets such as low-altitude drones and weak thermal emitters. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight Local–Global Dual-Path Feature Fusion Network (LDFF-Net) that enhances the resolution and quality of infrared images, providing high-quality inputs for subsequent detection tasks. The network includes a Small Target Feature Recognition Module (STFRM) composed of three key components. The Enhanced High Frequency Perception Module (EHFPM) strengthens high-frequency details of small targets while suppressing noise, enabling robust local feature extraction. The State-Space Model (SSM) captures long-range dependencies with linear complexity and models semantic relationships between targets and background to compensate for the limited receptive field of local features. The Adaptive Feature Fusion Unit (AFFU) combines local and global features adaptively to improve the saliency of small targets. During training, we introduce a realistic degradation process based on visible-light images to generate training samples that include complex degradation patterns and noise, which enhances the model’s robustness and generalization. Evaluation on the ARCHIVE and SIRST datasets demonstrates that LDFF-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across eight widely used full-reference and no-reference metrics, including PSNR, LPIPS, FID, and NIQE. This result confirms the model’s effectiveness in enhancing both the super-resolution and detection performance of infrared small target images. The code and pretrained model weights are publicly available at https://github.com/98Hao/LDFF-Net."

    "abstract": "Tidal flats, situated at the intersection of land and sea, are ecologically sensitive zones whose dynamic changes are critical for environmental conservation and disaster forecasting. The fusion of infrared and visible imagery enables the acquisition of multidimensional information, providing comprehensive observational support for tasks such as tidal geomorphological evolution and habitat identification. However, existing research predominantly focuses on urban and natural landscapes, and the lack of infrared-visible datasets tailored for tidal flat monitoring hampers the performance of fusion models in real world scenarios. To address this challenge, we construct the first geostationary satellite-based multimodal tidal flat image dataset, MTFRS, comprising 2,365 pairs of infrared and visible images from the Yellow River estuary. The dataset spans multiple seasons and tidal conditions, offering high geometric consistency and diverse scene annotations. In addition, we propose a novel fusion method, RSTFuse, which integrates CNN and ViT architectures to enhance inter-modal correlation and detail extraction, thereby improving fusion performance. Through evaluation of semantic segmentation algorithms on MTFRS, we established a benchmark. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our RSTFuse method significantly enhances cross-modal feature complementarity in tidal flat scenarios during image fusion tasks, exhibits stronger robustness to seasonal variations, and outperforms mainstream methods in both visual performance and quantitative metrics."

Experimental results demonstrate robust mitigation of both in-band and out-of-band interference, achieving over 20 dB suppression across diverse scenarios. Our technique effectively restores degraded constellations and maintains stable cancellation up to 42 dB rejection even as interference power increases progressively.

Does the distribution system operator (DSO) have to know load demands at each bus of the feeder to solve an optimal power flow (OPF)? This work exploits redundancies in OPF's structure and data to minimize the communication of such a data deluge, and explores the trade-off between data compression and the grid's performance. We propose an OPF data distillation framework involving two steps: The DSO first collects OPF data in near-real-time from only a subset of nodes. It subsequently reconstructs the complete OPF data from the partial ones, and feeds them into the OPF solver. Selecting and reconstructing OPF data may be performed to maximize the fidelity of the reconstructed data or the associated OPF solutions. Under the first objective, OPF data distillation is posed as a sparsity-regularized convex problem. Under the second objective, it is posed as a sparsity-regularized bilevel program. Both problems are solved using proximal gradient algorithms. The second objective is superior in approximating OPF solutions at the expense of increased complexity. Numerical tests show that it enhances the fidelity and feasibility of the reconstructed OPF solutions, which can be approximated reasonably well even from partial data."

    "abstract": "Simultaneous wireless power and data transfer (SWPDT) is a promising technology to enhance the operational intelligence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Conventional shared-channel SWPDT systems, which use the same channel for both forward and backward data transmission, often require complex filtering circuits to reduce crosstalk during bidirectional communication. To overcome this limitation, this article introduces a novel magnetic coupler with two independent data transmission channels tailored for UAV SWPDT applications. The proposed architecture employs separate channels for forward and backward data, inherently minimizing crosstalk during bidirectional communication. Power and data transmission still share the coupling channel through frequency division multiplexing (FDM), eliminating the need for additional communication coils. The magnetic coupler comprises two DD coils and two solenoid coils, offering a compact, conformal, and lightweight structure with low leakage magnetic interference. On the power side, a dual-transmitter–dual-receiver topology is implemented using bilateral <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">LCC</i> compensation networks.

Analytical models relating signal amplitude to circuit parameters are established, along with a systematic design method. An experimental prototype achieves an output power of 174 W with a DC-to-DC efficiency of 87.2%. The system demonstrates a data rate of 500 kb/s in both forward and backward directions, yielding a total bidirectional data rate of 1 Mb/s.

    "abstract": "The Large Baseline Imaging Radar Altimeter (LB-IRA) effectively compensates for severe baseline decorrelation effects caused by kilometer-scale interferometric baselines through the introduction of carrier frequency shifts, thereby improving altimetric accuracy to the sub-centimeter level. However, this frequency-shift-based compensation strategy imposes stringent constraints on the system bandwidth (typically limited to ≤66.90 MHz), which restricts range resolution and multi-look capability, ultimately degrading overall altimetric performance. Based on the dual-transmit dual-receive, time-division interferometric architecture of LB-IRA, this paper proposes, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the implementation of a Spatio-Temporal Beam Separation (STBS) observation scheme within a dual-satellite LB-IRA system, incorporating polarization diversity to achieve simultaneous spatial and temporal separation of transmitted signals. By fully exploiting the spatial separation of dual radar main lobes and the temporal alternation provided by the satellite formation, the proposed STBS scheme effectively removes the bandwidth limitation induced by carrier frequency shifts and enables flexible wide-band system design with a bandwidth expansion from ≤66.90 MHz to 300 MHz. Quantitative simulation results demonstrate that, owing to higher parameter design freedom and improved multi-look efficiency, the proposed scheme enhances the effective number of looks by approximately 436.2% and reduces the phase-induced altimetric error to 0.365 cm at a spatial resolution of 1 km, corresponding to an accuracy improvement of about 59% compared with the conventional observation mode. This study provides a theoretical foundation for the design of next-generation bistatic interferometric imaging radar altimeter systems and offers key technical support for high-resolution ocean dynamic environment retrieval tasks."

Accelerated electrons collide with a high Z converter target producing X-rays through the bremsstrahlung process. The X-rays are used to image hydrodynamic experiments. The second accelerator (Axis-II) produces multiple pulses each 10s to 100s of nanoseconds long over a 1.6 microsecond period. Over this time the converter target heats and rapidly expands changing the X-ray production region. This beam-target interaction has rich multiscale physics including hydrodynamic expansion, beam-plasma instabilities and charged particle transport. However, diagnostic access to the region is limited due to radiation shielding. To facilitate beam-target physics studies, a 90-degree bending achromat has been designed to transport the Axis-II beam to a separate target area which is amenable to fielding diagnostics."

The objective is to jointly optimize beam hopping and power allocation strategy for maximizing the long-term sum rate while simultaneously satisfying delay fairness demand. However, the interference caused by full frequency reuse among beams limits the efficacy of RSMA, and the frequent beam patterns changes make instantaneous channel state information (CSI) detection a challenge. To address these challenges, this paper designs a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based resource allocation framework for discrete-continuous action spaces. To alleviate explosion of action space, each beam is treated as a DRL agent, and a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning method is proposed to learn the beam scheduling policy. In addition, an action mapping mechanism is employed to further manage the DRL power allocation for satisfying the power input constraint arising from limited satellite power budget. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve the highest sum rate of the system while ensuring fairness among non-uniform traffic load cells compared with several baseline methods."

However, in realistic irregular terrain environments, conventional DOA estimation algorithms suffer from a substantial loss of accuracy due to severe multipath effects and the difficulty of accurately modeling such propagation phenomena. To address these challenges, a hierarchical optimization-based DOA estimation method is proposed for low-elevation targets. First, a multipath signal model adapted to irregular terrain is developed, where non-ideal path reflections induced by terrain variation are modeled as stochastic perturbations. Then, high-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) is applied to extract the tensor signal subspace from the element space, which is subsequently projected onto a lower-dimensional beamspace for efficient processing. On this basis, a two-level hierarchical optimization framework is proposed. In the first stage, a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm in the beamspace provides coarse estimates of the target elevation angle and multipath angle of arrival. These estimates are subsequently refined in the second stage through a joint optimization procedure that combines alternating iteration with the quasi-Newton Broyden– Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) method. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits excellent estimation accuracy and robustness under irregular terrain conditions, while maintaining relatively low computational complexity."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an adaptive architecture for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted wireless communication, enhancing system performance by dynamically switching between polarization diversity and directivity modes. The RIS is divided into spatially contiguous subnets, referred to as groups, each comprising two identical tiles that serve a user or group of users within a specific zone. Each tile within a group is independently configurable to reflect waves with right-hand circular polarization (RHCP) or left-hand circular polarization (LHCP), alongside independent phase control for fine-grained beamforming. A novel, intelligent mode selection algorithm first performs a Dynamic Strategy Preview to assess the overall interference environment, then uses a local correlation metric–termed Circular Basis Correlation (CBC)–for fine-grained, per-group decisions. The CBC is estimated from uplink pilot signals within a time division duplex (TDD) framework, enabling low-complexity mode selection. The architecture supports dynamic group reconfiguration based on channel conditions, improving signal robustness and energy capture for linearly polarized receivers. Simulations under two distinct Rician fading scenarios reveal a nuanced trade-off between signal power maximization and interference management. The proposed adaptive scheme intelligently navigates this trade-off, outperforming fixed configurations across different channel conditions and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes."

This study introduces battery reconfiguration as an innovative system-level maintenance strategy within a benefit-oriented predictive maintenance (PdM) framework, aiming to improve both operational reliability and energy efficiency. A binary-state characterization model is proposed, where safety is inferred from internal resistance using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and performance is determined by capacity—together constraining the system’s energy output. To evaluate economic value, a comprehensive generation-side benefit model is developed, incorporating both peak shaving services and electricity market participation. The reconfiguration task is formulated as a large-scale combinatorial optimization problem (COP) and is efficiently solved using a tailored degradation-aware improved genetic algorithm (DA-IGA). Numerical experiments on a 10×20 BESS system demonstrate that the proposed strategy achieves a 14.73% increase in energy output, a 22.47% improvement in net benefit, and an 84.58% reduction in renewable energy curtailment compared to a non-reconfigured baseline."

To address these limitations, we propose a novel 2.5D-assisted future urban remote sensing image synthesis method, aimed at generating future urban layouts based on existing urban structures and 2.5D planning maps. Specifically, the 2.5D map is divided into construction and demolition components, which are then integrated with the existing layout images and the embedding of the corresponding text as conditions for our generative model. We further design two trainable cascaded gated attention layers that process these two conditions separately and embed them into the latent diffusion model (LDM). This approach allows our model to dynamically comprehend the planning design requirements for key areas, making adjustments to accommodate diverse demands. Compared to existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods, our approach effectively targets design requirements, enabling flexible modifications that involve new constructions and demolitions in relevant urban areas. Experimental results on the 3DCD dataset demonstrate that the images generated by our method retain high fidelity and exhibit strong consistency with the 2.5D planning map."

    "abstract": "Low-resolution visible-infrared image fusion and super-resolution (LRVIF) are critical for enhancing image quality in low-resolution scenarios, yet limited information in the input images often constrains performance. To address these challenges, we propose SaDiff, a spatially-aware adaptive diffusion model that introduces diffusion processes into LRVIF for the first time, representing a major breakthrough in the field. Leveraging the generative capabilities of diffusion models, our approach unifies and enhances image fusion and super-resolution within a cohesive framework. A key component of SaDiff is the Spatial Residual Adaptation Block, which extends the diffusion process by dynamically adapting feature representations to spatial variations in the local regions of the input images. This module maximally preserves crucial information from the input images, such as texture details and contrast, while effectively suppressing noise, ensuring robust and context-aware feature refinement. Then we further propose Direct Diffusion Synthesis, a novel mechanism that utilizes noise predictions during diffusion to generate fused images, enabling joint training of the fusion and super-resolution networks. Additionally, a Cross-Feature Fusion Module integrates texture and contrast details, producing super-resolution fused images with improved clarity and structural integrity. Extensive experiments show that SaDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a robust and unified solution to infrared-visible image fusion and super-resolution. The code for the proposed method will be made available at https://github.com/guobaoxiao/SaDiff."

    "abstract": "This article deals with alternative scalar potential formulations where no side effect associated to gauging exists whose purpose is to enhance the variety of accessible methods for efficient calculations of electromagnetic (EM) wave fields. In previous investigations, it was shown that in the process of gauging ordinary electrodynamic potentials, an unintentionally changed phase velocity of certain potentials occurs in specific scenarios. Some workarounds for correction were provided there. This aspect in particular suggests as an overriding goal the desire to circumvent any kind of gauge fixing. To realize that, the unusual Whittaker potentials are utilized, which are closely related to the better known Hertz potentials. Besides reasonable propagation properties, they sometimes allow a promising reduction of equations and simplified boundary conditions. Several specifically defined frameworks based on different coordinate systems facilitate appropriate formulations. Proposed dual gauge transformations enable conversions among the two Whittaker potentials for electrodynamically coupled fields. Many detailed computational demonstrations of realistic radio frequency (RF) scenarios modeled with each Whittaker potential individually enable versatile use for practitioners. Although the idea to combine them already exists, an estimation is given to continue this endeavor. Moreover, broad applicability is emphasized by two static scenarios."

However, no models have yet been developed to describe the randomness-filled motions of biorobots, and their unique biological properties are also underutilized. In this work, the locomotion responses of a biorobot to electrical stimuli were summarized. The constant-current signal was found to have a higher capacity for sustained stimuli than existing methods. The joint influence of wall and current factors on cockroach behavior was explored to establish an environment-adaptive control model describing their locomotion. This model was then used to propose an navigation method enhanced by the inherent nature of a biorobot. In an indoor scenario, the proposed method achieved a success rate of 78.6% with minimal runtime and stimulus number while the control group using conventional navigation methods achieved a success rate of 30%, with two or three times the runtime and stimulus number. Compared with other approaches, the proposed method facilitates high-precision and long-range navigation with a short navigation time and very low control costs."

To evaluate its effectiveness, we conducted a user study (N = 28) using a custom VR archery simulation, assessing both quantitative performance metrics and qualitative user feedback. With haptic guidance, participants achieved significantly higher targeting accuracy and reported increased spatial awareness, although some also noted a reduced sense of agency. These results suggest that, while haptic assistance offers clear benefits, careful design is essential to avoid overreliance or interference with user autonomy in contexts such as accessibility, gaming, and broader human-computer interaction."

    "abstract": "Traditional zoo enrichment methods often lack flexible, non-food-based interactive elements that support animal autonomy, agency, and meaningful engagement. Enrichment that responds dynamically to animal behavior offers promising alternatives to support species-typical activities while giving animals meaningful choices in their experience. We present the design and evaluation protocol for an interactive acoustic enrichment system that transforms a familiar swing into an agency-based interface for zoo-housed black-and-white colobus monkeys (Colobus guereza). Our system maps swing amplitude to progressive soundscape layers—stream, insect, and bird sounds—allowing monkeys to control the complexity of their auditory environment through natural swinging behavior. Unlike passive enrichment, this approach gives animals direct control over their sensory experience, rewarding physical activity with increasingly rich acoustic feedback. The system offers dual audio outputs: an embedded speaker for direct animal enrichment and an external speaker for visitor education, with zookeepers controlling configuration through a mobile application. We propose a three-phase evaluation protocol comparing passive and interactive swing usage through sensor data, behavioral observations, and keeper assessments. This work contributes to Animal-Computer Interaction (ACI) research by illustrating how zoo infrastructure can be augmented into responsive interfaces, providing a methodological framework for developing species-specific, enrichment systems that give animals meaningful control over their environment."

The frequency of the appearance of these pulses is much lower than the HPM frequency. This novel phenomenon is studied in detail and a possible explanation based on the axial oscillation of the accumulated electron charge is suggested. These oscillations occur due to the axial dynamics of electron flows in an MDO which form virtual cathodes where the radius of the outer anode conductors increases relative to the radii of the magnetron anode."

Speech pre-trained models, which capture rich linguistic and phonetic representations from large-scale in-the-wild corpora, can provide this missing language knowledge to these systems.

The relativistic magnetron is a high power microwave source that is compact, has gigawatt microwave output and high beam-to-microwave efficiency from L - to C -band. A challenge for the relativistic magnetron is to operate at higher frequency regimes. The possible output power decreases at higher frequencies because electric field breakdown are reached at lower powers when the source is smaller. In addition, materials used for explosive electron emission are expected to degrade faster at higher frequencies, because high currents are emitted from smaller areas. To assess the possibilities for X-band operation, a six-cavity relativistic magnetron with a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\pi$</tex> mode to TE11 mode diffraction output was simulated in MAGIC.

Users on our application encountered two different methods of data presentation: a tabular data export page and a dynamic data visualization page. Through a user study, participants completed tasks to evaluate each method’s effectiveness in identifying specific data points, determining monthly averages, and locating peak values. Upon completion, participants voiced their opinions on which presentation tool they preferred as well as which one was more effective in progressing through the user study. Our initial quantitative hypothesis on the user study results stated that the data export page would yield a lower completion time, higher accuracy, and a higher number of clicks. After reviewing the results, the data export page had a 7.68-second lower completion time, 6.67% lower accuracy, and 13.3 more clicks compared to the data visualization page. Our results only managed to satisfy two out of three of the initial claims we had made."

This study presents a quantum-resistant underwater communication system that integrates CRYSTALS-Kyber for key encapsulation, SPHINCS+ for digital signature authentication, and AES for efficient payload encryption. The proposed system is evaluated under realistic underwater channel simulations that account for propagation delay, multipath fading, and Doppler effects. Experimental benchmarks reveal that while post-quantum operations, such as CRYSTALS-Kyber key encapsulation (2.41-4.91ms) and SPHINCS+ signing (96.10ms) exhibit higher latencies compared to classical ECC/ECDSA methods, these latencies remain within acceptable limits given the substantial security advantages they offer. This approach bridges the gap between rigorous quantum-resistant security and practical underwater deployment, establishing a robust foundation for future enhancements in error correction and adaptive network strategies."

Then, a two-tier game-theoretic framework models user strategy evolution through evolutionary dynamics, guiding the shift from isolated decisions to coordinated distributions and mitigating resource contention across edge nodes.

Precedence effect, which occurs when sounds arrive from different directions with a slight time difference, allows listeners to perceive a sound-image in the direction of the first-arriving sound. Moreover, hypersonic effect suggests that inaudible highfrequency sounds influence the perception of audible sounds. Considering the potential of ultrasound in controlling soundimage localization, we have previously proposed a sound-image augmentation method with ultrasonic signals, named pre-virtualleading hypersonic signals. In this method, a sound-image is constructed using stereo technologies, while these signals enhance directional perception. These signals are designed based on the tactile perception of ultrasounds. This method has been demonstrated to be effective in limited conditions, though the sensory perception mechanism has not yet been fully clarified. This paper focuses on whether the signals are perceived auditorily or tactilely. We conducted evaluation experiments and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method."

We propose MMoH, an efficient training approach for MLLMs on heterogeneous clusters. MMoH consists of a parallel strategy planner and an early-termination scheduler. The planner jointly considers model structure, device heterogeneity, and parameter states to select optimal parallel strategies. It first matches module requirements with device capabilities to identify feasible topologies. Then, using a hybrid-granularity abstraction, it divides the model into chunks and assigns pipeline stages accordingly. The scheduler further reduces overhead by eliminating redundant computation and communication. Experiments show that MMoH accelerates MLLM training on heterogeneous clusters by up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1.77 \\times$</tex> over state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Modern speaker recognition system relies on abundant and balanced datasets for classification training. However, diverse defective datasets, such as partially-labelled, small-scale, and imbalanced datasets, are common in real-world applications. Previous works usually studied specific solutions for each scenario from the algorithm perspective. However, the root cause of these problems lies in dataset imperfections. To address these challenges with a unified solution, we propose the Voice Conversion Augmentation (VCA) strategy to obtain pseudo speech from the training set. Furthermore, to guarantee generation quality, we designed the VCA-NN (nearest neighbours) strategy to select source speech from utterances that are close to the target speech in the representation space. Our experimental results on three created datasets demonstrated that VCA-NN effectively mitigates these dataset problems, which provides a new direction for handling the speaker recognition problems from the data aspect."

    "abstract": "Current studies on micro-expression recognition still achieve limited performance, typically yielding less than 50% accuracy. Although utilizing recent powerful models, such as Mamba, improves performance, they usually require enormous data for training. Therefore, this study proposes a regional selective mixup (RSMix) strategy that relies on facial Action Unit (AU) information to augment the dataset. The proposed approach systematically fuses facial images from micro-expressiongenerating regions with corresponding expressionless regions to synthesize new micro-expression samples. RSMix ensures that salient features from micro-expression-generating regions are preserved within these synthetic samples, facilitating the model's capacity to focus on essential visual cues for distinguishing different micro-expressions. We applied the VideoMamba model as the backbone to test the efficiency of RSMix and other augmentation methods. Experimental results on the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\operatorname{CAS}(\\text{ME})^{3}$</tex> dataset demonstrate that with RSMix, the VideoMamba-Ti model achieves an accuracy improvement of Unweighted F1-score (UF1) of 0.0138 and Unweighted average recall (UAR) of 0.0048 compared to baseline configurations without augmentation. When flip augmentation is combined with the RSMix, the VideoMambaS model achieves UF1 of 0.5040 and UAR of 0.4941, superior to the Mamba-based approach. These results prove that the RSMix approach effectively enhances data diversity, which also helps VideoMamba for the micro-expression recognition task."

The method draws inspiration from local gradient techniques used in SAR-based wind retrieval but adapts them to optical imagery with a more straightforward implementation. Using Sobel filters, dominant wave crest orientations are extracted from each image patch. After noise removal via thresholding and median filtering, wave direction is computed from edge orientations using a double-angle trigonometric averaging approach. Experiments on Thailand's coastal imagery demonstrate that the method produces robust average wave direction estimates at patch scale, offering a scalable and approach to wave pattern analysis without additional instrument installation. The experimental results show a mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.9 degrees and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 8.3 degrees, indicating a high level of agreement between the estimated and reference wave directions. Furthermore, 89.5 percent of the predictions fall within plus or minus 15 degrees of the reference values. However, the accuracy of method depends on image quality and parameter tuning, highlighting the need for consistent preprocessing."

    "abstract": "In this study, we propose a voice conversion method that replaces the decoder of DDPMVC with the consistency trajectory model (CTM), a form of diffusion model distillation. DDPMVC is a voice conversion (VC) framework that consists of an encoder that suppresses speaker information from the input speech through a forward diffusion process, and a decoder that generates the target speaker's mel-spectrogram via multi-step reverse diffusion. While this framework achieved high conversion accuracy, its major drawback is the long inference time due to the sequential nature of the sampling process. To address this issue, we introduce the CTM into the decoder of DDPMVC. CTM directly predicts the endpoint of diffusion inference and has demonstrated improved generation quality and faster sampling compared to conventional diffusion models. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms DDPMVC in voice conversion accuracy while reducing the sampling steps from thousands to just 10 steps."

Unlike most existing speech separation methods, the APSS distinguishes itself by explicitly estimating the phase spectrum for more complete and accurate separation. Specifically, APSS first extracts the amplitude and phase spectra from the mixed speech signal. Subsequently, the extracted amplitude and phase spectra are fused by a feature combiner into joint representations, which are then further processed by a deep processor with time-frequency Transformers to capture temporal and spectral dependencies. Finally, leveraging parallel amplitude and phase separators, the APSS estimates the respective spectra for each speaker from the resulting features, which are then combined via inverse short-time Fourier transform (iSTFT) to reconstruct the separated speech signals. Experimental results indicate that APSS surpasses both time-domain separation methods and implicit-phase-estimation-based time-frequency approaches. Also, APSS achieves stable and competitive results on multiple datasets, highlighting its strong generalization capability and practical applicability."

The potential of transformation involved in determining the molecular signatures and drug targets in LN is inherent in the artificial intelligence (AI) and bioinformatics combination.Methods: We compared transcriptomic data in the GEO database, GSE32591 and GSE81622 with AI-based bioinformatics pipelines to determine the DEGs). The selection of features and prioritization of genes were done through the network-based machine learning algorithm, which was applied to the protein-protein networks formed through the use of STRING and visualized in Cytoscape. Topological AI ranking techniques of cytoHubba were used to extract hub genes. The verification of the gene expression across tissue types was conducted using integrated transcriptomic atlases (Bgee, HPA) and drug and gene interactions had to be mapped to the DGIDB database using AI-assisted pitfalls.Results: The common set of DEGs (CDEGs) were made up of 78 datasets. The AI-based enrichment proved that the above genes were functionally important in regulating ribonuclease and the NOD-like receptor signaling. Multi-algorithmic centrality scoring evaluate the centrality scores EIF2AK2, IFIT1, IFIT3, MX1, OAS1, OAS2. Their spatial confirmation of the expression of kidney tissue RNA and proteomics was done. One of the possible treatments, which was produced as a result of AI-created drug repositioning, was the IL-3 blockade.Conclusion: This article has shown that the AI-enhanced bioinformatics is powerful to identify meaningful molecular pathways and therapeutic hints in LN. The precision nephrology and the future AI-based diagnostic models are based on the identified hub genes and the drug targets."

    "abstract": "Modern switches commonly employ fixed sampling rates, which often fail to capture congested flows due to their reduced packet rates, ultimately resulting in low flow visibility. However, many network management applications such as traffic engineering and security analysis require high flow visibility to identify congested bottleneck links or detect anomalies. Although some adaptive sampling methods have been proposed, they suffer from scalability issues for requiring per-flow real-time packet rates, which are extremely complicated, expensive and imprecise to track. In this paper, we present CAsample, a congestion-aware adaptive packet sampling framework based on Software-Defined Network (SDN) paradigm to solve the above issues. The key idea of CAsample is to adaptively update sampling strategies, indicating which switch should sample which flow at what sampling rate, by sensing per-flow congestion degree. Specifically, CAsample detects the per-flow congestion degree by estimating switch queue lengths and packet RTT. We then establish a relationship between flow rate and traffic congestion degree following the ideas of TCP Reno congestion control and Random Early Detection. Finally, to maximize the flow visibility, we formulate an optimization problem, then propose a corresponding low-complexity near-optimal solution. We compare CAsample with state-of-the-art methods in small-scale Mininet testbed and large-scale simulation experiments. The results demonstrate that CAsample achieves an average 21.5% improvement in flow visibility while reducing the network sampling load by 17.2%."

    "abstract": "Infrared and visible image fusion combines complementary information from both modalities to produce a single image that enhances human perception and supports high-level tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection. Most existing fusion methods assume perfectly aligned infrared and visible image pairs, an assumption that rarely holds in realworld scenarios due to spatial misalignment, frame drops, and differences in resolution or field of view. While recent approaches can handle minor misalignments under equal resolution, more robust alignment strategies are needed for significant discrepancies. Furthermore, current fusion datasets lack semantic and object annotations, limiting the development of task-driven models. To address these challenges, we propose a new method for constructing a fusion dataset enriched with semantic segmentation labels. We apply style transfer to existing annotated datasets to generate synthetic infrared-visible image pairs tailored to target applications. These images are used to retrain segmentation models, creating datasets with needed annotations. For spatial alignment, we estimate scaling and translation using logarithmic polar transformations and the Fourier Transform. To handle temporal misalignment, we integrate spatial alignment with mask matching to maximize object overlap between paired frames. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in aligning infrared and visible image pairs."

It applies the TensorFlow to train the system, that can operate in real-time based on the scale of recognition of different retail products based on shelf images.

    "abstract": "This paper considers adaptive event-triggered stabilization for a class of uncertain time-varying nonlinear systems. Remarkably, the systems contain intrinsic time-varying unknown parameters which are allowed to be non-differentiable and in turn can be fast-varying. Moreover, the systems admit unknown control directions. To counteract the different uncertainties, more than one compensation mechanism has to be incorporated. However, in the context of event-triggered control, ensuring the effectiveness of these compensation mechanisms under reduced execution necessitates delicate design and analysis. This paper proposes a tight and powerful strategy for adaptive event-triggered control (ETC) by integrating the state-of-the-art adaptive techniques. In particular, the strategy substantially mitigates the conservatism caused by repetitive inequality-based treatments of uncertainties. Specifically, by leveraging the congelation-of-variables method and tuning functions, the conservatism in the treatment of the fast-varying parameters is significantly reduced. With multiple Nussbaum functions employed to handle unknown control directions, a set of dynamic compensations is designed to counteract unknown amplitudes of control coefficients without relying on inequality-based treatments. Moreover, a dedicated dynamic compensation is introduced to deal with the control coefficient coupled with the execution error, based on which a relative-threshold event-triggering mechanism (ETM) is rigorously validated. It turns out that the adaptive event-triggered controller achieves the closed-loop convergence while guaranteeing a uniform lower bound for inter-execution times. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed strategy."

To overcome the gimbal lock problem inherent in Euler angle representation, unit quaternions are adopted to model the AUV, accounting for internal uncertainties and external disturbances. Then, an improved time-varying function is introduced, which serves as the basis for designing a non-singular sliding surface and sliding mode controller with PdT stability. This approach ensures that the tracking errors converge within a predefined time, independent of initial conditions and design parameters. Compared with traditional PdT controllers, the proposed method eliminates singularities, enhances the precision of convergence time estimation, and typically yields smaller, smoother initial control inputs, thus improving its potential for engineering applications. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed controller."

The shared buffer architecture of data centers with Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) differs from that of traditional data centers.

Ingress shared buffer management differs significantly from egress management, as it employs Priority-based Flow Control (PFC) with multiple thresholds to buffer packets and pause upstream devices to minimize packet loss. The widely used ingress shared buffer management method, DT, suffers from deep queue depth and limited burst absorption capability. We propose a novel ingress shared buffer management method called ISBM, which includes threshold flipping and periodic threshold updating mechanisms. To our knowledge, this is the first work to improve flow performance in data centers with RDMA by optimizing ingress shared buffer management. The evaluation results demonstrate that ISBM significantly reduces the number of pause frames and improves the flow completion time of short flows up to 35%."

    "abstract": "High load current pulses with high repetitive rates are critical for applications such as fusion research, rail guns, and similar fields. Superconducting pulsed transformers are used in inductive pulsed power supply to improve energy transfer efficiency and reduce resistive losses. Previously, a twowinding superconducting pulsed power transformer was used. However, it suffers from overvoltage spikes across the opening switch and limited load current. In this work, a three-winding pulsed transformer (TWPT) is proposed. It consists of two primary windings using superconducting material and a secondary copper winding. Four coil stacking designs were simulated using Ansys Maxwell and an optimized coil stacking design was obtained based on coupling performance, magnetic field distribution, and load current capacity. A prototype TWPT was then constructed using superconducting tape (rare-earth barium copper oxide (ReBCO) at room temperature), each primary with 160 turns. The corresponding transformer coupling coefficients (Kpip2, Kp1s, and Kp2s) obtained from simulations are 82.9%, 83.7%, and 83.7%, and from experiment 78.3%, 78.7%, and 77.5%, respectively, with an acceptable difference of about 4. 6% – 6. 2%. A superconducting pulsed power supply (SPPS) was then designed using Ansys Simplorer to determine optimum repetitive rate and output current capacity. Four thyristor switching sequence modes (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{M}_{1}-\\mathrm{M}_{4}$</tex>) and 16 timing combinations (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{C}_{1}-\\mathrm{C}_{16}$</tex>) were analysed.

(2021). A small-scale prototype of the SPPS was developed based on the obtained optimum design with the TWPT maintained at 72 K. A peak load current of 140 A (compared to about 80 A, at room temperature) was achieved with 7.5 A charging current at a repetition rate of 25 Hz."

It connects both design and manufacturing processes and bridge the gap between machine processing Accuracy and assembly reliability. Effective tolerance analysis technology and allocation models play a pivotal role in providing precise data to enhance product design efficiency, reduce costs, and elevate product quality. This study proposed a novel tolerance allocation model that formulates a mathematical framework by considering the structural significance of tolerance nodes, tolerance-cost model, resilience evaluation parameters based on dynamic process capability index, and quality loss cost function. Moreover, it accounts for machining tool degradation disturbances during the manufacturing process to imbue the tolerance allocation scheme with greater system resilience. The proposed model is exemplified through a case study on the assembly size chain of a specific engine, juxtaposed against two conventional tolerance allocation methods, namely the equal tolerance method and equal precision method. The findings reveal that the proposed tolerance allocation scheme in this study minimizes the overall cost effectively."

By fusing the landing gear fault physical model, adaptive threshold and the data-driven method, we compare the fault physical model with the real operation data to quantify the landing gear operation state and input it into the prediction network as features. The prediction network adopts AE-LSTM (proposed), which can reduce the prediction error and provide more robust fault prediction results than traditional RNN and ARIMA, and enhance the fault prediction and health management capability of aerospace system equipment."

Some studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of delivering Motivational Interviews (MIs), a patient-centred behaviour change method, with ECAs. Despite showing promise, the effect of agent communication style on MI effectiveness remains underexplored. Directness has been shown to impact satisfaction and preference of dialogue systems, and effectiveness in some cases. However, outside of verbal style, how to control directness in ECAs to achieve these goals is not well understood. We designed an ECA to convey different levels of directness through language and Non-Verbal behaviours (NVBs), then evaluated the impact of language and NVB on directness with a perception study. The results showed that language influenced perceived directness, and that NVB contributed when aligned with indirect language. These findings suggest ways to shape conversational agents’ communication style to enhance their effectiveness."

However, its performance significantly degrades under sparseview settings, resulting in incomplete geometry and severe texture artifacts. To overcome these limitations, we propose DP-GS (Depth-prior & Perception-guided Gaussian Splatting), a unified framework designed for sparse-view NVS. DP-GS integrates depth regularization derived from monocular depth estimation to improve geometric completeness. Moreover, we introduce a point-level dropout mechanism to suppress unreliable points, and integrate perceptual optimization guided by diffusion model to enhance texture fidelity and structural consistency. Extensive experiments on LLFF and Mip-NeRF360 datasets demonstrate that DP-GS consistently outperforms existing 3DGS methods under sparse view settings."

With climate change accelerating, these disasters are increasingly unpredictable, particularly in vulnerable regions such as forests and deserts. Therefore, we developed a model that is scalable in remote regions of Oman and the rest of the Gulf Cooperation Council Regions for enhancing disaster resilience, optimizing resource allocation, and situational awareness of a situation. The model enables a long-term solution to improving disaster management infrastructure in climate-exposed areas since performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, F1-score, and false alarm rate ensure high reliability. The system enables real-time responsiveness through edge data processing, the detection of anomalies, and the prediction of high-risk environmental events. Following initial edge-level analysis, data is transmitted to cloud platforms for further processing. Upon identifying potential threats, the system disseminates geofenced, multilingual alerts to affected individuals and first responders via mobile applications, wearable technologies, and public dashboards. The developed Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled smart system enhances the management of sandstorms and landslides, particularly in vulnerable regions. The system also integrates automated alert mechanisms to deliver timely warnings through mobile devices. It leverages edge computing, IoT sensor networks, geographic information systems (GIS), and GPS, complemented by cloud-based machine learning algorithms such as random forest and gradient boosting for predictive modeling. The system incorporates accelerometers, soil moisture sensors, particulate matter (PM) sensors, and geophones to monitor environmental and geotechnical conditions.

This research presents a methodology for forecasting weariness on the job consuming physiological data gathered on or after wearable sensors and based on machine learning. Features were identified and processed to detect patterns indicative of stress and tiredness using the WESAD dataset, which incorporates multimodal biosignals such as electromagnetic activity (EMA), core body temperature (CBT), heart rate variability (HRV), and accelerometer data. Using annotated labels aligned with affective states, a Gradient Boosting framework including XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost was evaluated to classify fatigue levels. To make the system more resilient and less noisy, a lot of feature engineering and signal preprocessing were used. The LightGBM classifier has the best AUC, precision, F1score, accuracy, and recall among the models that were assessed. These results show that it is possible to anticipate fatigue states in real time with non-invasive wearables and little extra computing power. The suggested system is the first step toward making adaptive workload and shift management systems operate in hospitals. Future enhancements will investigate dynamic scheduling and ergonomic optimization through real-time tiredness feedback. To make sure that AI is used responsibly in healthcare settings, ethical issues like data protection and model interpretability are talked about.

    "abstract": "With the advent of 6G, extreme services such as autonomous vehicles demand efficient network management to meet stringent quality of service requirements. Network function virtualization decouples services from hardware via service function chains (SFCs), which is composed of multiple virtual network functions. Ensuring reliable SFC scheduling while efficiently using resources remains a challenge in dynamic and resource-constrained multi-cluster networks. However, most existing methods neglect admission co-optimization during SFC resources allocation, compromising long-term system stability. In this paper, we propose TRH-Scheduler, a topology-aware revenue-driven hierarchical scheduler for multi-cluster SFC orchestration. Specifically, the TRH-Scheduler decouples spatiotemporal decision via a two-stage mechanism and employs hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) to successively complete the two stages, a queue agent for admission control, and a deployment agent for resource allocation. Furthermore, graph neural networks (GNNs) are leveraged to encode topological information, optimizing the awareness of HRL agents. Through extensive evaluation, the results demonstrate more than 4.36% improvement in average revenue and 11.84% improvement in acceptance rate over baseline methods."

However, existing scheduling strategies often prioritize assigning tasks to the most powerful GPUs to minimize latency, frequently causing overheating, thermal throttling, and consequent performance degradation. To address this critical issue, we propose iTrap, a novel scheduler that proactively mitigates thermal throttling by integrating thermal awareness into GPU cluster management. iTrap identifies heat-intensive tasks and strategically places them on accelerator groups with superior thermal dissipation capabilities. It leverages task-specific temperature predictions to minimize throttling risks while balancing accelerator hardware performance and cross-GPU communication overhead, optimizing for both high performance and low inter-device communication costs. Evaluations on large-scale production traces from Microsoft demonstrate that iTrap outperforms PAL, the state-of-the-art scheduler, by reducing average task completion time by 23.6% and P99 completion time by 26.0%. The gains from iTrap further highlight the importance of thermal-aware scheduling in unlocking the full potential of GPU clusters for AI work-loads."

The CGNOS model is tested on CKD data set available at Kaggle, and compared with classical machine learning approaches including SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and simple CNNs. The peak accuracy of the proposed model reached 98.6% compared to the baseline models such as CNN (94.2%), Random Forest (93.1%), and SVM (91.5%). Further performance indicators that show the stability of CGNOS are the precision (98.1%), recall (99.0%), and F1-score (98.5%). Moreover, feature set size was also considerably minimized to 14 by the aid of the feature subset optimization without sacrificing the diagnostic performance that was originally 25. Such findings show that CGNOS can not only facilitate more accurate diagnoses but it can demonstrate enhanced interpretability and scalability toward real-world adoption in clinical practice. The combination of gene expression profiling and clinical characteristics provides a instrument in early screening of CKD and thus more direct and individual treatment techniques."

This study presents a comparative analysis between three methods: manual analysis using ImageJ, instrumentation-based measurement via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and automatic segmentation with a Python implemented Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Results show that CNN-based segmentation closely approximates porosity values obtained from ImageJ 18.6% and SEM 19.16%, demonstrating high reliability with a CNN result of 17.73%. While ImageJ and CNN use the same input derived from images generated by the SEM machine, ImageJ relies on subjective manual interpretation, whereas CNN provides a fully automated analysis pipeline. The findings highlight CNN’s capacity to process high-resolution SEM images efficiently while minimizing human bias. Notably, this study provides one of the first direct comparisons between CNN, ImageJ, and SEM for wound dressing evaluation, underscoring the potential of deep learning in biomedical material analysis. CNN-based approaches are promising for future wound dressing assessments, especially in resource-limited or high-throughput environments."

    "abstract": "The inductively driven transmission line (IDTL) is a current monitor commonly fielded on the Z Pulsed Power Facility in recent years [1]. The IDTL passively couples to the magnetic field in the final power feed on the Z machine, redirecting a small amount of Z's magnetic energy along a secondary path to ground. A pair of oppositely oriented B-dot monitors measure the current in the secondary circuit enabling common mode noise cancellation. Experimental data show the IDTLs measure cleaner signals and are more robust than the conventional B-dot, which was previously used to measure the current in the final power feed on the Z Pulsed Power Facility. Recent simulations (modeled in COMSOL Multiphysics) and calibration measurements have identified a discrepancy in sensitivity of the two IDTL B-dot monitors of up to a factor of two [2]. This difference in sensitivity could be due to a difference in the environment that each Bdot loop in the monitor is sensing. As common mode rejection assumes that each B-dot loop in the monitor have the same input signal, rejecting a signal that is not common to both would be difficult to interpret. Moreover, the difference in B-dot loop measurement raises an uncertainty of which B-dot loop signal is correct, which results in low confidence in being able to measure the main current pulse. A re-design and its performance on the Z Pulsed Power Facility will be presented."

How to develop a rapid automated method for determining accessible paths in complex maintenance scenarios has become a current research focus. To solve the problem, this study proposes a path search method based on the improved forward and backward inverse kinematics (FABRIK) algorithm. By analyzing the limitations of the traditional FABRIK algorithm in terms of convergence and obstacle avoidance, an optimization mechanism incorporating a random rotation strategy is designed to effectively solve the problems of local optima and obstacle avoidance. At the same time, a 7 degree of freedom human arm kinematic model was constructed to constrain joint range of motion with ergonomic. The effectiveness of the algorithm was validated in a virtual environment, and the results showed that the method can plan accessible paths that conform to human motion characteristics in a 3D scene with obstacles. This method can provide effective solutions for the maintenance design of complex industrial equipment."

    "abstract": "Autonomous electric vehicles, such as Micro Electric Vehicles (MEVi), are expected to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and lower greenhouse gas emissions. However, the performance of the steering motor system, which is affected by external factors such as road surface type and load distribution, still requires further study. For this reason, this study collected data on the current of steering motor using an ACS758 sensor on two types of road surfaces (epoxy and concrete) and two load conditions (all wheels touching the surface and rear tire lifted). The purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of road surface conditions and load distribution on the characteristics of the electric current generated by the steering motor in MEVi. The results show that smoother road surfaces (epoxy) produce a more stable current distribution, while rougher surfaces (concrete) cause a wider current distribution. Machine learning algorithms, such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), were used to classify the road surface type and steering position. SVM provided the best accuracy in road type classification with 79% accuracy. This study suggests adding other variables, such as voltage and power, to improve classification accuracy and maximize the performance of prediction models in autonomous electric vehicle steering systems."

    "abstract": "Growing demand for large-scale time-series data storage has rendered floating-point time-series compression a key technology for better storage efficiency and performance. General-purpose compression rely on exact matching to build dictionaries, making them effective for repetitive data but unsuitable for time-series data with small fluctuations and gradual changes. While time-series-specialized compression leverage correlations between adjacent data points, they ignore long-term similarities and periodic patterns. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient Dynamic-Dictionary-Based Compression (DDC) algorithm for floating-point time-series data. DDC uses three matching strategies to capture both local patterns and global trends. It dynamically updates the dictionary and adapts its compression strategy during processing. Moreover, DDC reduces precision redundancy by adjusting mantissa bit lengths and separating floating-point components. We evaluate DDC against state-of-theart time-series-specific (Gorilla, Chimp, AFC, TSXor, FPC) and general-purpose (LZ4, LZW, Snappy) compression algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that DDC achieves superior compression ratios and faster processing speeds, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality."

    "abstract": "The roller heat treatment process involves sending rollers into different-sized heating furnaces, with energy consumption varying by furnace size. Therefore, utilizing the furnaces by heating multiple rollers simultaneously in the same furnace can effectively reduce furnace usage frequency and lower energy consumption. Current research mainly focuses on batch scheduling rather than optimizing roller distribution. Moreover, existing studies predominantly use heuristic algorithms like Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Simulated Annealing (SA), which are unable to make sequential decisions. Field investigations indicate that most enterprises rely on laborintensive, inefficient manual scheduling for heat treatment. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel approach based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for roller heat treatment workshop scheduling. The optimization objective of the distribution scheduling is to minimize the total cost of the workshop while taking into account various loading strategies, including furnace width, stacking limits, and heating time. The total cost is the sum of inventory cost, energy consumption cost, and delay cost. This study constructs a mathematical model that frames the heat treatment process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and introduces the Q-learning algorithm to dynamically determine the optimal scheduling strategy for the workshop that meets the heat treatment constraints. Research shows our method efficiently optimizes roller heat treatment scheduling, enhancing the efficiency of production scheduling and reducing energy consumption."

Patchout faSt Spectrogram Transformer (PaSST) is an efficient transformer model for audio classification. Its core innovation is Patchout, a token-dropping mechanism. Patchout reduces computational demands and improves model generalization by shortening the input sequence. However, its random patch selection strategy may lead to the loss of crucial information. This loss hinders full feature learning, especially for structurally rich music. Therefore, we proposed a novel Attention-based Adaptive Structured Patchout (AASPatchout). It deterministically preserves the most informative patches by using the transformer's internal attention scores. Our AASPatchout requires no additional modules, instead directly utilizing the model's existing attention mechanism. We evaluated AASPatchout for two downstream tasks in music classification: polyphonic instrument recognition and music genre classification. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed method outperformed the conventional random Patchout baseline."

Through experimental results, it is illustrated that the offered model performs better than conventional classifiers in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall.

By combining Integrated Gradients with a hybrid elbow-point method, we identify sparse subsets of embedding dimensions that are sufficient to retain classification performance. Interestingly, one dimension Dimension 414 consistently emerges as the most influential across layers and features, suggesting that WavLM concentrates phonetic information into compact and functionally distinct dimensions. Supporting correlation analysis with handcrafted acoustic descriptors reveals that this dominant dimension aligns with interpretable speech properties. Our findings demonstrate that WavLM embeddings encode phonetic features in a sparse, structured, and explainable manner, offering new pathways for transparent and efficient speech model analysis."

To address this limitation, this paper proposes a digital twindriven O&M optimization method. Multi-dimensional digital twin models including a physics-based model, a data-driven model, and an O&M knowledge model are constructed. Considering the impacts of equipment degradation and maintenance activities on the physical entity, a dynamic model update scheme is proposed to ensure the consistency between the digital twin models and the state of the physical system. A case study on a 5 MW benchmark wind turbine demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach in enhancing the intelligence of wind turbine O&M decision-making, thereby supporting the practical application of digital twin technology in the wind power sector."

We present a new Fuzzy-Based Logical Clustering Network Formation protocol that optimizes total WSN lifetime to fuzzy inference used to intelligently select Cluster Head (CH). The model has considered three crucial parameters of Residual Energy, Node Degree and Distance to Base Station (DBS) to calculate Cluster Head Suitability Score (CHSS) through Mamdani fuzzy logic. Segmentation based on logical zones guarantees a spatial fairness in CH distribution, and supports intra-cluster communication with: clock cycle based TDMA; aggregation of data transmitted. Numerical simulation proves that network life, energy consumption, and data integrity have been improved significantly. The proposed model significantly beats the typical communications such as LEACH, HEED, and EECDA in terms of the main metrics. The model achieves an accuracy of 94.7% in CH selection—validated against optimal energy conditions—and extends the first node death (FND) to 1290 rounds and last node death (LND) to 2240 rounds, compared to 780 and 1650 rounds in LEACH, respectively. The Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) stays substantially about 90% to 1200 rounds and even higher than the state-of-art criteria. These performances validate the usefulness of fuzzy-based logical clustering approach to the extension of WSN life time, balanced consumption, and reliable data transmission. Our proposed solution can be promising in environmental surveillance, intelligent crop management, as well as surveillance in the battlefield due to their large-scale and energy-limited nature."

First, the cascading failure mechanisms and recovery strategies (e.g., parameter weight adjustment, redundancy switching) in typical CNN systems such as SAFETERM are analyzed, serving as the foundation for establishing a real-time game-theoretic model characterizing fault propagation and dynamic recovery. Subsequently, we evaluate system reliability through performance margin assessment under multi-source uncertainties, specifically addressing multi-factor coupled effects in cross-level fault propagation chains. Finally, rigorous validation of the proposed method's effectiveness and practicality is performed via an aviation accident investigation where improper sensor data fusion weighting was identified as the root cause. This methodology enables real-time, precise monitoring of intelligent systems' health status, thereby significantly enhancing aviation safety."

    "abstract": "Spark gap discharges have gained growing interest due to their utility in diverse high-voltage applications such as surge protection, power switching, and high-energy laser triggering. A major limitation of gas-filled spark gap switches is the inherent timing jitter largely due to the stochastic nature of discharge initiation, which affects their precision and repeatability. Laser triggering, by inducing pre-ionization in the gap through a focused laser pulse, is a promising approach to mitigate this issue. The laser-generated seed electrons facilitate avalanche and streamer formation, promoting faster breakdown and arc formation. Nevertheless, the inherent randomness in ionization dynamics remains a key factor in timing jitter, underscoring the need for deeper investigation."

    "abstract": "Existing dataset recommendation (rec) systems including those named as ZhangRec23, WangRec22, and GDS19, face certain limitations, such as lack of focus on e-commerce datasets, inability to address complex queries, and reliance on inconsistent metadata (e.g., data structure of domain of products being recommended). This leads to incomplete or mismatched results returned by the system for complex query searches, such as \"impact of seasonal sales on customer reviews for electronics\". These traditional dataset rec systems rely on simple keyword matching, failing to interpret context-sensitive queries that researchers often need, and are unable to capture the dynamic trends in the e-commerce domain. This highlights the need for an advanced dataset rec system that improves metadata quality and integrates semantic understanding to recommend precise and relevant e-commerce datasets to researchers. This paper proposes an E-commerce Datasets Mining Rec System (EDMRec), an adaptation of ZhangRec23 approach. EDMRec combines content-based filtering, advanced metadata processing, and machine learning approach in a three-layered structure involving (i) Data Collection, (ii)Data Processing, and (iii) Query Processing. It utilizes Named Entity Recognition (NER) to complete metadata and uses TF-IDF with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) embeddings to capture both keyword relevance and semantic context, enhancing recommendation precision for complex queries. Experimental results show that EDMRec improves precision, recall, and F1 score by 15% over existing systems, consistently providing contextually accurate recommendations across 4,373 metadata entries from sources such as Kaggle and Google Dataset Search, making it well-suited for supporting data-driven insights in e-commerce."

In this study, we adapt ProtoPNets for critical care EEG analysis by computing similarity between class-specific prototypes and EEG segments across all time windows and electrodes.

To identify graphs with time-varying weights, we propose a novel state-dependent model (SDM), integrating the linear time-varying sparse vector autoregressive model (SVAR) and nonlinear SVAR model. SDM models the time-varying property through feedback mechanisms that incorporate past graph signals, and extends the time-varying smoothness regularizer for model identification. We use the kernel method based on random Fourier features to formulate a convex optimization problem for identification, and propose an effective ADMM-based algorithm. Numerical results on synthetic datasets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing SVAR-based models, and demonstrate the importance of time-varying smoothness regularizer. Furthermore, experiments on US Senator ideology data showcase the model's interpretability, revealing state associations consistent with known political alignments."

This study proposes a modified blade element–momentum (BEM) model that incorporates wind shear and tower-shadow models into the classical BEM framework. Using theoretical analysis supported by case studies, the modified model quantifies how wind shear and tower shadow cause time-varying fluctuations in axial force and power output at blade and rotor scales. Results indicate that wind shear and tower shadow reduce the axial load and power output of individual blades when they rotate toward the tower, reaching minimum values at the 180° azimuth position. For the rotor as a whole, three local minima in axial force and power output are observed during one revolution, occurring at azimuth angles of 60°, 180°, and 300°. The results highlight tower shadow as the dominant factor influencing these periodic fluctuations"

    "abstract": "Military personnel must remain in strong physical and mental health to carry out their duties. However, many chronic diseases like diabetes can develop silently over time. If detected early, the risk can often be managed with changes in routine, diet, or medication. Yet early detection relies on access to health data, and for military applications, that data is often sensitive and highly confidential. Most AI systems that predict health risks do not include strong privacy safeguards or consent control. This paper presents a secure health monitoring system designed specifically for military environments. The system combines AI with blockchain to ensure privacy, transparency, and individual control. It uses Pure Chain to manage access permissions through smart contracts. Military personnel must explicitly grant consent before their data is used for analysis. The health data, stored securely through IPFS, is only shared with the AI model after consent is confirmed. The AI model predicts health risks. Once a prediction is made, the result is sent securely to the respective personnel through a Flask-based backend. This way, the system maintains privacy while enabling timely health warnings. The model achieved 90.13% accuracy in cross-validation, 82.89% test accuracy, and an AUC of 0.90, showing strong potential for real-world deployment."

    "abstract": "As industrial upgrading progresses, industrial chains have evolved from simple linear structures into intricate networks, making task assignment increasingly challenging. Concurrently, the intricate task architectures have heightened the complexity of personnel management, indirectly driving up corporate costs. In this context, identifying effective approaches to task assignment and grouping has emerged as a critical and daunting issue within such intricate task environments. The absence of adequate quantitative tools has impeded progress in computationally investigating the Networked Task Allocations Problem (NTAP) for industry chains, even though addressing it is critically needed. Notably, the Environment-Classes, Agents, Roles, Groups, and Objects (E-CARGO) model—a robust framework proven effective through maturity—has consistently shown efficacy in research concerning such social challenges. This article formalizes and explores the NTAP by leveraging the E-CARGO model and its sub-model Group Role Assignment (GRA). The weighted GRA prioritizes task allocation based on their priority level within the industrial network. To address task grouping challenges, we employ K-Means clustering to categorize tasks into clusters exhibiting typical topological characteristics. This approach not only boosts corporate cost efficiency and operational effectiveness but also strategically strengthens bottleneck tasks within the industrial chain, thus reducing the risk of single-point failures."

    "abstract": "In today's business environment, accurately forecasting warranty reserves and managing spare parts inventory is essential. Effective failure modeling underpins warranty forecasting, yet dynamic modeling of complex products presents challenges due to interdependencies in component failures. This research explores system-level failure dynamics using a multilayer network approach. Traditional models often simplify systems into series or parallel configurations, neglecting cascading failures and seepage effects. Additionally, many studies rely on singlelayer networks, which inadequately capture short-term interdependencies in product degradation. Our objective is to develop a complex network framework with event-time adjustments. Using failure data from a taxi company, we create a temporal multilayer network where product components are nodes, and edges represent failure sequences. Inter-layer edges connect corresponding nodes across layers. By assigning weights to edges, we define an event-time multilayer network. Results show a strong correlation between component reliability and temporal claim frequency in inter-layer analysis, while intra-layer analysis reveals a powerlaw distribution characteristic of scale-free networks. Moreover, conditional reliability highlights the significance of components in relation to the overall system. The proposed supracentrality matrix offers a systematic framework to enhance maintenance and warranty decision-making in complex systems."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, the automotive industries rely on the massive connections of ECUs to communicate among the advanced devices used in a vehicle. This integration of advanced technologies may result in the complexity of systems in the network. For decades, the Controller Area Network (CAN) has been the dominant protocol for communication among Electronic Control Units (ECUs) within vehicles. In this project, the CAN protocol is employed to regulate the speed of a DC motor, with both KVASER CAN interfaces and PCAN-USB used to send and monitor CAN messages. Also, a closed loop analysis of the speed control of DC motor is employed through a Spider Monkey Optimized PID controller for the steady control of the DC motor.Traditionally, automotive systems have relied on a security-through-obscurity model. However, this approach is increasingly vulnerable, as in-vehicle networks can be reverse-engineered and manipulated with even consumer-grade tools. To address on this drawback, the project integrates a Hash-Based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) mechanism into the CAN communication process to verify message integrity and authenticity. An experimental setup demonstrates motor speed control using authenticated CAN messages, and the results of this secure implementation are presented."

    "abstract": "The calibration of rotating interferometers in real-world applications is critically challenged by complex, coupled systematic errors that render traditional model-based methods ineffective. While deep learning methods offer a powerful alternative, their practical application is hindered by the scarcity of labeled training data, the “black-box” nature of most networks, and their vulnerability to measurement noise. This paper presents a comprehensive strategy that addresses these limitations. We first develop a weakly-supervised labeling scheme that generates training data from non-cooperative sources, removing the reliance on dedicated emitters. Then we design a domain-knowledge-infused network to enhance the interpretability by explicitly modeling key physical quantities to learn their nonlinear couplings. Moreover, a novel inverse-solved feature is proposed to ensure robustness against measurement noise, which provides a denoised, temporally coherent input for the network. On field-collected data where model-based algorithms fail to converge, the proposed approach is shown to reduce positioning error by 34.48%, demonstrating its practical value."

Thematic text analysis using qualitative feedback and descriptive pattern recognition using quantitative data were incorporated into the evaluation process to enable a structured finding of strengths, weaknesses, and areas of curricular improvement using artificial intelligence (AI). Students identified benefits of interdisciplinary learning, technical learning and useful strategies of engagement. Nonetheless, they also reported such issues as lack of visual materials, excessive complexity of the material, and no chance to practice in real life.Purpose: The purpose of the assessment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a renal dialysis program consisting of an elective program with the help of AI-supported feedback analysis to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the educational program and the opportunities to improve the program.Procedure: It was a qualitative descriptive study, which included five fourth-year MBBS students. Open-ended forms, structured logbooks and supervisor evaluations were used to collect the data that were further processed by qualitative coding tools based on AI-driven thematic clustering and visualization.Findings: Lectures on haemodialysis, CKD screening, intradialytic complications, management of long-term complications, and cardiovascular risk factors seemed to be well-received. The analysis of the collected data with the help of AI was confirmed to have recurrent themes, such as the lack of visual aid, outdated references, as well as insufficient use of case-based methods. The suggestions were incorporation of simulations, betterment in multimedia teaching aids as well as fine tuning lecture pace.Conclusion: The results of the evaluation process with the integration of AI were more comprehensive and revealed the necessity to improve teaching aids, improve the design of lectures, and increase the correspondence between theory and practice. Such results indicate that AI can be useful in the assessment of medical curricula, including the creation of more interactive and centred clinical electives to students."

    "abstract": "The widespread use of speaker identification technology has raised concerns regarding personal information contained in voice data, particularly voice privacy. While the application of adversarial attacks is a potential protection measure for this issue, the extent to which their attack effectiveness is maintained across speaker embedding extractors with different architectures (a property known as transferability) is not yet well understood. In this study, we experimentally evaluated the transferability of adversarial audio generated using the I-FGSM method. The evaluation targeted three types of speaker embedding extractors with different architectures: X-vector, Titanet, MelStyleEncoder and ECAPA-TDNN. We evaluated attack effectiveness using identification accuracy and the Equal Error Rate, and assessed audio quality using PESQ, which predicts subjective listening quality, and SI-SDR, which measures signal fidelity. The experimental results showed that in black-box attacks, attacks from models like X-vector to ECAPA-TDNN exhibited high transferability, while an asymmetrical relationship was observed where the reverse direction had low transferability. Furthermore, a clear tradeoff between attack strength and audio quality was confirmed. These results indicate that adversarial audio can affect not only a single model but also other models, suggesting its effectiveness as a technology for voice privacy protection."

The SEDREAMS method detects GCIs by identifying peaks in LPC residual within candidate intervals determined from mean-based signals. However, LPC analysis may not adequately separate glottal excitation from vocal tract characteristics, especially in low frequencies. This paper proposes replacing LPC residual signals with complex ones from Time-Varying Complex AR (TVCAR) analysis of analytic signals. TV-CAR provides improved low-frequency estimation by eliminating negative frequency components. Experiments on the CMU Arctic database demonstrate that TV-CAR-based SEDREAMS achieves better identification detection rates than conventional LPC-based methods, particularly for male speakers. This paper proposes a method to estimate the GCI using the TV-CAR method."

We compared two analytical approaches: a macroanalysis of entire 8-second audio clips and a micro-analysis of individually detected bowel sound events. Using data collected from a single subject, multiple machine learning models were evaluated for their ability to classify audio as either belonging to a specific time window before defecation (ranging from 10 to 270 minutes) or to other times. The results consistently showed that the macro-analysis outperformed the micro-analysis in overall discriminative performance. A CNN-BiLSTM model achieved the highest performance in the macro-analysis, with a peak AUC of 0.76 for the 60-minute pre-defecation window. A subsequent statistical analysis revealed that this performance difference is attributable to a significant increase in the frequency and total duration of bowel sound events prior to defecation (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$p&lt;0.001$</tex>, <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$r=0.378$</tex>). These findings indicate that the quantitative density of bowel sound events is a more dominant indicator for detecting defecation premonition than the qualitative acoustic characteristics of individual sounds. This suggests that focusing on event frequency analysis is a more promising direction for developing non-invasive prediction systems."

Unlike human participants, UAVs have high flexibility and controllability and can provide reliable support for emergency situations such as disasters and traffic congestion. We consider a UAV-assisted SC (USC) task with the goal of maximizing the amount of data collection, geographic fairness among points of interest, and minimizing UAV energy consumption. However, many existing studies have neglected the importance of communication between UAVs, resulting in unnecessary competition and difficulty in effectively perceiving global tasks. To this end, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning method with an efficient communication mechanism, named DRLMcs_ECA, which can enhance information interaction between UAVs and reduce communication overhead, thereby promoting collaboration between UAVs. Extensive simulation experiments show that DRLMcs_ECA outperforms the baseline method and improves overall energy efficiency while reducing communication overhead."

Most deep learning algorithms conceal this mechanism in a latent space through end-to-end optimization. In addition, the computational requirements for training and inference increase exponentially with the video length. To address interoperability and efficiency, we propose an interpretable video-text alignment (VTA) method in this work. Through keyframe selection and genre clustering, we reduce the number of trainable parameters to just 3% compared to CLIP [1] backbone training while maintaining constant time and space complexity during inference. Furthermore, our alignment method connects embedding spaces of different modalities. During the alignment process, the conditional probabilities for a given object or phrase are estimated and aggregated, providing probabilistic support for our predictions. Hence, the alignment method is fully transparent. Experimental results on the MSR-VTT dataset demonstrate that the proposed VTA method offers state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, our alignment method does not demand fine-tuning of the pre-trained encoder, thereby avoiding bias from small paired training datasets."

Most existing tracking methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers emphasize integrating multi-modal features through cross-modal attention, but ignore the potential exploitability of complementary information learned by cross-modal attention for enhancing modal features. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical progressive fusion network based on cross-modal attention guided enhancement for RGB-T tracking. Specifically, the complementary information generated by cross-modal attention implicitly reflects the consistent regions of interest of important information between different modalities, which is used to enhance modal features in a targeted manner. In addition, a modal feature refinement module and a fusion module are designed based on dynamic routing to perform noise suppression and adaptive integration on the enhanced multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on GTOT, RGBT234, LasHeR and VTUAV show that our method has competitive performance compared with recent state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Serverless computing has emerged as a novel paradigm in cloud computing, characterized by its agile scalability, cost-effective pay-as-you-go billing, and user-friendly capabilities for Machine Learning (ML) inference tasks. Developers wrap their ML algorithms into serverless functions and run them in containers. However, the well-known cold-start problem significantly slows down the response time of functions. To address cold-starts, the technique of pre-warming, which proactively maintains containers in a warm state, has gained widespread adoption across both research and industry. Nevertheless, we observed that pre-warming does not address the distinct delays caused by the loading of ML artifacts. According to our analysis, in ML inference functions, the time required to load libraries and models significantly exceeds the time needed to warm containers. Thus, relying solely on pre-warming is insufficient for mitigating cold-starts.

Creating a dependable protection system for an AC microgrid is challenging due to numerous practical considerations. In this work, several protection devices (PDs) in AC microgrids are systematically analyzed, with a focus on systems that employ electronically connected Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). This work employed several mathematical modeling equations to illustrate the challenges in microgrid protection associated with various operating modes. This study emphasizes the move toward intelligent and adaptive PDs, which offer enhanced fault isolation, real-time load balancing, fault detection, and system resilience. This research also underlines the usefulness of artificial intelligence (AI) in reducing the negative consequences of cyberattacks and cybersecurity challenges, especially those that jeopardize data integrity and confidentiality in microgrid PDs. Through an examination of pertinent standards and regulations, this paper explores how sophisticated communication and measurement methods might facilitate adaptive microgrid PDs that can update and modify relay settings automatically. The paper ends with several recommendations, highlighting the necessity of stronger cybersecurity measures and more reliable PDs to guarantee that the microgrid keeps playing a vital part in the shift to low-carbon energy."

To address this limitation, we developed HYDRA-OL (HYDrodynamically filled Realistic Anatomy of the Occipital Lobe) phantoms using high-resolution 3D printing based on the BigBrain atlas. In this study, two phantom types were created, HYDRA-OLG (gray matter only) and HYDRA-OLGW (gray and white matter), enabling contrast modulation between gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM). Precise anatomical fidelity and repositioning accuracy were confirmed via CT. A custom closed-loop filling apparatus ensured efficient and reproducible phantom preparation. Residual air in the phantom after 15 minutes was estimated to be less than 0.01% of the fillable space. To compare spatial resolution between scanners, the HYDRA-OLG phantom was imaged on four different PET systems (NeuroEXPLORER (NX), HRRT, Vision, and Focus220), with NX and Focus showing superior spatial resolution compared to the other two systems. To generate variable GM:WM contrast, list mode datasets obtained on the NX for both HYDRA-OLG and HYDRA-OLGW phantoms were down-sampled and merged to form one list mode data. Reconstructed images were successfully produced with GM:WM contrast ratio of 4:1, 2:1, and 4:3. Overall, the HYDRA phantom platform is a versatile tool for accurately representing human brain anatomy. It is likely to be more useful than previous phantoms for evaluating image resolution and optimizing reconstruction parameters for next-generation brain PET systems."

We evaluated the performance of the method on the quadratic assignment problem and compared it with two baselines: one that randomly reduces variables and another that directly solves the original QUBO without any variable reduction. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that the proposed method achieves high-accuracy solutions within the same computation time, particularly for large problem sizes."

    "abstract": "Multispectral LiDAR point clouds are valuable in remote sensing for their spatial-spectral consistency, yet their high acquisition and annotation costs pose significant challenges. To mitigate this, self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising solution, reducing reliance on annotated data while improving model generalization. However, existing self-supervised frameworks for point clouds often overlook the complexity of ground object distribution in large-scale remote sensing scenarios and fail to leverage the spectral information inherent in multispectral point clouds. In this paper, we introduce the Self-Supervised Spatial-Spectral Distance Reconstruction Network (S4DR-Net), a novel self-supervised pre-training network designed for multispectral point cloud classification. Serving as the key component of the network, the Spatial-Spectral Distance Prediction module (S-SDP) effectively addresses these limitations by reconstructing the distance relationships between voxel blocks in three-dimensional Euclidean as well as spectral spaces. By jointly considering spatial and spectral distances, S-SDP enables the network to learn a unified representation that captures the intrinsic spatial-spectral consistency of multispectral point clouds. This design allows S4DR-Net to generate low-dimensional feature representations in a self-supervised manner, without reliance on manual annotations. We conducted experiments and evaluated on two real-world multispectral point cloud datasets. The results demonstrate that S4DR-Net consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pre-training methods, achieving superior accuracy and generalization compared with current state-of-the-art approaches.

By establishing an inertial sensor noise hard-truncation mechanism and a global historical state reverse-correction model, we propose a multi-step kinematic constraint framework based on state correlation, which enhances the consistency between sensor heterogeneous characteristics and the positioning model, suppresses the long-term impact of PDR cumulative errors on positioning, and reduces the interference of abnormal GNSS observations on system states.Simulation and field experiments show that the proposed scheme can effectively fuse low-cost smartphone sensor data in complex environments including urban canyons and signal-occluded areas, achieving highly robust integrated navigation and providing theoretical support for seamless positioning in dynamic interference scenarios."

    "abstract": "With the increasing application of environmentally friendly E-coating systems, water-based paints are being widely used. However, lower process temperatures and water recirculation promote microbial growth, leading to contamination in processing tanks and rinse water systems. Traditional disinfectants, such as biocides, face regulatory restrictions and risk bacterial resistance, necessitating alternative solutions. Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) treatment, which permeabilizes bacterial cell membranes through high electric field strengths, represents a sustainable method for microbial control in E-coating systems. However, paint deposition on electrodes and paint coagulation must be prevented during PEF treatment to maintain coating quality and system functionality. Calculations showed that this can be achieved using pulses in the range of few ns, while longer pulses promote paint deposition on electrodes. Electrodeposition on metallic substrates occurs through water electrolysis, where a pH increase at the cathode causes coating particles to become water-insoluble, leading to their attachment. Reducing the pulse duration below the induction time for OH<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-</sup> formation was ineffective, as even short pulses <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(&lt;1 \\mu \\mathrm{s})$</tex> could not completely prevent deposition. High pulse repetition rates further promoted coating formation by continuously increasing pH levels. A more effective approach involved using bipolar pulses, where alternating anodic and cathodic interfaces neutralized OH<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-</sup> and H<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">+</sup> ions.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel truncated conical hollow cathode (HC) for plasma discharge-driven electron beam sources, addressing the limitations of traditional hollow cathodes in single-gap configurations. The plasma-discharge in conventional HCs with inner cylindrical geometry results in single HCP when used in single-gap configuration. However, for the generation of high-energy electron beams using plasma-assisted electron beam sources, multiple HCPs with a HC capable sustaining the high-voltage breakdown for longer duration is desirable. The conventional multigap configurations introduce significant challenges in terms of design, fabrication, and integration, especially when dealing with millimeter-scale apertures. In this work, we present a HC with truncated conical inner geometry to mitigate these challenges and enable the formation of multiple HCPs in a single-gap configuration. This novel cathode design enhances the plasma discharge breakdown time and facilitates the generation of a high-energy electron beam in a single-gap configuration itself. It is a cold cathode, designed to generate cylindrical electron beam and utilizes a plasma-assisted Pseudo-spark (PS) discharge mechanism. Its geometry comprises a hollow cathode cavity with a truncated cone combined with a cylindrical extension. The apex of the cone is truncated at the front wall containing a single HC aperture, while the base of the cone extends into a cylindrical shape, matching the diameter of the conical base. The entire hollow cavity is enclosed by a solid metallic cylinder, with a diameter slightly larger diameter than that of the conical base. This ensures the external geometry remains consistent with conventional cylindrical hollow cathodes. A 3D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation study of the proposed truncated conical HC was carried out using the software VSim Multiphysics. The truncated conical HC represents a significant advancement in PS discharge-driven electron beam technology, offering a simpler and more efficient approach to generating high-energy beams with multiple HCPs in a single-gap configuration."

However, current theoretical research is disconnected from engineering practice, lacking verification in actual hardware systems. The paper first jointly designs radar waveforms and filters based on optimization theory to achieve range sidelobe suppression. Then, it constructs an arbitrary radar waveform transmitting/receiving platform using FPGA and high-speed AD modules, which can generate arbitrary waveforms, radiate them into space, receive target echo signals in an outdoor environment, and transmit them back to the host computer, thereby realizing real data verification of the waveform optimization algorithm. Corner reflectors are deployed as the targets to be measured in the real environment. The experimental results show that: each module of the hardware system functions as expected, with high accuracy in generating optimized waveforms and collecting signals; under the same bandwidth condition, the optimized waveforms have lower sidelobes compared to linear frequency modulation signals."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of the Low-Altitude Economy (LAE) drives widespread deployment of multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems for latency-sensitive applications. Collaborative task offloading to edge servers addresses computational limitations but exposes sensitive operational patterns to adversaries. Existing offloading strategies primarily optimize performance metrics such as latency and energy consumption while overlooking critical privacy concerns. To address this gap, we propose GDP-UAV, a novel privacy-preserving offloading framework based on differential privacy. Unlike traditional approaches, GDP-UAV mechanism injects dynamically calibrated Gaussian noise into both action selection and policy updates during offloading, effectively obfuscating decision patterns while maintaining learning stability. Specifically, we first formulate a privacy-constrained optimization problem to minimize noise-perturbed computational costs. Moreover, we establish formal differential privacy guarantees through bounded strategy sensitivity with detailed proven convergence and privacy under persistent noise. Extensive simulations validate the framework, demonstrating 11.6% lower privacy leakage and under 13.2% task completion overhead compared to non-private baselines across LAE scenarios."

    "abstract": "Stream processing systems are typically long-running and likely experience varying workloads over time. The systems may need to process an excessive amount of data at any time. They must scale their capacity to meet low-latency requirements while still being resource-efficient. In distributed stream processing systems (DSPSs), scaling typically involves reconfiguring the physical topology of streaming jobs in the distributed computing environment. Current production-level DSPSs adopt a shared-nothing architecture to achieve scalability and reliability at a low cost, though this makes scaling stateful processing challenging. Most DSPSs employ a fixed partitioning scheme, which prevents altering the topology at runtime. As a result, scaling is performed by releasing the jobs and redeploying them with a modified topology. In fact, rescaling only some operators is sufficient to handle changes in workload. Several studies propose on-the-fly scaling by exchanging states between parallel instances of an operator. However, their custom state transfer mechanisms require substantial modifications to the existing DSPS architecture. We propose a dynamic scaling scheme that allows individual operators to scale at runtime with respect to the standard mechanisms provided by current DSPSs. We employ just-in-time snapshots for efficient state management of stateful processing. Compared to the job redeployment, the implemented approach in Apache Flink shows that scaling can be performed faster, with up to 80 percent for scale-out and two orders of magnitude for scale-in. The dynamic scaling scheme maintains stable performance during the rescaling phase."

However, no models have yet been developed to describe the randomness-filled motions of biorobots, and their unique biological properties are also underutilized. In this work, the locomotion responses of a biorobot to electrical stimuli were summarized. The constant-current signal was found to have a higher capacity for sustained stimuli than existing methods. The joint influence of wall and current factors on cockroach behavior was explored to establish an environment-adaptive control model describing their locomotion. This model was then used to propose an navigation method enhanced by the inherent nature of a biorobot. In an indoor scenario, the proposed method achieved a success rate of 78.6% with minimal runtime and stimulus number while the control group using conventional navigation methods achieved a success rate of 30%, with two or three times the runtime and stimulus number. Compared with other approaches, the proposed method facilitates high-precision and long-range navigation with a short navigation time and very low control costs."

    "abstract": "Semantically bridging known and novel domains, Zero-Shot Fault Diagnosis (ZSFD) often faces two main challenges. First, deterministic semantic-fault associations fail to capture generalization. Second, automatically generated semantics are flat and redundant, impairing diagnostic inference. To address these issues, a Probabilistic Semantic Compression framework is proposed for ZSFD in this work. The approach extracts discriminative features through a contrastive projection head and constructs probabilistic semantics via a semantic projection head. The probabilistic semantics capture the uncertainty during the dynamic evolution of nonstationary fault patterns, replacing hard categorical assignments. A semantic compression module adaptively compresses the flat and redundant probabilistic semantics in a structure with both high interclass discriminability and interclass correlation. Features and semantics are mutually embedded in a shared latent space, where they are aligned based on their probabilistic distributions to enable the detection of novel faults. Extensive validation on three industrial datasets demonstrates strong generalization and effective transfer from bearings with artificially induced damage to those with naturally occurring faults."

Traditional spatial interpolation methods, however, often fall short of producing reliable interpolation results due to the limited and irregular sensor coverage. This paper introduces a novel spatial interpolation pipeline that achieves reliable interpolation results and produces a novel heatmap representation with uncertainty information encoded. We leverage imputation reference data from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance visualization reliability and temporal resolution. By integrating Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA) and Geographical Positional Encoding (GPE), our model effectively learns the spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose an extrinsic, static visualization technique for interpolation-based heatmaps that effectively communicates the uncertainties arising from various sources in the interpolated map. Through a set of use cases, extensive evaluations on real-world datasets, and user studies, we demonstrate our model's superior performance for data imputation, the improvements to the interpolant with reference data, and the effectiveness of our visualization design in communicating uncertainties."

Moreover, its frequency bandwidth exceeds several gigahertz and its measurement dynamics allows measurement from less than 1 V/m up to the breakdown field. All these properties make the EO probe suitable for real time characterization of discharges."

To enhance NBI performance, development efforts focus on optimizing radio-frequency (RF) inductively coupled plasma (ICP) positive ion sources to achieve high-density positive hydrogen ion beams. In RF ICP sources, this optimization involves balancing ion production and transport mechanisms. In a production-limited regime, ion flux is primarily constrained by ionization and dissociation rates; increasing RF power or improving electron heating directly enhances ion flux. Conversely, in a transport-limited regime, the efficiency of transport mechanisms, such as diffusion and convection, restricts ion flux. While increasing RF power still contributes to additional ion production, the transport bottleneck limits how much of that production translates into higher flux. Understanding the transition between these regimes is crucial for optimization."

First, the electrothermal instability leads to non-uniform current concentration perpendicular to the direction of flow and thus degraded switch performance. Second, dielectric tamping is commonly used to control switch operation. Different materials are investigated. Resolved calculations of inhomogeneous granular tamper materials are shown."

    "abstract": "Failures of safety-critical systems such as highly automated cars may result in loss of life, significant property damage, or environmental harm. Their trustworthiness and acceptance by society relies on safe operation, i.e., they have to be safer than their human-controlled counterparts, which is called the positive risk balance and which is a prerequisite for the operation in the EU. Hence, guaranteeing sufficient safety is a crucial task that requires rigorous examination. However, critical events such as severe accidents are assumed to occur with probabilities of order 10-6 or less. For this, automated simulation-based approaches for the purpose of statistical model checking contribute significantly to quantitative safety assessment. Common methods such as pure Monte Carlo simulation are inadequate to estimate the probability of these rare critical events due to excessively high simulation budget required. To overcome this, we provide a mathematical framework for combining an optimization algorithm, here from the family of optimistic optimization algorithms, with importance sampling in order to assess the safety of these systems quantitatively. Our methodology relies on a given criticality function that assesses each state of the underlying deterministic system regarding prescribed safety requirements. Applying the approach to a common test function and a simulated braking scenario using the software SILAB showcases that our method significantly reduces the required effort to quantify acceptable risk levels, compared to pure Monte Carlo simulation."

However, desired signals of a low-velocity impact are easily overwhelmed by a strong noise in a 1-D time-domain with sparse sensor networks, reducing localization accuracy. To address this problem, a DenseNet-convolutional block attention module (CBAM) model is proposed based on image regression to realize high-precision impact localization on composite lamination structures. To reduce the interference of baseline drift and high-frequency noise components, the collected signals are reconstructed by a discrete wavelet. To highlight all the signal features in both the time and frequency domains, the reconstructed signals are transformed into a database of time-frequency spectrograms by using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and image augmentation methods. A 650 × 650 × 3 mm composite lamination structure is designed to validate the efficiency of our suggested method. The experiment results demonstrate that the model exhibits excellent global performance when CBAM focuses on spectrograms before the Dense-Block process. The maximum localization errors are 12.813mm for the DenseNet-CBAM model, 26.926mm for the traditional statistical method, and 13.963mm for ResNet-CBAM. The mean localization errors are 6.419mm for the DenseNet-CBAM model, 12.041mm for the traditional statistical method, and 7.873mm for ResNet-CBAM. In all, our suggested DenseNet-CBAM method is superior to traditional statistical methods and general deep learning methods."

The drive system utilizes a long stator linear motor, and the vehicle is equipped with permanent magnets. Due to the possible high distance between the inverter and stator, the power circuit contains an LC filter. Therefore, the current controller must deal with a three-phase inductive–capacitive–inductive (LCL) circuit. Moreover, the stator of the machine is divided into segments. This leads to relatively fast changes in the induced voltage when the vehicle is passing through segment boundaries. Therefore, the current controller must deal with fast-changing disturbances. The state feedback control with gains selected using the linear-quadratic regulator approach is used to achieve high-quality system performance. Design and implementation include retuning of the controller gains for variable synchronous frequency. The control system is designed in the discrete domain concerning signal processing delay. The current control system with optimal gains is applied on the digital signal controller and verified experimentally on the test track."

This active zero-bit watermark embeds a compact neural identity signature directly within a facial image and later reconstructs the pre-swap appearance from a single image. The scheme employs a pair of symmetric, attention-enhanced U-Nets acting as an embedder and extractor. It is trained with a specific training pipeline that mixes five different face-swap engines with classical degradations such as noise and blur. This diversity forces the network to learn robust, high-level cues rather than brittle artifact patterns, yielding transparent watermarks that remain visually imperceptible at a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of approximately 36 dB. Unlike previous active defenses that only flag manipulations, RE-Mark hides enough semantic redundancy to recover an authentic face without any external reference gallery, closing the gap between fragile detectors and robust—but non-restorative—watermarks. Therefore, the method equips platforms and investigators with a practical tool for both tamper verification and post‑factum identity restoration."

We propose a CP-aware waveform design that generates the OOK signal over the entire CP-OFDM symbol duration, potentially breaking subcarrier orthogonality after passing through the channel if the CP is not matched. To enable such a mechanism, OOK has to be generated independently and a modification to the existing OFDM-based OOK generation block is needed. Additionally, a block-wise time shift can be applied to minimize CP mismatch. Analytical discussions and simulations confirm that the resulting interference on legacy subcarriers remains controlled, while OOK detection performance significantly improves, albeit with tradeoffs that should be carefully considered in practical deployments."

However, wireless communication introduces new challenges, including susceptibility to noise, electromagnetic interference, and data loss, which can compromise battery state estimation accuracy. Robust algorithmic methods are thus essential for ensuring reliability and functional safety. In this paper, we first present data transmission analysis in an experimental wBMS setup developed in the European project HELIOS. Second, we propose a robust parameter estimation algorithm that identifies battery model parameters and noise characteristics. Lastly, we develop a noise-tolerant Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter (AEKF) for state-of-charge estimation. The AEKF is optimized using a genetic algorithm and incorporates a Bernoulli-based packet loss detector with an online-identified model to reconstruct missing data. The proposed methods are validated using experimental data under varying noise and packet loss scenarios. Results show estimation errors under 1% at 30 dB SNR and a twofold reduction in estimation drift over 20 driving cycles. Real-time feasibility is demonstrated on a BMS, with reported metrics on memory and computation overhead."

    "abstract": "X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) is a powerful diagnostic technique for warm dense matter as it directly probes the dynamic structure factor (DSF) of a system. However, the measured spectrum is broadened by the source and instrument function (SIF) of the experiment, which needs to be removed in order to extract useful information. Since direct deconvolution is unstable to experimental noise and finite spectral ranges, the de-facto approach to interpreting XRTS spectra is to fit a model to the data, which includes the SIF broadening. However, this means the inferred conditions depend on the model used. More recently, it has been demonstrated that direct deconvolution can be performed by first performing a two-sided Laplace transform on the XRTS spectrum and SIF, and then dividing the two quantities [Dornheim et al., Nat. Comm. 137911 (2022)]. The resulting quantity - the imaginary time correlation function (ITCF) - is the two-sided Laplace transform of the DSF, which contains identical information to the DSF but in an unfamiliar form. For example, the temperature of the system is given directly by the minimum point of the ITCF, meaning this method in principle gives direct access to the system temperature. However, the SIF is challenging to accurately measure, and model forms of the SIF are often used instead, which reintroduces model-dependency in the inferred conditions. Here, we investigate an approach to avoid needing to measure or model the SIF entirely: Using the deconvolution theorem in the Laplace domain, we take the ratio of two Laplace transformed spectra. Provided the two SIFs are sufficiently similar, the SIF terms cancel, and the temperature can again be directly inferred from the minimum point of the raito. We use ray tracing simulations to validate the principle of the approach, and investigate its robustness to SIFs that do not exactly match."

    "abstract": "In an emerging type of particle accelerator, the laser wakefield accelerator, an intense laser pulse separates the charges by pushing electrons aside creating a wake, similar to that behind a boat on water; the plasma electrons re-converge a short distance behind the laser pulse [1]. Co-moving electrons can ‘surf’ this wake and be accelerated by its strong electric field. The achievable energy and other properties of the accelerated electron bunch depend on the amplitude of the laser pulse and its persistence. Laser wakefield accelerators (LWFAs) use the high-field resilience of plasmas to accelerate electrons to high energies in a compact space. Improving the properties of the resulting electron bunches requires stable acceleration over long lengths. We show, using particle-in-cell simulations, that a stable accelerating structure can be achieved using a pre-pulse to increase the electron density for the main pulse, which forms a co-moving deep plasma channel guiding it over a cm. Stable wakefields are also necessary for ion channel lasers to avoid longitudinal acceleration. The system is an interesting example of non-linear interaction between two laser pulses through the plasma. The prepared phase-space distribution of electrons has been analyzed for wakefield stability and further guiding of the laser pulse [2]."

The optimal combination of the structural factors of the electromagnetic loading device is obtained through optimization and selection analysis, and the system efficiency and influencing factors of the electromagnetic loading device are studied based on the coupled finite element analysis of the optimal solution."

    "abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a powerful tool for capturing the discrete particle effects involved in electron emission and propagation. They have proven effective in studying how electron emission from microstructures influences beam characteristics, including emittance, current density, and brightness [1], [2]. However, the high computational cost of MD simulations remains a significant challenge. The MD code, RUMDEED, incorporates the image-charge method to evaluate the electric field modified by space-charge effects near the cathode surface. This can be done in an exact manner for specific geometries. By using simplified parametric calculations, the image-charge model can be applied to a broader range of emitter shapes, reducing the computational load while maintaining accuracy in capturing key physical effects. We use machine learning to enable faster and approximate predictions of the electric field near a nonplanar emitter surface. Results for different geometries of CNT-fiber emitters will be presented."

    "abstract": "Highly-informed Expressive Performance Rendering (EPR) systems transform music scores with rich musical annotations into human-like expressive performance MIDI files. While these systems have achieved promising Results, the availability of detailed music scores is limited compared to MIDI files and are less flexible to work with using a digital audio workstation (DAW). Recent advancements in low-informed EPR systems offer a more accessible alternative by directly utilizing scorederived MIDI as input, but these systems often exhibit suboptimal performance. Meanwhile, existing works are evaluated with diverse automatic metrics and data formats, hindering direct objective comparisons between EPR systems. In this study, we introduce Peransformer, a transformer-based low-informed EPR system designed to bridge the gap between low-informed and highly-informed EPR systems. Our approach incorporates a score-aware discriminator that leverages the underlying scorederived MIDI files and is trained on a score-to-performance paired, note-to-note aligned MIDI dataset. Experimental Results demonstrate that Peransformer achieves state-of-the-art performance among low-informed systems, as validated by subjective evaluations. Furthermore, we extend existing automatic evaluation metrics for EPR systems and introduce generalized EPR metrics (GEM), enabling more direct, accurate, and reliable comparisons across EPR systems.

    "abstract": "In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks. However, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning scenarios, such as ambiguous inference paths and frequent hallucinations, which hinder their adoption in high-stakes domains like medicine, law, and education. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel unified framework that integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enhance the reasoning ability and factual consistency of LLMs. The framework is designed around two core objectives: reasoning enhancement and hallucination mitigation, and adopts a three-layer architecture to achieve these goals. Each layer is designed to interact through a structured semantic path, providing controllable reasoning guidance and factual grounding. Compared to traditional approaches like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the proposed method introduces explicit control over reasoning chains, thereby enhancing interpretability and output fidelity. This paper further analyzes current limitations in generalizability and engineering deployment, and identifies potential directions for future research, such as multimodal knowledge integration and prototype system development. The proposed framework offers a novel perspective on constructing trustworthy and controllable LLM-based systems, paving the way for their broader application in critical domains."

Although assembly language is more interpretable for humans, it requires more complex models to capture token-level context. In contrast, machine code may enable more efficient, lightweight models and preserve all information that might be lost in disassembly. This paper approaches the task of vulnerability detection through an exploratory study on two specific deep learning model architectures and aims to systematically evaluate their performance across three vulnerability types. The results demonstrate that graph-based models consistently outperform sequential models, emphasizing the importance of control flow relationships, and that machine code contains sufficient information for effective vulnerability discovery."

    "abstract": "The global population aged 65 and older is expected to more than double—from 700 million in 2020 to approximately 1.5 billion by 2050. In response to this demographic shift, the silver industry is rapidly expanding. However, this growing market must also evolve its perception of older adults—seeing them not merely as dependent elderly individuals, but as young-at-heart, active consumers with diverse needs and preferences. Among the technologies most prominently integrated into the senior industry, artificial intelligence (AI) plays a central role in shaping modern marketing strategies. AI-based tools such as voice recognition systems and the Internet of Things (IoT) are increasingly being used to support seniors’ health, mobility, and everyday convenience. In particular, AI enhances the senior consumer experience in distribution and digital platforms, enabling greater comfort, autonomy, and access to a premium lifestyle. The growth of the silver industry and the advancement of AI-driven marketing are closely intertwined. As such, it is critical to develop strategic approaches for effectively applying AI marketing techniques to meet the evolving needs of the senior demographic. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the cognitive and behavioral characteristics of senior consumers, review the current status of senior-related industries across countries, and propose an innovative AI marketing model tailored to the transforming senior market."

The system then generates a concise story, supported by visuals and straightforward explanations. A proof of concept (POC) using Sentinel-5P data demonstrates how this approach can track pollutant levels in France's Centre-Val de Loire region. The POC shows how a data-storytelling-inspired swarm-agent architecture can make EO insights accessible, intelligible, and transparent to a broad audience in under 10seconds."

Specifically, we built an emoji library based on the SAMSum dataset and established a mapping relationship between the emoji dataset and dialogues to better preserve the emotional information conveyed in online dialogue emojis. Moreover, we propose an emotion-aware mechanism that captures various emotional categories in emojis and dialogues to generate weak supervision signals, enhancing the model's ability to focus on the crucial emotional context within dialogues and thereby improving the relevance and precision of dialogue summarization. The experimental results on the SAMSum dataset show that EMOSum achieves improved performance, enhancing the emotional expressiveness of dialogue summaries."

Personality detection based on user-generated text is a method with broad application prospects, such as for constructing user portraits. The presence of significant noise in social media texts hinders personality detection. However, previous studies have not delved deeper into addressing this challenge. Inspired by the scanning reading technique, we propose an attention-based information extraction mechanism (AIEM) for long texts, which is applied to quickly locate valuable pieces of text, and fully integrate beneficial semantic information. Then, we provide a novel attention-based denoising framework (ADF) for personality detection tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance on two commonly used datasets. Notably, we obtain an average accuracy improvement of 10.2% on the gold standard Twitter-Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (Twitter-MBTI) dataset.

    "abstract": "Due to the complex distribution, class imbalance and limited diversity of network data, existing intrusion detection schemes still face significant performance bottlenecks in fine-grained classification tasks. To address this issue, we propose a multi-parallel intrusion detection framework with Group-Based Data Augmentation (GDA). This framework constructs a heterogeneous detection model ensemble by implementing an adaptive grouping, which partitions similar data into clusters to capture the intricate distribution patterns of network behaviors. This framework establishes a one-to-one mapping between data groups and their dedicated detection models through a grouping-model binding mechanism, forming multi-parallel detection units. Each detection model utilizes Ensemble Autoencoders (Em-AE) for interpretable data augmentation, employs contrastive learning to optimize intra-class and inter-class sample distances, and utilizes a simple classifier for fine-grained classification. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets CIC-IDS-2017 (15-class), CIC-IoT-2023 (29-class), and CIC-IoMT-2024 (19-class) demonstrate that GDA achieves fine-grained classification accuracies of 95.57 %, 96.64 %, and 99.99 %, respectively.

Trained and evaluated on dedicated spatial-reasoning benchmarks, our depth-enhanced architecture yields substantial accuracy gains over an RGB-only baseline and produces more human-like judgments of relative position and distance. These findings chart a clear path from 2-D image-language models toward true 3-D spatial understanding. Crucially, the compact design retains the rich semantics learned during CLIP’S large-scale pre-training, enabling markedly faster convergence while matching the final accuracy achieved by training from scratch."

    "abstract": "This paper studies an important problem of scheduling user-submitted computation tasks in cloud brokerage environments, where task execution times exhibit stochastic uncertainty. Existing scheduling approaches typically assume deterministic task durations, leading to resource over-provisioning or service level agreement (SLA) violations under the impact of task duration variations. To bridge this gap, we formulate an uncertainty-aware scheduling model that minimizes the total monetary cost incurred by the cloud broker considering the penalties for overdue tasks and probabilistic success rate threshold. We introduce the concept of success rate (SR) to represent the fraction of successfully completed tasks, and further impose a lower-bound probability that the scheduling solution satisfies the SR specified in the SLA with varying task execution times. We further propose an improved estimation of distribution algorithm (IEDA), which is a population-based metaheuristic, to solve the resultant stochastic optimization problem. IEDA starts with an improved initialization strategy to generate a population of high-quality initial solutions. Then, IEDA incorporates an efficient sampling strategy that relies on an elite population and a probability sequence to evolve the population. To evaluate the quality of each candidate solution, we employ a greedy-based strategy to map each task to an appropriate computing resource under SLA constraints. Extensive experiments on an Amazon EC2-based cloud platform demonstrate the promising effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed IEDA in solving the uncertainty-affected scheduling problem."

    "abstract": "Burst flows in network traffic, are characterized by a sudden increase followed by a sudden decrease in packet frequency over a short period. Their instantaneous high-frequency characteristic easily induces network congestion, performance degradation, and potential cyberspace security risks. Therefore, it is necessary to accurately and promptly detect burst flows for various applications such as intrusion detection, traffic engineering, and network management. However, current work on burst-flow detection faces the issues of low precision and high memory overhead. To address these issues, this paper proposes an accurate low-overhead detection algorithm for burst flows in network traffic called BurstDetector. In the BurstDetector, we first design a low-overhead small-flow filter based on probabilistic data structures, to identify potential burst flows and filter out small flows. Then, we design burst-flow detection table to find out real burst flows and report their information including flow IDs and bursty periods. In particular, we propose a probabilistic replacement strategy based on bursty periods and flow frequencies to accommodate potential burst flows, for precise detection of burst flows. Finally, we theoretically derive the false positive error rate of the small-flow filter and the error bound of the burst-flow detection table in our proposed BurstDetector and conduct experimental evaluations on its performance with real network traffic traces. Experimental results indicate that the BurstDetector achieves the precision of over 95 %, the recall rate of more than 94 %, and the throughput of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{2 7. 8 1} \\text{Mips}$</tex>, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms."

    "abstract": "The outcome of text recognition for degraded color documents is often unsatisfactory due to interference from various contaminants. To extract information more efficiently for text recognition, document image enhancement and binarization are often employed as preliminary steps in document analysis. Training independent generative adversarial networks (GANs) for each color channel can generate images where shadows and noise are effectively removed, which subsequently allows for efficient text information extraction. However, employing multiple GANs for different color channels requires long training and inference times. To reduce both the training and inference times of these preliminary steps, we propose an efficient method based on multi-scale feature extraction, which incorporates Haar wavelet transformation and normalization to process document images before submitting them to GANs for training. Experiment results show that our proposed method significantly reduces both the training and inference times while maintaining comparable performances when benchmarked against the state-of-the-art methods. In the best case scenario, a reduction of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 0 \\%}$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2 6 \\%}$</tex> are observed for training and inference times, respectively, while maintaining the model performance at 73.79 of Average-Score metric.

With cutting-edge deep learning (DL) technologies, in the form of the powerful Transformer frameworks, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is now possible to capture user behavior, context, and preferences in a never-before-seen level of accuracy. Such models are more than conventional collaborative filtering with incorporation of real-time user interaction, semantics content interpretation, and multi-modal data integration. An outstanding instrument in this field is Amazon SageMaker, that enables the scope of scalable DL-driven recommendation engines by propelling model preparation, maximization and impression. By using them in conjunction with cognitive computing, it is possible to do adaptive learning, natural language understanding and emotion-aware personalization, essentially transforming user engagement and purchase intent in e-commerce platforms."

Artificial intelligence technology provides new ideas for equipment maintenance design verification, but its accuracy and reliability in specific knowledge fields still need to be improved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a maintenance design verification based on Retrieval Enhanced Generative Technology (RAG). By constructing a professional domain knowledge base and utilizing the powerful generation function of Large Language Model (LLM), RAG is extended to access specific domain knowledge bases or authoritative knowledge bases, thereby improving the accuracy of retrieval in specific knowledge domains. Equipment maintenance design verification based on RAG can not only conduct a “census” of complex equipment, but also avoid manual verification omissions caused by time and experience limitations, effectively improving the quality and efficiency of maintenance verification."

    "abstract": "The sequential recommendation, aimed at predicting the next item in a user's session based on historical interactions, is crucial for enhancing personalized recommendation systems. Existing neural network-based methods, such as recurrent and self-attentive architectures, predominantly focus on modeling user-centric sequential patterns, often overlooking item temporal dynamics and high-order connectivity between users and items. These limitations hinder their ability to effectively capture the intricate relationships that drive user behavior. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel model. This model leverages a bipartite graph structure to encode both user-item interactions and high-order connectivity, integrating temporal, positional, and intent information. Using a position-augmented temporal graph convolution in combination with a self-attention-based aggregator, the method concurrently derives time-varying embeddings for users and items, which improves the capture of sequence dependencies and collaborative cues. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model against state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a better balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, thereby making it highly applicable to real-time recommendation scenarios."

Yet despite this progress, one fundamental issue continues to hinder advancement: how we evaluate these systems. Many of today’s APR benchmarks suffer from serious limitations—including small dataset sizes, synthetic or unrealistic bug scenarios, overfitting risks, ambiguous evaluation criteria, and a narrow focus on certain programming languages.In this paper, we take a critical look at these challenges by identifying eight core limitations in widely used benchmarks. We then explore how LLM-generated benchmarks can help overcome these obstacles. Finally, we address some potential concerns about LLM-generated benchmarks and propose a quality assurance and validation framework.By combining the strengths of LLMs with thoughtful benchmark design, this work lays the foundation for more robust, diverse, and meaningful evaluation frameworks—paving the way for future breakthroughs in APR research."

    "abstract": "Future particle colliders rely on high current positron sources to meet the demands on collision events per time. As the positrons beams are highly divergent after their generation inside of solid targets, their low-loss delivery to the experiment is highly dependent on a so-called optical matching device at the positron source, which focuses the particles into the downstream accelerator sections. For the positron source of the International Linear Collider (ILC), an active plasma lens has been proposed as optical matching device. Such plasma lenses, where a current is driven through a discharge plasma to produce a symmetric focusing force for the positrons moving collinear with the plasma current, can provide focusing forces superior to conventional focusing devices. The prototype of an active plasma lens for positron focusing was developed and tested in a collaboration between the University of Hamburg and DESY. Initial experiments revealed plasma instabilities and substantial copper sputtering from the discharge electrodes. This contribution will discuss results of longevity tests conducted across different pressure ranges and electrode materials."

Recalling that the lognormal model for the amplitude of shadow fading is physically based on obstacles in the radio transmission path and the central limit theorem for sums of random variables, a novel model for the phase distribution is proposed. The phase distribution model is based on a limit theorem for modulo sums of random variables. A persistence property of the uniform distribution in finite modulo sums is discussed."

    "abstract": "Securing wireless communication in heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) remains a critical challenge due to the diversity of node capabilities and constrained resources. This paper introduces an Optimized Key Distribution Protocol (OKDP) designed to ensure secure, energy-efficient, and scalable data transmission in such heterogeneous environments. The methodology integrates node classification into high-capacity cluster heads and low-power sensing nodes, followed by identity-based lightweight authentication. A Firefly Optimization Algorithm is used over a matrix-based key pre-distribution approach, with minimum memory overhead and maximum key-sharing likelihood. Forward and backward secrecy is achieved by use of dynamic key establishment through elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) and hash-based rekeying. The protocol is also reinforced by the fact that a trust-aware intrusion detection module is in place isolating compromise nodes in real time. The proposed OKDP achieved an average key sharing probability of 94.18%, compromised node tolerance of 85.26%, energy consumption of 1.45 J, and an operational accuracy of 96.42% across various simulation scenarios. Its significantly higher performance in resilience, energy consumption, and communication overhead are confirmed by comparative results against well-known benchmark protocols (LEAP+, ECC-KPS, SPINS, etc.). The privacy-sensitive characteristics of the privacy-preserving data aggregation are secured through the adoption of the homomorphic encryption, which does not hinder the computational tractability. OKDP architecture is highly scalable and flexible and could therefore be well suited to the IoT present-day use cases such as smart farming, combat surveillance, and medical supervision. This paper, therefore, proposes a secure and effective protocol that is lightweight, less CPU intensive and optimized to support real-time secure transmission of data in WSNs composed of heterogeneous nodes."

In recent years, methods based on contrastive learning and domain adaptation have shown promising performance in cross-domain TSAD tasks. However, these approaches primarily rely on timedomain features, which limits their effectiveness in identifying frequency-sensitive anomalies, such as periodic anomalies or abrupt frequency changes. To address this, this paper introduces a frequency domain enhancement module, based on ShortTime Fourier Transform (STFT), into a cross-domain detection framework. This module's output is then fused with the original time-domain representation to enhance the model's ability to capture complex patterns. We conducted extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MSL and SMD. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms both baseline and mainstream approaches in key indicators such as F1score, Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), thereby validating its robustness and effectiveness in complex scenarios."

The constructed dataset primarily consists of twospeaker dialogues but also includes many multi-party dialogues involving five or more participants. Additionally, it contains only a small amount of non-dialogue speech, making it suitable for the development of multi-party dialogue systems. Furthermore, since the dataset includes many relatively long dialogues, it is expected to be useful for long-duration dialogue applications."

    "abstract": "The emergence of applications such as online teaching and virtual laboratories in campus networks imposes extremely stringent requirements on network bandwidth, latency, and reliability. However, the congestion control algorithms widely adopted in current campus networks struggle to meet these demands. Campus network users are often concentrated, and their usage periods exhibit significant overlap. The greedy nature of TCP frequently leads to queue accumulation in buffers, resulting in frequent packet loss and retransmissions, which severely degrades the network experience. Given that modifying the protocol stack of terminal devices is often infeasible, this paper innovatively proposes an Adaptive Trend-Based Congestion Control (ATBCC) strategy. ATBCC performs congestion control at the access point router. It ingeniously adjusts the receive window field in the TCP header of ACK packets. This allows ATBCC to accurately calculate the target rate of each flow and proactively regulate the traffic rate in advance. Evaluations demonstrate that in wireless network scenarios, ATBCC significantly outperforms TCP CUBIC. Specifically, it shortens 95% of the queue length, reduces the average latency by 82.5%, and decreases the tail latency by 89.1%. In dynamic wireless link scenarios, ATBCC reduces the average latency and queue length by 40% and 60% respectively compared with Zhuge. ATBCC efficiently utilizes bandwidth while maintaining short queues, offering a novel solution for campus network congestion control."

Three coexistence strategies are introduced: (1) dual-PLMN integration via multi-operator core network (MOCN), (2) RAN slicing under a shared PLMN using distinct single network slice selection assistance information (S-NSSAI) values, and (3) inter-PLMN federation employing security edge protection proxy (SEPP) interfaces. Each architecture for military network incorporates zero trust principles and software defined perimeter (SDP) to ensure data plane isolation and session-based access control. Performance evaluation confirms that although SDP introduces throughput degradation, it is essential for enforcing military-grade security policies. The proposed models support flexible deployment scenarios such as dual-use base stations and joint operations paving the way for secure 5G adaptation in defense environments."

We developed a dynamic intention recognition system for elderly care, integrating visual data and conversational interactions. Building upon in-home fixed-point cameras and lightweight image recognition systems, facial, skeletal, and hand features were detected to monitor behavior changes. Image-based analysis alone is often insufficient to fully grasp the intentions behind observed actions. Therefore, we developed a multimodal system that combines (1) image-derived contextual cues and (2) dialogue with an interactive agent, analyzed through locally executable large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we utilized locally deployable models such as Meta-Llama and Llama 3.1 within a web-based interface built on AnythingLLM, enabling real-time conversational intention estimation without compromising data privacy. The developed system performs image-based context extraction, conversational prompting with embedded intentions, and time-windowed log analysis using local LLMs for chronological intention estimation and confirmation. Five participants were recruited to compare their self-reported intentions with those inferred by the system using document similarity metrics. The results demonstrated the feasibility of the system and its real-time, privacy-conscious performance in elderly home care.

    "abstract": "Intravascular therapy is a minimally invasive procedure that treats vascular abnormalities and requires accurate hemodynamic assessment to ensure effective treatment. Monitoring intravascular pressure within blood vessels provides insight into flow dynamics and pathological conditions. Current devices, including pressure-sensing guidewires, rely on embedded MEMS sensors near the tip, introducing electronic components into the body, while other interventional tools, such as stents, either remain passive or measure only non-hemodynamic parameters. To address these limitations, we developed a catheter-based pressure measurement system that enables direct pressure acquisition without flow disruption or internal embedding electronics, providing a more accurate hemodynamic assessment. The system employs a Pitot tube catheter integrated with MEMS-based sensors to evaluate pressure profiles in a 3D-printed vessel model with 30Calibration of both the pressure sensor and the peristaltic pump ensured reliable data acquisition throughout the operating range. The system successfully captured the pressure distribution along the vessel, including a significant pressure drop of approximately 420 Pa across the stenotic region and partial recovery downstream. These results validate the feasibility of Pitot-based catheter probes for in situ flow evaluation and demonstrate their potential for future applications in experimental and computational hemodynamics."

    "abstract": "Accurate and complete network traffic data is essential for effective network monitoring, anomaly detection, and performance optimization. However, in real-world scenarios, network measurements are often incomplete due to measurement overhead, equipment limitations, and complex topologies. To address this challenge, we propose Diff-BGC, a novel imputation framework based on diffusion models tailored for network traffic data. Diff-BGC transforms the traffic matrix at each time step into a bipartite graph structure and reformulates the imputation task as the estimation of unobserved edges. It leverages both static and dynamic node features, as well as topological information, to construct expressive edge embeddings. A conditional diffusion training strategy is introduced to guide the model in learning meaningful representations from partially observed data, enabling it to perform robust conditional generation through a reverse denoising process, We evaluate the proposed framework on real-world dataset GÉANT. Experimental results demonstrate that Diff-BGC outperforms several methods under varying sampling ratios, achieving lower normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE). Even when the sampling rate is only 2 %, the normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) generated by our method is only 0.67. The results confirm the effectiveness and adaptability of Diff-BGC in practical network traffic imputation tasks."

    "abstract": "Introduction: A hypnotherapy is a procedure which have evolved out of a Greek word hypnos (meaning sleep) and has come to be a valid complementary procedure used in anaesthesia of patients undergoing surgery to bring about a benefit in the reduction of peri-operative anxiety, managing pain in the post-operative stage and enhancing recovery. Hypnotherapy has also continued to be evolved through addition of machine learning and virtual reality (VR) into the hypnotherapy treatment plans and more personalization and scaling of clinical practice with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). Its clinics potential is old, as in the past, e.g. in 1829, Jules Cloquet conducted a mastectomy by hypnosis.Purpose: The systematic review will gauge the character of hypnotherapy, which is automated with AI technologies and applied to the surgical anaesthesia, particularly the adoption trends of the considered method in Malaysia and its application to other nations.Methodology: A very wide literature review was conducted in a number of peer-reviewed databases and the outcome of peri-operative anxiety, analgesic reduction, and recovery were analysed. The works, which proposed AI-enhanced approaches of delivery, such as virtual reality-generated hypnosis and monitoring of patient responses with the help of AI were also considered.Findings: The significant beneficial outcomes of hypnotherapy were demonstrated with the reduction of the level of anxiety, the reduction of the reliance on pharmacological analgesics, and the reduction of the recovery period. Hypnotherapeutic treatments on patients that were shown as potentially customized and standardized through AI-driven tools were predictive analytics of patient vulnerability and immersive VR hypnosis environment. However, there is the barrier of training in the form of infrastructural and cultural scepticism that prevents adoption- especially in Malaysia.Conclusion: Hypnotherapy using AI can result in colossal possibilities in improving the surgical anaesthesia practice. The additional training, development of AI-based protocols, and the improvement of the population awareness should be enlarged to synchronize the Malaysian healthcare policies with the improvements the world experiences in the digital and non-pharmacological anaesthetic care."

    "abstract": "In distributed network measurement systems, clients frequently establish multiple parallel Remote Procedure Call channels with remote nodes. Given the pronounced heterogeneity in link characteristics—such as bandwidth, round-trip time, and packet loss rate—dynamically scheduling data streams across these paths is essential for maintaining system performance and stability. To address this challenge, we propose a refined multipath scheduling algorithm that incorporates round-trip time, packet loss rate, and bandwidth into a unified, multidimensional path scoring mechanism. Leveraging this scoring framework, the algorithm adaptively selects the most suitable channel for each transmission in real time. To validate the algorithm's performance, we construct a three-path heterogeneous network and compare the proposed method with several established scheduling strategies, including Round-Robin, Random Path Scheduling, Weighted Round-Robin, and Delay-Aware Packet Scheduling. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm consistently delivers higher throughput under varying network conditions. Specifically, as the round-trip time of the primary path increases, the algorithm achieves a throughput improvement of 13.7% to 26.8% over Weighted Round-Robin. Similar gains are observed under elevated packet loss rates, underscoring the algorithm's enhanced adaptability, robustness, and overall effectiveness in heterogeneous environments."

    "abstract": "This study addresses the problem of active multi-object tracking in 3D environment, with a particular focus on application in 3D reconstruction. The objective is to achieve continuous tracking of multiple targets by dynamically controlling the poses of multiple cameras in real time. Unlike existing approaches, this work is conducted in a 3D environment populated with multiple cameras and targets, aiming to maximize the minimum 2-coverage (M2C) and the triangulation angle. Such multi-view coverage is crucial for enhancing the accuracy of 3D reconstruction. To this end, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that decomposes the task into a two-level policy structure. A highlevel coordinator assigns targets to low-level executors with the goal of optimizing the M2C and the triangulation angle, while each low-level executor is responsible for tracking its assigned targets by minimizing the relative angle to them. Experimental results in a custom-built 3D simulation environment demonstrate that the proposed method substantially improves coverage efficiency compared to baseline approaches."

Meanwhile, aggregate local geometric semantic features through centre-of-gravity-driven feature curve analysis to resolve implicit spatial relationships between entities. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed network achieves favourable performance on the ModelNet40, ShapeNet, and S3DIS datasets."

Next, narrowband STAP filtering is performed in parallel across all range cells and bearing angles to generate a two-dimensional range-bearing power map. Semi-physical/synthetic results demonstrate that SWRB-STAP can significantly suppress clutter and reliably detect weak targets in reverberant environments."

The proposed Android application simplifies the process of rendering spatial audio signals with an average latency of 1.27 ms per 20 ms input frame. It maintains a low computational overhead (average CPU usage of 30.6 %), ensuring seamless customized spatial audio processing and rendering over mobile devices. The user interface is designed to be highly intuitive, as validated by subjective evaluations using Mean Opinion Score (MOS) ratings from 15 participants, who reported high user satisfaction and spatial realism (average MOS of 4.72 out of 5). The system supports dynamic listener movement and interactive control over sound source positioning, enhancing sound customization in different acoustic environments.

We also investigate the required keep-out distance, i.e., the separation distance between HAPS and UAV that ensures a target interference probability. Numerical results demonstrate how these parameters affect the interference probability, emphasizing the importance of careful deployment of both aerial platforms and the planning of their respective ground service coverages."

Agile processes usually encounter variable task requirements and priorities as well as limited resources, which make effective allocation a difficult puzzle. We suggest a DRL framework that is using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to manage the dynamic allocations of the resources: the time, the budget, the task assignment of the developers. The authors view the agile process as the modeled system of a custom simulation environment where an agent learns the best policies by trial-and-error interaction. Sprint backlogs, team capacities, and task complexity determine the state, and velocity, resource utilization, and delivery efficiency determines the rewards, which are sprint velocity, resource utilization, and delivery efficiency. The experiments prove that the DRL approach is respondent to any shifts in the project conditions, as well as highly efficient in comparison with the static allocation strategies in terms of velocity and efficiency as well. The framework favours resource management in agile teams with an intelligent solution to scaling, making it the first step towards smarter inclusive project management in more voluminous and dynamic development environments."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth in deep learning (DL) model complexity has escalated computational demands, making efficient GPU cluster scheduling critical for managing resources and minimizing job queuing times. Traditional scheduling approaches, such as preemptive and optimization-based methods, often introduce significant overhead or require intrusive modifications, limiting their practicality in production environments. We propose the Hierarchical Simple Scheduler (HiSS), a lightweight, nonpreemptive scheduling framework that classifies DL jobs into four categories based on GPU demand and runtime, scheduling them hierarchically using tailored heuristics like Quasi-Shortest-Service-First (QSSF). By prioritizing small, short jobs and mitigating head-of-line blocking, HiSS achieves significant reductions in average Job Queuing Time (JQT). Additionally, we explore flexible scheduling policies within each category, allowing combinations of QSSF, Shortest-Job-First (SJF), and Tiny-JobFirst (TJF) strategies to adapt to diverse workloads. Evaluations on real-world traces from the Helios dataset demonstrate that HiSS outperforms baselines like SJF and QSSF, with flexible policy configurations yielding further improvements. HiSS offers a practical, low-overhead solution for production-grade GPU clusters, balancing efficiency and simplicity, making it easily deployable in production-grade GPU clusters."

    "abstract": "Purpose-bred laboratory animals are underrepresented in the animal-computer interaction (ACI) literature. What the ACI community has published on research with such animals suggests that there are no examples of work utilizing animal-centered approaches. Globally, hundreds of millions of rats and mice are kept for scientific research, representing an overwhelming majority of vertebrate laboratory animals. Standard caging for rats prevents them from exhibiting some natural behaviors, including standing on their hind legs, gnawing to wear down their incisors, and living in social groups. Nonetheless, there is a significant body of laboratory animal welfare research that has been developed since the 1940s that is focused on the effects of enriched housing conditions on rats. An investigatory review of laboratory animal welfare literature reveals, a subset of recent scholarship (n=32) in this area takes interest in transitioning toward an animal-centered ethical framework. That work is happening independently of and parallel to the ACI community’s development of its own animal-centered ethics. In this literature review of laboratory animal science journals, half of the articles on rat (and/or mouse) welfare already used technologies that could be leveraged for ACI research. Slightly less than half (47%) of articles were considered to be ethically incompatible with ACI, at least partially. However, only 3 (9%) papers were identified representing work that were wholly incompatible. Of the remaining 53% of articles that were compatible with ACI, 4 (13%) were identified as functionally equivalent to ACI’s ethical framework, i.e., animal-centered. This finding stands in opposition to prior ACI work that suggested there were likely no examples of animal-centered research with laboratory animals. Clear opportunities for researchers in the ACI community to collaborate with laboratory animal scientists on research projects improving the well-being of rats and mice, and ultimately to all lab animals."

    "abstract": "Runaway electrons (RAEs), overcoming friction drag and continuously accelerated by the external electric field, are universally observed in gas discharge phenomena both in nature and in the laboratory. This work investigates the generation of RAEs and their interaction with discharge plasma during pulsed gas breakdown. It is demonstrated that the micro-protrusion on the cathode and its electric field enhancement are critical to the initial acceleration of field emission electrons with low energy and dictate the flux of RAEs. Furthermore, the second electron acceleration process during breakdown initiation and potential lift-up due to plasma screening near the cathode determine the formation of anomalous energy RAEs, which have an energy higher than the potential difference between the cathode and anode. These RAEs, experiencing decreasing friction drag with energy, will maintain their energy during the ionization wave propagation formed as gas breakdown happens and induce pre-ionization ahead of the ionization wave front. A promoted density of seed electrons will improve the randomness of discharge channels and help to form a diffuse wide streamer with a diameter comparable to the discharge gap. This work illustrates the critical factors for forming RAEs and their effect on gas breakdown."

The extreme current densities and voltages in the Z Machine MITL give rise to significant challenges in its design, operation, and performance optimization. Effects such as field emission, explosive electron emission, and thermal desorption of contaminants can generate plasmas on electrode surfaces, which significantly affects machine performance. These environments are difficult to diagnose in situ due to limited diagnostic access in this region and the low frequency of shots per year. Therefore, a test platform, a Uniform-Field Parallel-Plate Platform (UFP3), has been developed to replicate the MITL current densities of multi-MJ pulsed power generators on university scale <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(\\square 100 \\text{kJ})$</tex> drivers. The platform enables the generation of uniform, tunable fields while providing a direct line of sight through the electrode gap for enhanced diagnostic access. Here we present diagnostic results of the UFP3 fielded on the COBRA driver at Cornell University, including 12 -frame visible self-emission imaging, XUV imaging, avalanche photodiodes (APDs), gated visible spectroscopy (GVS), interferometry and shadowgraphy for kA pulses with a ns rise time. 12 -frame imaging and APD data show that the plasma self-emission consistently turns on at the same time for all experiments, proving the repeatability of this platform and its utility as a power flow platform to collect much more data than on Z alone."

However, due to the coupling effects of complex multi-scale physical processes in DPF, it is difficult to achieve high-precision simulation of its entire physical process with a traditional single numerical model. In this paper, a particle-fluid hybrid model is established to study the dynamic process of dense plasma focus. In the hybrid simulation, the particle method is used to simulate kinetic ions, the fluid method is used to simulate electrons, and the Maxwell equation and FDTD (finite difference time domain) method are used to solve the electromagnetic field. Aiming at the time step advancement of hybrid simulation, the self-consistent explicit iteration of hybrid simulation is realized by using the prediction-correction method. Plasma acceleration, pinch and final focus formation are covered in the simulation, and the interaction of various physical effects such as electromagnetic field, fluid mechanics and particle dynamics are considered. On this basis, we compare the simulation results with the experimental data. The simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental data in terms of the spatialtemporal evolution of the plasma and the physical characteristics of the plasma focus region, which verifies the effectiveness and reliability of the hybrid simulation method."

    "abstract": "The BEST is a Tokamak fusion device for achieving D-T (deuterium-tritium) burning, where the DC Link serves as the critical electrical circuit for delivering current and voltage from the magnet power supply to the superconducting coil. This function is essential for controlling plasma shape, position, and providing ohmic heating. Long-pulse operation of Tokamak devices demands precise thermal management to ensure stable performance, making it vital to regulate the operating temperature of DC Link within a defined range. In this paper, the thermal equilibrium analysis of DC Link designed for a rated current of 55 kA is presented. Utilizing DC Link's low inductance and high insulation properties, the positive and negative conductors are assembled in insulating layers and metallic casing. The temperature distribution within the conductors and insulating materials under two cooling scenarios is analysed: without cooling water and with water cooling for long-pulse operation. Additionally, the impact of contact resistance on the temperature rise at the junctions of the multi-terminal busbar is calculated. The relationship between busbar length, conductor, metallic casing and insulating material temperatures, and flow velocity is analysed by the finite-element method. The maximum operating time of the DC busbars without cooling water is analysed to ensure the reliability of the DC Link system. This work provides critical insights into the thermal management of high-current DC Link systems for superconducting magnets in long-pulse Tokamak operations."

    "abstract": "Plasma-induced methane pyrolysis is a promising hydrogen production method. However, few studies have focused the decomposition of pure methane as a discharge gas. Herein, a rotating gliding arc reactor was used for the conversion of methane (discharge gas and feedstock) into hydrogen and solid carbon. Methane conversion, gaseous product selectivity, and energy usage efficiency (specific energy requirement for hydrogen production (SER)) were investigated as functions of operating parameters, e.g., specific energy input (SEI), residence time, and reactor design. SEI was positively (almost linearly) correlated with methane conversion and hydrogen yield and negatively correlated with SER. Conversion and efficiency of energy usage increased when reactor designs providing higher thermal densities were used. With the increasing flow rate of methane at constant SEI, the reaction volume and, hence, the effective residence time of the gas inside the reaction zone increased, which resulted in methane conversion and hydrogen selectivity enhancement. The solid carbon featured four distinct domains, namely graphitic carbon, turbostratic carbon, multilayer graphene, and amorphous carbon, which indicated a nonuniform temperature distribution in the reaction zone. But it seems that graphitic carbon dominates amorhphous one. This study highlights the potential of rotating gliding arc plasma systems for efficient methane conversion into hydrogen and valuable solid carbon products."

    "abstract": "Distributed renewable energy (DRE) systems, such as so larpanels, wind turbines, and small-scale hydroelectric systems, are increasingly participating in electricity markets. The unpredictable nature of renewable energy imposes a significant impact on the strategic offering decisions of DRE producers in two-settlement electricity markets. Furthermore, small-scale DRE producers face challenges, such as minimum size threshold requirements, that prevent them from par ticipating in wholesale electricity markets. Driven by these issues, this work proposes a blockchain-aided coalitional game framework to enable the cooperative renewable offering strategies of distributed producers, wherein these producers are incentivized to form a grand coalition to participate in electricity markets and share real-time balancing risks. Moreover, it is verified that the grand coalition is optimal for maximizing the total profit of the producers, indicating the benefit of cooperation. It is challenging to obtain the core of the coalition due to the huge computational complexity. Nevertheless, a closed-form profit allocation mechanism is constructed and proved to be in the core of the coalition. This indicates that none of these producers has an incentive to leave the grand coalition. Furthermore, we design a smart contract to automate the coalition formation and profit allocation processes of DRE producers on the blockchain. Finally, numerical studies are conducted to validate the established theoretical results. Simulation results show that the proposed approach increases individual utility for all participants and improves the system's overall profit by up to 9.4% compared with the independent baseline."

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) enables efficient machine learning by connecting terminal devices to coordinate distributed model training. In typical scenarios, each device is treated as a computing node, training local models with its local data and updating the global model by exchanging parameters with neighbors. However, as the dataset scales grow, communication costs limit the scalability of distributed machine-learning algorithms. Moreover, parameters sharing increases the risk of privacy leakage. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a distributed alternating direction method of multipliers based on load balancing sparse allreduce (LBSA-ADMM). Unlike traditional distributed ADMM algorithms, LBSA-ADMM requires each node to compute and communicate only its associated features, drastically reducing overhead. More importantly, LBSA is tailored for performing allreduce on transmission parameters of all nodes. LBSA divides transmission parameters according to the weight of each feature, effectively balancing communication overhead across nodes. Furthermore, the paper proposes a differential privacy ADMM (DP-LBSA-ADMM) to enhance the security of LBSA-ADMM by injecting noise into penalty parameters. This algorithm dynamically adjusts penalty parameters to balance accuracy and privacy, with convergence guaranteed theoretically and empirically. Experimental results demonstrate that LBSA significantly reduces communication costs compared to state-of-the-art methods, DP-LBSA-ADMM achieves faster convergence than comparable ADMM algorithms."

    "abstract": "Water vapor, the most influential greenhouse gas, is central to Earth’s climate system, affecting the hydrological cycle, energy balance, and atmospheric dynamics. Integrated Water Vapor (IWV) is a key variable for understanding these processes. However, conventional IWV retrieval methods—such as ground-based sensors, satellite observations, and numerical weather models (NWM)—are often limited by spatial resolution, temporal continuity, and retrieval accuracy. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel deep learning method GMLSTM-HIM, a High-resolution IWV estimation Model (HIM) based on a Gaussian Mixture Long Short-Term Memory (GMLSTM) framework. By integrating Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and NWM inputs, including weighted mean temperature, GMLSTM-HIM utilizes a bidirectional LSTM structure and probabilistic output sequences to improve IWV estimation accuracy while quantifying uncertainty arising from spatial heterogeneity. Compared to ERA5 and VMF3, the model achieves average RMSE reductions of 68.44% and 36.15%, respectively. The model’s performance is further evaluated through inter-comparisons with MODIS and Fengyun satellite-derived IWV products, highlighting both the accuracy of GMLSTM-HIM and the complementary strengths of satellite observations. The results suggest that, of the satellite datasets examined in this case study, the MODIS 5 km product exhibits the highest consistency with the GMLSTM-HIM model estimates, outperforming the higher-resolution MODIS 1 km and FY-3D 1 km products in terms of product reliability (measured by root mean square error and correlation). A data fusion strategy is also proposed, combining model and satellite estimates to preserve fine-scale details and enhance robustness. Overall, GMLSTM-HIM provides a robust framework for high-resolution IWV retrieval, with significant potential to advance atmospheric studies, climate surveillance, and operational weather forecasting within the remote sensing community."

    "abstract": "Covert communication can reduce the security overhead of messages in New Radio (NR) Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) and provide a higher level of privacy assurance. However, it also introduces a tradeoff between covertness and transmission. In this paper, we explore the tradeoff between covertness and transmission in NR V2X communications and propose a covert scheme, Covert Semi-Persistent Scheduling (C-SPS). To elucidate this tradeoff in the traditional case, we derive the theoretical results based on stochastic geometry, which accounts for the fundamental processes of semi-persistent scheduling, including transport block re-selection and resource collision. Based on our derivation, the optimal setting of C-SPS is obtained to maximize the covertness of message delivery while satisfying the transmission requirements of NR V2X. More importantly, we assess the covert threat posed by intelligent adversaries equipped with the Large Language Model (LLM) capable of reasoning based on the tailored chain of thought. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of C-SPS in balancing the tradeoff under both traditional case and LLM-assisted case."

A key challenge in this context is the effective extraction of dynamically interactive multimodal features to enrich conversational emotion representations. However, existing approaches are often constrained by non-end-to-end architectures, overlooking the significance of feature extraction in MER. To address the problem of dynamic interaction in emotion feature extraction, this paper introduces an end-to-end network based on Cross-Modal Hybrid Prompt Learning (CoMPLe). The model takes raw video as input and leverages three prompt mechanisms to guide large-scale pre-trained encoders in extracting emotionally salient features with latent correlations. Specifically, we design a cross-modal soft prompt learning strategy to mine complementary information across modalities and dynamically adjust the cross-modal semantic space. To capture stage-dependent characteristics, deep feature prompts are incorporated to progressively learn intra-modal contextual representations. Furthermore, a label prompt mechanism is proposed to construct hard prompt templates from emotion labels. Finally, the highest cosine similarity is computed between each unimodal feature and the label prompt templates to activate factual knowledge relevant to emotion recognition. Experiments on three public datasets show that the end-to-end network proposed in this paper surpasses the existing State-Of-The-Art baselines."

Virtual surgical planning (VSP) is indispensable for precise and individualized treatment. Manually designing osteotomy planes is time-consuming and highly experience-dependent. This study aimed to develop and validate an automatic osteotomy plane design method based on deep learning. Methods: A deep learning model, Ortho-OPD (orthognathic osteotomy planes de signer), was proposed, consisting of a segmentation network and the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. The segmentation network was based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), orthognathic segmenting the craniomaxillofacial (CMF) CT data. Osteotomy planes were then defined by the RANSAC algorithm. Ortho-OPD was trained on 71 samples and tested on 31 cases. The performance was evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively. Results: Ortho-OPD functioned smoothly, and all cases were successfully performed. The 3D boundary-sensitive loss was employed to optimize precision. Evaluation metrics included accuracy and clinical efficiency. The mean dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was 0.920.032 in CMF seg mentation. Ortho-OPD showcased excellent productivity, taking an average of about 9 seconds to complete virtual bimaxillary osteotomy compared to manual work. The angular errors between the predicted planes and ground truth planes, plus the shortest distance from the neural tube or the adjacent apical points to predicted planes, were examined, indicating no significant difference and reliability for preserving vital anatomical structures. Overall, the automatic osteotomy plane design from raw CT data was realized using Ortho-OPD, composed of CNN and RANSAC, providing an efficient and ideal alternative in orthognathic osteotomy planning."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of big data demands robust frameworks to ensure data quality in distributed platforms, as poor data quality undermines insights in domains like e-commerce and social media analytics. Traditional PySpark-based validation excels in syntactic checks (e.g., pattern violations) but struggles with semantic anomalies (e.g., sentiment drift, null detection). Large Language Models (LLMs) offer context-aware validation but face scalability and cost challenges. This study proposes an Adaptive Hybrid framework that integrates PySpark’s rule-based efficiency with AI-powered contextual validation in Microsoft Fabric’s Lakehouse environment to deliver high-performance data quality assessment. The framework uses a composite performance score (F = 0.4A + 0.4S − 0.2E) to quantify trade-offs in accuracy (A), scalability (S = 1/T), and development effort (E), ensuring reliable and efficient validation without runtime optimization. The weights reflect enterprise priorities for precision and throughput. Evaluated across four data quality scenarios null detection, pattern violations, semantic mismatches, and sentiment drift using real-world Twitter airline sentiment and Amazon product review datasets, the framework achieves high accuracy (~0.9), scalability (1.898 s for 5,000 rows in syntactic tasks), and low effort (E ≈ 0.3). PySpark dominates syntactic validation (F1-score = 0.791 for pattern violations), while AI and Hybrid methods significantly improve semantic recall (0.674 for mismatches). Unlike prior syntactic-only or text-classification frameworks, this approach bridges structured data quality gaps, offering a scalable, intelligent solution for modern analytics platforms."

However, when applied to the control of grid-connected converters, it still faces several practical problems such as high current distortion, variable switching frequency and wide harmonic spectra. Although various improved MPC strategies have been proposed, how to solve the above problems of FCS-MPC only using the finite control set manner is still a challenge. In this article, a novel finite control set model predictive control for three-phase two-level grid-connected converters designated as high-resolution extended FCS-MPC (EFCS-MPC) have been proposed. By redefining the possible selectable switching options within a control cycle, the number of options within the control set of a three-phase two-level converter can be increased from 8 to millions, only limited by the capabilities of the selected digital controller (e.g. DSP or FPGA). The proposed method can not only reduce current distortion, and realize fixed switching frequency but also can keep the advantages of the FCS-MPC such as high dynamic response speed, simple and straightforward structures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed high-resolution EFCS-MPC can significantly outperform the conventional FCS-MPC."

To identify cancer-specific signals using THz radiation, DNA from various cancer cells was observed to exhibit a resonance feature at approximately 1.6 THz, which was attributed to DNA hypermethylation. DNA methylation is an epigenetic alteration that precedes genetic mutations during cancer development. Although pharmaceutical demethylation agents effectively reduce DNA methylation, they cause numerous side effects. We demonstrated that 1.6-THz radiation can effectively reduce the level of DNA methylation in cancer cells and tissues, as well as in extracted DNA.

    "abstract": "Multimodal multiobjective optimization problems (MMOPs) feature multiple Pareto sets (PSs) corresponding to a single Pareto front (PF). While most multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MMEAs) focus on locating multiple global PSs, they tend to overlook local PSs that provide valuable decision diversity despite exhibiting slightly inferior objective values. In this paper, a bi-directional coevolutionary algorithm, termed MMEA-BDC, is proposed for MMOPs with local PSs, which integrates tractive and diffusive search mechanisms to simultaneously discover both global and local PSs. Specifically, the tractive mechanism preserves the individuals with the best fitness, which tend to be located around global PSs, thereby guiding the search toward the global PF. Meanwhile, the diffusive mechanism evaluates individual fitness based on an improved local convergence indicator, allowing individuals near local PSs to be identified and preserved, thereby promoting convergence toward local PF. These individuals are further refined through a niche-driven filter to retain those contributing to decision space diversity. Additionally, a dual-space neighbor replacement strategy is designed to comprehensively consider the crowding degree of individuals in both decision and objective spaces, effectively balancing population diversity across the two spaces. Experimental results on several benchmark suites of MMOPs demonstrate that MMEA-BDC effectively discovers both global and local PSs and achieves superior competitiveness compared to seven state-of-the-art MMEAs."

    "abstract": "Multi-source hybrid power systems combining fuel cells (FC), lithium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors (SC) are increasingly considered as viable alternatives to fossil-fuel propulsion for long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), due to their improved energy efficiency, extended mission duration, and reduced environmental impact. For these systems, the energy management stratregy (EMS) must alocate the power demand in a way to maximize the life-time. This paper compares two strategies using a rule-based approach within the frequency domain. The first strategy is based on a fixed cut-off frequency to distribute load current across multiple sources. In contrast, the second strategy dynamically adapts the switching frequency according to the state of charge of the SC. A complete model of the hybrid energy system is developed, and a systematic tuning procedure for both control strategies is presented. Performance comparison on different flight cycles shows a significant reduction in FC current variations with the adaptive frequency strategy, thus limiting ageing. The results show that this approach requires low computing power, does not require additional equipment, but improves performance for all flight cycles."

However, fine-grained data-at-rest security remains a critical challenge, especially in distributed computing scenarios where sensitive data spans across multiple confidential containers. We present FIMFS, a FUSE-based in-memory secure file system designed to provide container-level storage isolation and persistent data encryption on the host. By integrating with a trusted key management system (KMS), FIMFS enables automated per-container key provisioning and transparent data protection without host awareness. To further address the I/O performance bottlenecks typical of FUSE, FIMFS leverages the advantages of a tmpfs-backed in-memory layer for reads and writes, combined with an asynchronous mechanism for persisting data from containers to disks. We have implemented FIMFS on a SEV-enabled Kata container cluster and evaluated its performance under microbenchmarks and Hadoop workloads. Extensive experimental results show that FIMFS achieves strong security guarantees with a very small performance overhead, offering a practical and efficient solution for secure data storage in distributed confidential computing environments."

While alignment techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) improve model behavior, they are not sufficient to prevent harmful outputs. This paper reviews recent approaches that use foundation models themselves as guardrails systems that monitor or filter inputs and outputs for safety. We cover LLM-based moderation, neural classifiers, and multimodal safety filters, highlighting both academic advances and industry tools. We also discuss empirical evaluation methods such as red teaming and adversarial prompting. Finally, we outline open challenges in robustness, interpretability, and policy adaptation, pointing to key directions for building trustworthy guardrails for generative AI."

    "abstract": "The challenge of diagnosis for Alzheimer’s disease stems from its gradual onset and overlap of symptoms with other cognitive disorders, fostering delays in clinical identification and subsequent treatment. A deep learning-based classification model, built using multimodal data, could possibly address the diagnostic gap by integrating various types of information including brain imaging scans, genetic data, and data scores from cognitive tests. The attention-based neural network with cross-modal integration was able to derive useful information from MRI scans, gene expression data, and neuropsychological scores. The lack of interpretability and rigid data assumptions in conventional deep learning modelling has hindered the acceptance of such models for clinical use with real-world heterogeneous datasets. A transformer-inspired architecture with dynamic feature weighting was used in the network to allow the model to highlight the relevant biomarkers across modalities. Training and validation on the ADNI dataset exhibited top classification performance with very high accuracy, random forest empathy (sensitivity), and F1 across Alzheimer's disease states. Transfers from unimodal models exhibiting poor generalization were mitigated through external validation confirming the stability of the model even with unseen subjects. The integration of spatial, genetic, and behavioral streams permitted the network to capture some subtle clinically-important indicators of meaning in etiology and disease progression. The addition of explanation components in the form of attention heatmaps that provide clarity of which modalities were attending to specific areas of significance and the feature importance components of classification across all clinical cases (AD level)."

This has created a need for implementations that provide sufficient confidentiality while working effectively within modern mobile devices. End-to-end encryption protocols like Off-The-Record (OTR) and Signal, that most chat applications adapt, ensure privacy but impose additional computational demands on devices with limited but varied resources. This paper compares WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal, analyzing their resource consumption patterns during encrypted message transmission. By measuring CPU usage, GPU usage, and memory footprint, we evaluate how these applications manage workload to balance security and efficiency using modern hardware. We propose an encryption optimization approach with CPU offloading that min-imizes resource utilization while retaining acceptable standards for confidentiality, crucial for applications operating in mobile hardware."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has seen widespread adoption in privacy-sensitive domains. However, handling Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data, particularly in terms of detection and generalization, remains a significant challenge, as most existing methods address these issues separately. This separation often leads to the misclassification of OOD inputs and the rejection of generalizable samples. The challenge is further amplified in federated settings due to data heterogeneity and the need to ensure generalization across a diverse set of clients. Models are required not only to identify semantically shifted inputs but also to avoid misclassifying unseen classes from other clients as OOD, all while maintaining both intra-client and inter-client generalization. To tackle these challenges, FedGSV is proposed as a novel detection method driven by a federated global leading singular vector. FedGSV integrates self-supervised pretraining with local attention-based feature enhancement. Specifically, it employs self-supervised contrastive learning during the pretraining phase to learn feature representations with strong generalization capabilities. During the fine-tuning phase, it introduces a Partial Class Activation Attention (PCAA) module to enhance the stability of local features. During inference, FedGSV constructs a Global Singular Vector (GSV) by aggregating dominant singular vectors from all clients, enabling efficient and reliable OOD detection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FedGSV consistently improves OOD detection performance across a variety of datasets and heterogeneous environments, while also achieving strong generalization. These findings suggest that FedGSV provides a promising and robust solution for practical federated scenarios involving OOD detection and OOD generalization."

Although machine learning has shown promise in addressing these challenges, many studies either focus on a narrow range of models or lack comparative performance insights. In this study, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of ten machine learning algorithms for music genre classification using the widely adopted GTZAN dataset. The models include Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), among others. Our results demonstrate that XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy at 90.09%, outperforming Random Forest (81.42%) and KNN (80.58%) by a significant margin. Feature importance analysis highlights that percussive, harmonic, and spectral features contribute most substantially to genre discrimination. Notably, XGBoost’s superior performance suggests its ability to effectively capture non-linear patterns in musical features, offering a strong alternative to traditional classifiers. This work contributes a broad comparative analysis and emphasizes the effectiveness of ensemble-based approaches in music genre classification, providing valuable insights for future research and practical applications in music information retrieval."

Firstly, a scalable observer-based controller is designed to address complex situations where system states are difficult to measure directly. Secondly, unlike the limited cascade and ring topology connections in previous results, this study considers a universal arbitrary topology. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the plug-and-play (PnP) capability of LSSs is guaranteed thanks to the proposed scalable scheme. Specifically, when subsystems are added or removed, only the controller gains of directly connected neighbors need updating, eliminating the need to redesign the entire system. Moreover, by choosing a Lyapunov-Krasovskii function with a quadratic matrix-valued polynomial, sufficient conditions are deduced to guarantee the global exponential stability with the desired extended dissipative performance for the resulting LSSs. Finally, the effectiveness of the employed scheme is verified by numerical and microgrid examples."

Previously we had studied the impedance of such PEOS under different applied voltage with a PIC code simulation, now we study the behavior of such PEOS under a preset magnetic field. The magnetic field should affect the flow of the electrons, and changes the properties of the PEOS, both in current and impedance."

    "abstract": "Accurate vehicle localization is a cornerstone for the safe and efficient operation of autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems. Conventional GPS-aided localization experiences serious degradations of its accuracy when used in urban settings because of the multipath effect, signal blocking, and poor satellite sighting. This paper presents a ground breaking hybrid localization scheme that combines Collaborative Map Matching (CMM), Responsive Base Stations (RBS), and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) data sharing towards the improvement of localization accuracy and reliability in an enhanced way. The procedure consists of simultaneous use of real-time data input of GPS, inertial sensors, and onboard vehicle systems and their synchronization with the transformation into a local coordinate system. Also through strategically placed base stations one has the support of triangle signals (Time of Arrival (ToA) and Angle of Arrival (AoA) on the one hand, and to correlate the routes of vehicles using HD maps and environmental characteristics on the other (map matching). Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) can have an input of multiple sensors that are combined to provide the final result of position reading. Experimental testing on urban, suburban, and rural conditions demonstrates that the described system has an average localization accuracy of 0.42 meters, which is way better when compared to the standalone GPS (2.63 meters) and the traditional biased GPS (1.19 meters). The proposed system is also characterized by excellent map-matching accuracy (97.3%) and a confidence level of more than 95% in different contexts. By combining these three concepts, resilient end-to-end vehicle localization with the potential to enable autonomous navigation in a multi-sensor complex real-world environment becomes a reality."

In environments that provide dedicated APIs or where direct memory manipulation, this requirement can be relatively easily met. However, many games, especially the older ones, have built-in security mechanisms that restrict access to external modifications of memory. This limitation represents a significant obstacle for researchers and developers who wish to explore the interaction between artificial intelligence and such gaming environments. Simultaneously, the availability of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT (Generative pre-trained transformer), opens up new opportunities in the direction of high-level strategic reasoning. These models are capable of interpreting structured input and generating complex decisions like human reasoning. In this paper, we will focus on extracting the game state using the YOLO algorithm, both for detecting and classifying objects such as units, buildings, and types of resources, as well as for recognizing the numbers necessary for extracting resource values (food, wood, gold). Once this state is obtained, the goal will be on comparing several LLMs in generating strategies for the game, using two distinct approaches: zero-shot and few-shot."

    "abstract": "Counterfactual explanations (CFs) have become a key technique for validating the decisions of machine-learning models at the level of individual instances. However, conventional search-based algorithms incur (i) high computational cost owing to random or evolutionary exploration and (ii) inflated distances when many one-hot categorical features are present in tabular data. We introduce AIM-CF, a fast and precise CF generator that extends the Approximate Inverse Model Explanation (AIME) framework. AIM-CF consists of three deterministic stages: (1) minimal categorical flipping guided by the global feature importance derived from a representative prototype, (2) axis-wise bisection that shrinks each continuous variable to the decision boundary, and (3) micro-random refinement, which removes residual diagonal slack. The entire procedure requires only forward evaluations of the black-box model and no gradients. On the UCI Heart-Disease dataset, AIM-CF reduces the mean L2 distance from 0.92 (DiCE-Random) to 0.83 while cutting average generation time from 1.78 s to 0.10 s on a CPU—a 17-fold acceleration—and achieves a 100 % success rate versus 97 % for DiCE. These results demonstrate that AIM-CF surpasses the existing methods in terms of distance, speed, and robustness for tabular data containing both categorical and continuous attributes. We conclude by discussing how AIM-CF can be combined with other inverse-problem XAI techniques to provide actionable and explainable decision support in medical and financial applications."

    "abstract": "The electron density of plasma is an important measure of the characteristics of plasma, and many diagnostic tools have been designed and studied to measure the electron density [1]–[3]. Among them, the plasma absorption probe (PAP) can obtain the electron density of plasma by using the resonance of the wave oscillating on the surface of plasma. Theoretically, when a metal and a dielectric are in contact and exist in infinite space, resonance occurs at the surface wave resonance (SWR) frequency, which is <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0.707 \\times$</tex> electron plasma frequency (Hz). The resonant frequency depends not only on the electron density of plasma, but also on the probe geometry and the sheath thickness [3]. These characteristics make the electron density measurement by PAP uncertain or impossible, which is a problem that needs to be solved in order to measure the electron density by PAP."

It includes privacy-preserving approaches like federated learning and homomorphic encryption, as well as sophisticated machine learning (ML) models like collaborative filtering, deep learning (DL), and reinforcement learning (RL). Real-time anomaly detection, adversarial training for robustness, hybrid recommendation algorithms with attention mechanisms, and secure data preparation. Early experimental results indicate promising improvements. Although the assault success rate remained around 15%, the model's precision, recall, and F1-score were 0.72, 0.68, and 0.70, respectively. Additionally, the user capacity increased to 10,000 within 90 ms of reaction time. It enhances consumer satisfaction and resilience to cyberthreats by improving personalization accuracy, security, and scalability."

Conventional methods such as the synchronous reference frame phase-locked loop (SRF-PLL) and dual second-order generalized integrator PLL (DSOGI-PLL) provide effective performance under nominal conditions but often encounter challenges during grid disturbances, such as phase jumps and frequency drops. This paper proposes a novel static synchronization (SS) method coupled with DSOGI, which we call the DSOGI-SS. The SS method generates synchronized sine and cosine signals through algebraic equations on instantaneous three-phase voltage measurements, avoiding the PLL and sine function generators. A detailed stability analysis is performed, and the frequency response characteristics of DSOGI-PLL and DSOGI-SS are compared. Furthermore, time-domain simulations under phase jump and frequency variation scenarios are conducted in the PLECS environment to validate the performance of the proposed method. The results indicate that DSOGI-SS exhibits improved high-frequency response characteristics and significantly faster synchronization during transient events, rendering it a promising solution for inverter control in modern power systems."

To address this issue, we introduce EIGait, an advanced environment independent gait recognition system leveraging Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI). Unlike conventional Wi-Fi based gait recognition systems, EIGait aims to achieve high recognition accuracy while ensuring robustness against environmental changes. Specifically, EIGait extracts human gait features by fusing time-frequency features from spectrograms with temporal features related to phase changes, capturing more comprehensive and distinctive gait patterns. It then transforms these features from different environments into a uniform, environment independent feature space, ensuring consistent system performance across different environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of EIGait, we implemented EIGait on commercial Wi-Fi devices and evaluated its performance across four distinct indoor environments. Experimental results demonstrate that EIGait outperforms existing gait recognition systems, consistently delivering superior performance even in challenging settings."

    "abstract": "Repackaging attacks represent a critical vector for distributing mobile malware, wherein attackers modify legitimate Android applications and redistribute them with forged signatures. The open nature of Android's ecosystem allows execution of any signed application, regardless of signer authenticity. Existing defenses against repackaging, including detection and anti-repackaging techniques, often exhibit limited practicality, vulnerability to bypassing, and insufficient adaptability for offline environments. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents A-Guard, a lightweight Android application integrity protection framework leveraging Android Verified Boot (AVB). Unlike traditional methods, A-Guard does not depend on internal application protection logic or cloud-based services. Instead, it incorporates integrity verification directly into the Android Activity Management Service (AMS) and Package Management Service (PMS), thus extending AVB's secure boot chain from device boot to application layer. We implemented A-Guard as a prototype within the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). Experimental evaluations demonstrate that A-Guard detects repackaged applications with 100% accuracy, incurs significantly lower startup delays and resource overhead compared to baseline approaches, delivers robust security guarantees with minimal impact on performance, and effectively raises the difficulty for potential attackers. This makes A-Guard a practical and efficient solution for protecting Android applications against repackaging attacks."

The deposition rate generally decreases with increased peak current density. An overview will be given on the experimental results for various target materials and dependence on varying operating parameters such as peak discharge current density and pulse length. With the model it is possible to study the discharge current composition, the electron power absorption mechanisms, the ionization and back-attraction probabilities of the sputtered species, the dominant recycling mechanism, and the working gas rarefaction. We discuss how the discharge current composition varies between different target materials, and how the recycled species, and the processes leading to working gas rarefaction, depend on the target sputter yield [4]."

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed for phase analysis, while scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were used to characterize the microstructure and elemental distribution before and after immersion in HCl solution. After 168 h of immersion, oxygen content within cracks increased markedly, and the distribution of Fe, Cr, and Mo around the cracks exhibited a smooth transition, contrasting with the sharp distribution observed before immersion. At 336 h of immersion, oxygen concentration within the cracks decreased, accompanied by a reduction in Fe, Cr, and Mo contents. These results suggest that initial exposure triggers oxygen-concentrated crevice corrosion and corrosion product accumulation. With extended immersion, the formation of dense Cr/Mo-rich passive films transitions the alloy within the crevice into a passive state, thereby suppressing anodic dissolution kinetics."

The system under consideration, based on two close-spaced rectangular patch antennas, utilizes a metasurface that is in the form of a Jerusalem cross. The simulation results indicate that the impedance bandwidth was extended to 730 MHz, the maximum gain was 9.42 dBi, and the isolation was improved to -25.6 dB. The device has superior diversity performance with an ECC of 0.0019 and a diversity gain of 9.998 dB. Lowest energy loss is illustrated by results that repeatedly show radiation efficiency over 95%. The suggested method outperforms the current state-of-the-art MIMO designs in all that matters.

By unfolding an ISTA scheme equipped with this proximal operator, we obtain non-negative LISTA (NNLISTA), a deep-unfolded network that learns sparse and non-negative representations end-to-end.

Among various modalities, audio and text offer complementary emotional signals, but effectively integrating them remains a challenge due to asynchronous signals, modality imbalance, and static fusion strategies. This paper presents Emot-CM-BERT, a cross-modal framework designed to recognize emotion from audio and text inputs. The model integrates acoustic features—such as intonation, pitch, and rhythm—with semantic features that capture the contextual meaning of language, using a masked multimodal attention mechanism that dynamically fuses information across modalities. To further optimize learning, curriculum learning is employed to progressively introduce training complexity, while class-aware sampling addresses imbalances in emotion label distributions. We evaluate Emot-CM-BERT on three benchmark datasets—CREMA-D, IEMOCAP, and CMU-MOSEI—encompassing both acted and naturalistic emotional expressions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive or superior performance compared to baselines, particularly in real-world, conversational settings. The analysis further confirms its effectiveness in aligning heterogeneous features and generalizing across diverse emotions."

Our experiments, conducted for stress recognition using ECG (Electrocardiogram), EMG (Electromyography), and EDA (Electrodermal Activity) signals reveal that models trained on SPTM-derived representations outperform those trained on raw PTSS. Among all SPTMs, multilingual SPTMs achieve the highest accuracy, supporting our hypothesis and demonstrating their better OOD capabilities.

In this study, a neural network-based model was developed for predicting the performance of electride materials using synthetic datasets.

The model showed high prediction accuracy on test data and demonstrated generalization capability. Visualization via 3D feature through performance surface plots revealed interpretable trends consistent with domain knowledge. The test results validated the effectiveness of machine learning in approximating complex material behaviors, and underscore its potential in accelerating the discovery of novel electrides.

    "abstract": "With the growing demand for personalized education, accurately predicting college students’ English academic performance has become an important and posed a challenge. In this study, an intelligent early warning model was developed based on data mining technology. The model identifies students at risk for timely interventions. Established on multi-source heterogeneous data, including students’ academic history, online learning behaviors, and classroom engagement, the model enhanced prediction accuracy. The data preprocessing phase of the model involves normalization, handling of missing values through imputation, and detection of outliers to ensure data integrity. The model’s performance was evaluated using standard classification metrics. By enabling real-time monitoring of student progress, the developed system helps educators deliver targeted support and improve learning outcomes in English. The model contributes to the advancement of intelligent academic monitoring systems and promotes a data-driven approach to personalized education."

    "abstract": "A pooling mechanism is essential for mean opinion score (MOS) prediction, facilitating the transformation of variable-length audio features into a concise fixed-size representation that effectively encodes speech quality. Existing pooling methods typically operate at a singular granularity, concentrating either on a comprehensive global perspective or a detailed frame-level analysis, which may overlook complementary perceptual insights. To address this limitation, we introduce the Dual-Resolution Attentive Statistics Pooling (DRASP) framework. DRASP integrates both coarse-grained, global statistical summaries and fine-grained, attentive analyses of perceptually significant segments. This dual-view architecture empowers our model to formulate a more thorough and robust representation, capturing both the overarching structural context and salient local details concurrently. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and strong generalization ability of the proposed framework. It consistently outperforms various baseline methods across diverse datasets (MusicEval and AES-Natural), MOS prediction backbones (including a CLAP-based model and AudioBox-Aesthetics), and different audio generation systems, achieving a relative improvement of 10.39 % in system-level Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) over the widely-used average pooling approach."

    "abstract": "System reliability and production efficiency are two important indicators in manufacturing. However, they cannot be optimized simultaneously. In reality, high production efficiency means the accelerated degradation of equipment, leading to an increase in maintenance frequency, which in turn restricts production. Therefore, production and scheduling are two interactive influencing factors in manufacturing. Existing studies ignore the influence of this interaction on the system. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a joint optimization model for scheduling and maintenance in series-parallel flow shop, and constructs an equipment degradation model considering dynamic processing time and job allocation to reflect the mutual influence between scheduling and maintenance. Aiming at the joint optimization problem, a twostage adaptive maintenance strategy is proposed and the corresponding genetic algorithm is designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was verified through numerical experiments."

    "abstract": "Smart contracts, an important component of blockchain technology, have received widespread attention due to their decentralized and trustworthy characteristics. However, the security vulnerabilities of smart contracts pose a serious threat to their reliability, causing huge economic losses to users. Existing analysis tools are used to detect security vulnerabilities in smart contracts. However, due to their excessive reliance on hard rules defined by experts when detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts, the time to perform the detection significantly increases as the complexity of smart contracts increases. In this study, we developed a novel hybrid machine learning model called Bi-CUR. The Bi-CUR model extracts the feature matrix of smart contract opcodes through Bigram and detects smart contract vulnerability through CUR matrix decomposition. It approximates the original matrix by selecting rows and columns, thereby reducing computational complexity while maintaining the features of the data. Compared with traditional vulnerability detection methods, models based on CUR matrix decomposition showed higher efficiency and accuracy. In addition, the model ensured interpretability, which makes it applicable to different types of smart contract vulnerability detection."

Typically, the anode and cathode spacing is chosen such that the device operates in the fundamental quasi-TEM (qTEM) mode, with higher order modes being cut off for frequency stability and ease of extraction.

    "abstract": "With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, an increasing number of intelligent devices are connected to edge environments, leading to a significant growth in the volume of service requests. To enhance service quality under resource constraints, efficient task scheduling is crucial. However, existing approaches typically consume substantial time or computational resources and struggle to achieve a good balance among multiple optimization objectives. To address these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework for Edge Task Scheduling (CoMaTS), which guides large language models (LLMs) to design high-quality scheduling algorithms through the close collaboration of multiple agents(Generator, Praiser, Critic and Optimizer), eliminating the need for additional timeconsuming fine-tuning. The Generator, driven by multiple large language models, is responsible for generating a set of candidate algorithms. The Praiser and Critic analyze the top-scoring and lowest-scoring algorithms respectively, and deliver the reasons to the optimizer. The Optimizer accepts the reasons, conducts a comparison, and provides suggestions for the next-round operation of the generator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with traditional heuristic methods and reinforcement learning approaches, CoMaTS can optimize multiple objectives more effectively. Moreover, compared with the latest LLM-based scheduling methods, it achieves higher performance at a lower cost."

Solving such nonlinear problems is quite slow under non-sinusoidal excitation due to the presence of multiple reversal points. This paper proposes an improved fixed-point iteration algorithm incorporating the Local-coefficient Method(LCM) and an Enhanced Anderson Acceleration(EAA) to efficiently solve the problem of excessive iteration duration. The EAA proposed in this paper, which extends the traditional Anderson Acceleration framework, dynamically adapts the residual window size based on the local residual behavior. This adaptability enables EAA to effectively leverage iterative historical information to expedite computations and accommodate variations in nonlinearity, thereby significantly enhancing the overall computational efficiency. Simulations and experiments under sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal excitations confirm that the proposed iteration algorithm can improve computational efficiency while ensuring stability."

    "abstract": "Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS), the predominant type of peripheral entrapment neuropathy, necessitates timely and precise diagnosis for optimal treatment. While ultrasound (US) has emerged as a non-invasive diagnostic modality, existing computer-aided methods largely rely on static frames or unimodal features, failing to capture the temporal dynamics and multidimensional cues integral to clinical assessment. To address these, we present a panoramic diagnostic system for CTS that harnesses the full potential of US videos. It seamlessly consolidates median nerve segmentation, multi-dimensional biometric measurement, and multimodal CTS classification within a unified pipeline, transforming conventional diagnosis into a comprehensive digital solution. Specifically, we develop a Mamba-based video segmentation model with temporal compression and spectral gated enhancement to enable efficient, high-fidelity delineation and measurement. Building upon this, we propose a Spatiotemporal and Multimodal Processing (STAMP) framework that synergistically integrates video dynamics, anatomical measurements, and clinical covariates through bidirectional metadata-visual interactions and temporal contextualization. This approach mirrors the clinical reasoning process and provides clinically interpretable diagnostic results. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms existing automatic segmentation methods across multiple metrics (Dice=87.18%) and achieves performance comparable to manually initialized ones. Moreover, our system not only surpasses both frame-based and video-based approaches (F1-score=97.44%), but also exceeds that of junior radiologists and rivals senior experts."

    "abstract": "In industrial settings, robotic tasks often require interaction with various objects, necessitating compliant manipulation to prevent damage while accurately tracking reference forces. Interaction controllers are typically employed for this purpose, but they need either human tinkering for parameter tuning or precise environmental modeling. Both these aspects can be problematic, as the former is a time-consuming procedure, and the latter is unavoidably affected by approximations, hence being prone to failure during the actual application. In order to address these challenges, the current research focuses on designing high-performance force controllers. Along this line, this work introduces optimized residual action for interaction control with learned environments (ORACLE), a novel force control approach. Exploiting neural networks, ORACLE predicts robot–environment interaction forces, which are then used in an optimal residual action controller to locally correct actions from a base force controller, minimizing the force-tracking error. Tested on a real Franka Emika Panda robot, ORACLE demonstrates superior force-tracking performance compared with the state-of-the-art controllers, with a short setup time."

Satellite resources are scarce due to volume and power constraints, forcing most tasks to be processed on the ground and hindering SCPNs practical application. To meet the elastic resource requirements of IoT, SCPN requires that each satellite node share its resources with others. However, the closedness of traditional satellite architecture cannot meet this requirement. Given that, this paper introduces a novel efficient satellite hardware architecture designed for accelerating SCPN named Efficient Satellite Hardware Architecture (ESHA), which is capable of fast and flexible satellite resource sharing. Through reorganizing the satellite system, ESHA enables the satellites to share resources among modules to aggregate resources for tasks in IoT. Besides, this paper presents a queuing network method to model and analyze ESHA and evaluate its performance. The experimental results show that, for the same type of parallel tasks, the speedup ratio of this architecture is 2.4 times higher than that of the traditional satellite architecture, the task completion time is reduced by 48%, and the utilization of satellite resources is effectively improved."

These challenges, compounded by environmental constraints, make image restoration and enhancement particularly difficult. To address these issues, this paper introduces IterWaveFold-NET (IWF NET), a synergistic multi-stage network designed for the progressive refinement of underwater images. Specifically, a joint pre optimization module is introduced to perform color correction and detail refinement, leveraging Residual Color Correction Blocks (RCCB) and Nonlinear Activation-Free Block (NAFB) to improve image clarity and suppress noise. A dual-domain attention-guided feature fusion paradigm based on DSAAB is employed to enhance texture detail recovery and contrast, effectively reinforcing critical feature representation. Furthermore, the integration of Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization and positive channel attention mechanisms improves feature extraction and fusion, preserving image edges and maintaining color balance. Experimental results on multiple underwater image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves enhancement quality, validating its effectiveness in underwater image enhancement tasks."

RF amplifiers are integral in driving processes such as plasma etching, deposition, and ion implantation, where stable and consistent RF power is essential for uniform wafer processing. During these processes, both CW mode and pulsing are often used simultaneously to achieve specific process characteristics. As a result, the RF amplifier's immunity to pulsing is a key factor in ensuring stable and optimal performance. Traditional evaluation methods typically focus on parameters such as output power, gain, and efficiency but often overlook the amplifier's response to RF pulsing conditions that are commonly encountered during semiconductor processing. While simple pulse injection techniques exist, they often fail to replicate the complex, real-world conditions under which amplifiers operate during plasma processes. This makes them less effective in testing amplifier immunity to RF pulsing, a crucial aspect for the reliability and performance of semiconductor processes."

The electric charge of emitted electrons will have an effect on the electric field on the cathode, and subsequently may have an effect on current density from the cathode. This space-charge effect is well known and manifests e.g. in spacecharge limited emission described by the Child-Langmuir law or in the equilibrium current for field emission [1]. It is also known that spatial variation on emission characteristics of the cathode can lead to spatial variations in the current density that can affect the beam characteristics of a device [2]. These effects may often be readily understood using a continuous model for electrical current. In this work we look at discrete particle effects on electron emission, and introduce a region of influence within which a single electron strongly effects the local surface electric field of the cathode to such a degree that it greatly influences emission. We present some simple analytic models for estimating granularity of electron emission and compare to simulations. We investigate what implications this granularity may have on beam quality parameters such as emittance and brightness, and on current that may be drawn from electron sources with nanoscale features."

    "abstract": "Over the years, quartz has been sought for its beauty and versatility, yet people often mischaracterize it from other types of crystals. This study classifies three types of quartz: Rose, Clear, and Citrine, implementing Mask R-CNN (Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) to detect inclusions using a digital microscope with up to 1000x magnification. A Raspberry Pi 4 is used to process and analyze the captured images. Fluorescence UV light are utilized to highlight inclusions, while Microscopy will be used along with VGG-19 architecture serves as the second test to classify quartz based on extracted features. The system aims to enhance quartz classification accuracy, benefiting gemology, mineralogy, and the jewelry industry, while also laying a foundation for future machine learning-driven mineral identification studies."

    "abstract": "Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is a serious cancer with low survival rates due to late diagnosis and limited assessment tools. To address these issues, the Investigation of Head and Neck Cancer Margin Detection Through Hyperspectral Imaging Using Deep Learning (HNCMD) model is introduced, which combines hyperspectral imaging (HSI), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and ensemble learning for better tumor detection and margin assessment. This model was developed using surgical samples from 102 patients, resulting in 293 samples of tumor, margin, and healthy tissue. It identifies four key genes that help in diagnosis and treatment. The model processes hyperspectral data using an optimized CNN architecture, enhancing prediction accuracy through ensemble methods. The HNCMD system provides a non-invasive way to assess tumor margins quickly, improving diagnostic accuracy and supporting surgical decisions, with promising results in performance and automation."

The focus on low-power techniques has become a significant research area in real-time operating systems (RTOS). Among the strategies, Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS) and Dynamic Power Management (DPM) are commonly employed to decrease power consumption. To optimize energy usage during task scheduling on single-core processors with discrete frequencies, we introduce a Low Power Scheduling Algorithm for Segmented Frequency Scaling (LPSAFS), tailored for the RTOS periodic task model. LPSAFS effectively reduces the number of frequency scaling operations by strategically allocating minimal slack time to each task. The experimental results reveal that LPSAFS significantly conserves energy while maintaining system reliability within acceptable limits. In scenarios with high utilization, LPSAFS can achieve energy savings of up to 46 %."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed edge devices without sharing raw data, but real-world FL deployments face two key challenges: architectural heterogeneity among client models and non-IID data distributions. Traditional FL aggregation methods, such as FedAvg, assume model uniformity, leading to aggregation failures and degraded accuracy in heterogeneous environments, while existing personalized FL strategies lack client reliability assessment and dynamic adaptation. To address these limitations, we propose FlexiConfFed, a confidence-based adaptive aggregation framework for heterogeneous FL. FlexiConfFed introduces a multidimensional client confidence score, combining normalized accuracy, update magnitude, and gradient stability, to dynamically weight each client's contribution in the aggregation process. The framework also identifies common model layers among diverse architectures and applies a set of hierarchical confidence-weighted aggregation strategies, supporting both robust knowledge fusion and personalized adaptation. Extensive experiments on datasets including CIFAR-10, CINIC-10, and Speech Commands demonstrate that FlexiConfFed achieves up to 3% higher accuracy, faster convergence, and enhanced robustness over existing baselines, confirming its value as a scalable and efficient solution for FL under real-world heterogeneity."

Recognizing the need for robust action recognition in XR environments, we therefore present a flexible toolkit for real-time action recognition of virtual humans in XR environments. Our toolkit is built using Unity due to its widespread adoption and adaptability in XR/AR application development. The action recognition component leverages cutting-edge deep learning models to ensure high accuracy and performance and runs the analysis on a dedicated processing PC in order to not disrupt the smoothness of the XR experience.

    "abstract": "Nonlinear transmission lines (NLTLs) are under investigation as an alternative to Travelling Wave Tube Amplifiers (TWTAs) for producing high-power radiofrequency (RF) signals. NLTLs use passive components and provide a compact RF source; however, they require some conditions for operation. For example, capacitors must exhibit nonlinear behavior with voltage, and/or inductors must show nonlinearity with current. In addition to the nonlinear behavior of components, another critical parameter for this system is the line delay time, which depends on the number of sections, capacitance, and inductance. The primary challenge in generating RF signals using NLTLs is obtaining a fast rise-time pulse at the input. When the pulse rise time exceeds the line delay time, there is no RF generation. However, high-voltage (HV) sources with faster rise times of tens of ns are expensive. In this work, two schematic circuits as HV sources with fast rise times for NLTLs work as a solution. The first topology employs a driver (UCC37321) and an HV IGBT switch (IRG4PH40KD) to produce a negative pulse adjustable from 0 V to 1.2 kV (the maximum voltage supported by the IGBT), with a fall time on the order of 300 ns when using an NLTL as a load. The second circuit uses the same IGBT and driver. Still, it incorporates a high-speed optic coupler (model 6N137) to achieve galvanic insulation between the pulse generator and the power control (driver). This circuit improves the fall time to approximately 150 ns when using an NLTL as a load."

Due to their small size <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(&lt;5 \\text{mm})$</tex>, microplastics have been found in water and soil, leaving humans, animals–particularly aquatic life, and vegetation to uptake the carried contaminants. It is evident that a solution to this plastics problem, particularly microplastics in water, is required. A proposed solution is the use of non-thermal air plasma for the treatment of microplastics in water. Plasma, in water, acts as an advanced oxidation process, leading to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as OH radicals and O3. It is known that O2 plasma can decrease the contact angle of plastics, thus indicating an increase in hydrophilicity2. This allows the microplastics to disperse into the liquid phase, increasing contact with the ROS and, therefore, increasing the efficiency of the plasma treatment. To determine and quantify the effectiveness of O2 plasma pretreatment for microplastic degradation, pre-treated and control microplastics will be treated with air plasma and compared. The treated microplastic solutions will undergo GPC and ATR-FTIR analysis, to quantify average molecular weight changes and understand surface modifications to the microplastic surface. The gas and liquid phases will be analyzed using HPLC and GCMS to identify and quantify the formation of carbon products and quantify the effects of pre-treatment. The goal of this work is to quantify the effectiveness of O2 plasma pre-treatment on microplastic degradation."

However, in high-speed application scenarios, flat-plate permanent magnet electric suspension has high magnetic drag force and requires a large weight of the installed permanent magnets. To ameliorate these problems, this paper addresses the plate-type superconducting EDS system with a higher lift-to-drag ratio. First, the structure and principles of the superconducting EDS system are presented. Second, a three-dimensional analytical model of the electromagnetic force considering the transverse end effect is established by the magnetic vector potential equation and the boundary conditions at the end of the conductor plate. Among them, the source magnetic field of the superconducting magnets array required by the boundary conditions is solved by the coil discretization idea. Then, the reliability of the proposed analytical model is verified by comparing the computational results of the analytical model with the finite element simulation results. Finally, based on the three-dimensional analytical model, the suspension stiffness characteristics of the superconducting EDS system and the influence of specific parameters on the system's suspension performance are analyzed."

OpenMP, despite its popularity, poses challenges due to data-sharing and synchronization issues, making manual parallelization both time-consuming and prone to errors.

Recent advancements in large language models offer new opportunities for automation, with models like HPC-Coder demonstrating potential through fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning alone does not fully address the complexities of code comprehension. We introduce a novel agent that dynamically orchestrates static analysis tools to analyze code dependency and leverages in-context learning to generate OpenMP directives.

The proposed methodology establishes a universal set of common features across languages, making it adaptable to diverse linguistic backgrounds. It enables the classification of multiple disorders - including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Dysarthria, Hyperkinetic Dysarthria, Parkinson's Disease (PD), and Vox Senilis, based on shared acoustic features extracted from multilingual and imbalanced datasets. The proposed framework is evaluated on a combination of a self-collected Code-Mixed Children - Autism Spectrum Disorder (CoMiC-ASD) dataset and publicly available datasets.

High DF is desired for acoustic noise and reverberation suppression. However, this beamformer is very sensitive to array imperfections due to its low white noise gains (WNGs) at low frequencies of speech. Recently, a robust superdirective beamformer with a closed-form generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) structure has been proposed to achieve a tradeoff between the WNG and the DF via a rank-reduced blocking matrix of the GSC. In this paper, we propose a method to boost the robust superdirective beamformer based on two improvements: Firstly, we extend the robust superdirective beamformer to uniform circular arrays and leverage directional microphones to enhance the performance of superdirective beamformers; Secondly, we propose to design the blocking matrix via a particular differential beamforming method, i.e., circular differential directional microphone arrays. A comparative study shows that the proposed method brings about a noticeable improvement in WNG at the low frequencies (15 to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$20 \\text{d B}$</tex> at <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1 \\text{k H z}$</tex>) over the existing method, meanwhile enhancing the DF and exhibiting a more frequency-invariant beampattern."

Furthermore, the scarcity of large, annotated medical imaging datasets necessitates efficient learning techniques. By employing transfer learning, this study introduces NeuraVis, which demonstrates that high-performance classification (99.28% with MedViT) is achievable with a relatively small dataset, making it a viable solution in data-constrained environments.

    "abstract": "The evolutionary development has led to questions of security and trust in the increasingly popular use of AI-backed chatbots in digital communication platforms, especially in the emergence of malicious and adversarial bots. In this research, the suggested Explainable AI-Driven Anti-Chatbot Detection System would be able to control both robustness in detection and comprehensibility. The text normalization step together with the emoji-to-text mapping step are integrated to deal with informal and multilingual content, which enhances feature consistency. To increase efficiency and retain transparency, a SHAP-based Top-K feature selection strategy is used to find the most influential predictors. LightGBM classifier is used to detect and is implemented in a scalable, reproducible manner with scikit-learn pipelines. Sensitivity (96.8), specificity (95.4), and recall (97.1) are high and there is a very low false positive rate of 3.1%. In addition, the explainable framework offers insights that can be acted upon in classification decisions making the system more robust to trusting users. The proposed system solves the shortcomings of current methods, therefore, proving to be a guarantee in real-time secure communication against the changing chatbots."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the variance estimation method used in the variable-step-size shared-error normalized least mean square algorithm for the acoustic echo and noise canceller. The variance of the shared-error signal is typically estimated using a recursive equation, as this signal is readily available. In contrast, the disturbances of the acoustic echo canceller and adaptive noise canceller cannot be directly extracted from the microphone input, which contains both the desired signal and disturbances. Consequently, their variances are approximated by subtracting the correlated components from the variance of the shared-error signal. However, owing to misadjusted cross-correlation vectors, the variable-step-size parameters often become inappropriate. To address this, the scaling method for the cross-correlation vectors within the variance estimation is modified in this paper. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method improves stability during and after the double-talk period. Nevertheless, the update of the adaptive digital filters is continued under the double-talk period, degrading the overall echo and noise reduction performance."

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) offers potential solutions to security challenges. However, the significant redundancy in blockchain storage makes its implementation in IoV environments difficult. While numerous studies have addressed blockchain storage scalability, none of these solutions are directly applicable to the IoV. To tackle this issue, the present paper proposes a transaction pruning mechanism based on the directed acyclic graph lattice structure within the IoV. This mechanism takes into account the impact of transaction pruning on system security, transaction timeliness, and network resource usage. Given the highly dynamic nature of IoV, the paper employs a random selection-based hyper-heuristic algorithm to optimize the transaction pruning strategy. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms other optimization methods in terms of average target deviation, target variance, and success rate."

    "abstract": "This paper presents TAPA-ICL, a novel in-context learning (ICL) framework for few/zero-shot symbolic music understanding task that generates human-readable analysis. Conventional ICL approaches mainly rely on the ability of large language models (LLMs) to infer patterns and tasks from contextual examples. However, while LLMs have shown basic capability of understanding symbolic music, how to enhance such capability via additional context still remains unexplored. To tackle this issue, we focus on the two major challenges as follows: (1) Sparsity of Score Input through taxonomy-aware prompt augmentation (TAPA) that distills label-to-feature profiles, reducing context length by over 10 times; and (2) Complexity of Musical Semantics Reasoning via structured chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts enforcing feature extraction, context-aware analysis, and decisionmaking. By combining TAPA strategy and the CoT reasoning prompts, our method enables effective few/zero-shot adaptation across emotion recognition, composer identification, and genre classification tasks. Experimental results show that our TAPAICL method significantly outperforms conventional few-shot ICL baselines (including those based on ultra-large and mixture of experts (MoE) models) on each downstream task and achieves slightly weaker performance to existing many-shot approaches."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of deepfake technologies, AI-based detection systems have emerged as essential tools for verifying content authenticity across various domains, including journalism, social media, and digital forensics. However, existing research has primarily focused on adversarial attacks that manipulate input data or model architectures, while threats involving direct manipulation of a model's internal parameters have received comparatively little attention. This study presents a weight tampering attack scenario that targets MesoNet [1], a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for deepfake detection, by covertly modifying the weights of its internal Dense (fully connected) layers. Our experimental results demonstrate that, under conditions where the inputs remain visually indistinguishable (LPIPS = 0.0), the detection performance can degrade by up to 0.507, thereby disrupting the model's decision-making without altering the input image. In particular, dense layers adjacent to the final classification stage play a crucial role in interpreting high-level visual features such as texture, structure, and edges. Even minimal changes to the parameters in these layers can significantly distort the detection output, allowing visually normal images to evade detection or induce misclassification. Although demonstrated on Meso4, the proposed approach may be applicable to other CNN-based detectors with similar architectural traits. By empirically verifying the feasibility of silently undermining a detector's internal trust mechanism, this research highlights a structural vulnerability inherent in current deepfake detection systems. It further suggests that, to ensure the long-term robustness of AI-based detection systems, security design should move toward protecting and verifying internal parameters within tamper-resistant, isolated environments."

    "abstract": "Distributed multichannel active noise control (DMCANC) systems assign the high computational load of conventional centralized algorithms across multiple processing nodes, leveraging inter-node communication to collaboratively suppress unwanted noise. However, communication overhead can undermine algorithmic stability and degrade overall performance. To address this challenge, we propose a robust communication framework that integrates adaptive-fixed-filter switching and the mixed-gradient combination strategy. In this approach, each node independently executes a single-channel filtered reference least mean square (FxLMS) algorithm while monitoring real-time noise reduction levels. When the current noise reduction performance degrades compared to the previous state, the node halts its adaptive algorithm, switches to a fixed filter, and simultaneously initiates a communication request. The exchanged information comprises the difference between the current control filter and the filter at the time of the last communication, equivalent to the accumulated gradient sum during non-communication intervals. Upon receiving neighboring cumulative gradients, the node employs a mixed-gradient combination method to update its control filter, subsequently reverting to the adaptive mode. This proactive communication strategy and adaptive-fixed switching mechanism ensure system robustness by mitigating instability risks caused by communication issues. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves noise reduction performance comparable to centralized algorithms while maintaining stability under communication constraints, highlighting its practical applicability in real-world distributed ANC scenarios."

The diagnostic measures the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation from the probing gyrotron beam scattered by collective microscopic fluctuations in a plasma. Due to the presence of strong background electron cyclotron emission (ECE), detecting the weak spectral features of fast ions is challenging. To minimize background emission and enhance the sensitivity of the microwave receiver, the CTS diagnostic was upgraded to operate at a low-level ECE background between its second and third harmonics [1], [2]. Recent applications of the CTS diagnostic during experimental campaigns OP2.1 and OP2.2 at the W7-X stellarator confirmed reliable thermal ion measurements and showed the presence of fast ions during the operation of the neutral beam injection [3]. The fast ion detection results are currently under analysis. However, in certain plasma discharges, we observed signs of potential nonlinearities and saturation of the microwave receiver. This work focuses on identifying possible sources of the strong signals that interfere with the receiver operation and implementing countermeasures in its design. The operation of the probing gyrotron and its stray radiation, which can bypass front-end rejection filters in the radiometer, is analyzed. The updated radiometer is characterized in terms of linearity, dynamic range, and sensitivity. Test results are discussed and the limitations of the radiometer are defined."

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a sparse echo reconstruction method for micro-motion targets based on joint constraints of low-rank property and periodic consistency, aiming to enhance reconstruction performance. First, the wideband sparse echo signal model under random missing sampling (RMS) for micro-motion targets is established; then, inspired by the concept of matrix completion (MC), the “periodic consistency” constraint is introduced into the objective function, constructing an optimization model for echo signal reconstruction based on the low-rank property. Meanwhile, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) reconstructs echoes through alternate iterations and gradual optimization. Finally, simulation experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

    "abstract": "Wall climbing is a physically demanding sport that requires endurance and strength, particularly in the arms, shoulders, and core. It challenges the body’s ability to maintain strength and balance against gravity. Muscular endurance plays a crucial role in maintaining performance during prolonged climbing sessions, and climbers who engage in regular training experience muscle adaptations that enhance their endurance, strength, and overall performance. The Flexor Carpi Radialis (FCR) and Deltoideus (DEL) muscles, essential for wrist and arm movements, are key contributors to endurance in wall climbing. This study examines gender differences in muscle endurance and strength using surface electromyography (sEMG) to improve training, performance, and minimize injury risks. This study examined performance differences between males and females. Four participants (two males and two females, mean age 21.75 ± 2.63 years) climbed a 7A+ course while their muscle activity was analyzed using Mean Absolute Value (MAV) and Root Mean Square (RMS). The FCR and DEL muscles were evaluated for their role in wall climbing. Statistical analysis using ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD post-hoc test showed significant differences in muscle endurance between males and females, particularly in the RMS features of the DEL muscle (p = 0.004) and the Combined Muscle group (p = 0.029). These findings suggest that gender influences muscular endurance in wall climbing, with technique and experience also contributing to performance outcomes."

    "abstract": "Honey is the third-most adulterated food product in the world. Recently, AI-based hyperspectral detection has exhibited promising superiority in classifying pure and adulterated honey. However, the classification robustness of hyperspectral-based models has barely been assessed in existing studies, leading to the classification model being catastrophically “collapsed” under the attack of perturbations from honey adulteration. A trustworthy detective model is anticipated to classify the adulterated honey reliably, irrespective of perturbation attacks. In light of this, we propose a modeling strategy that views adulteration perturbations as variables. On top of that, accumulated negative log-likelihoods of conditional generative models are further wrapped with the Bayesian rule to certify the classification results, which improves classification robustness and accuracy of spectral detection models under attacks of adulteration perturbations. The results of empirical experiments imply that our proposed method successfully outperforms the state-of-the-art in applying hyperspectral techniques to classify the authenticity of honey. The precision score is still averagely over 85 % for classifying adulterated honey when adulteration concentrations are shifted, and the recall score is over 85 % when unobserved honey types attack. Consequently, our findings are eligible to serve as a potential way to improve the robustness and accuracy of hyperspectral detection models against food fraud."

Rather than simply visualizing the literal content of the lyrics, the selected segments aim to convey scenes and atmospheres inferred through a deeper interpretation of their meaning. In the proposed approach, a large language model is first used to interpret the lyrics in terms of multiple attributes, such as characters, season, time of day, weather, location, and mood. These interpretations then serve as queries for moment retrieval, enabling the extraction of relevant video segments. To further optimize the composition of segments assigned to each part of the song (e.g., verse, bridge, chorus), a re-ranking step based on a second round of moment retrieval is applied to the initial retrieval results, ensuring global consistency across the final background video. The effectiveness of the proposed automatic video selection method based on lyric interpretation is validated through a subjective evaluation experiment comparing the generated videos with those used in actual karaoke systems."

    "abstract": "High-resolution inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging technology is a key method for achieving situational awareness and precise recognition of high-speed moving targets. However, the high-speed movement of targets can cause intra-pulse and inter-pulse translational motion errors, resulting in severe defocusing of ISAR images. To address this issue, this paper proposes an algorithm for high-resolution ISAR imaging of highspeed targets via joint intra-pulse and inter-pulse translational motion compensation (JIPMC). This algorithm utilizes an improved matched filter to achieve precise pulse compression, effectively eliminating intra-pulse motion errors. Based on the homogeneity of intra-pulse and inter-pulse translational motion errors, this paper constructs an intra-pulse and inter-pulse translational motion error model. Combined with optimal parameter estimation, it achieves joint correction of intra-pulse and inter-pulse translational motion errors. The proposed algorithm avoids the cascaded processing of intra-pulse motion compensation (IPMC), envelope alignment, and initial phase correction, significantly reducing error propagation and improving the accuracy and robustness of motion compensation. For optimal parameter estimation, the proposed algorithm utilizes the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to solve the optimization problem under the minimum entropy criterion. The ABC algorithm combines global search and local optimization capabilities, thereby effectively guaranteeing the global optimality of the solution. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method for high-resolution ISAR imaging of high-speed targets."
