    "abstract": "Evaluating the robustness of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) is essential for their continued development and responsible deployment in real-world applications. However, existing robustness benchmarks typically focus on hallucination or misleading textual inputs, while largely overlooking the equally critical challenge posed by misleading visual inputs in assessing visual understanding. To fill this important gap, we introduce MVI-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating how Misleading Visual Inputs undermine the robustness of LVLMs. Grounded in fundamental visual primitives, the design of MVI-Bench centers on three hierarchical levels of misleading visual inputs: Visual Concept, Visual Attribute, and Visual Relationship. Using this taxonomy, we curate six representative categories and compile 1,248 expertly annotated VQA instances. To facilitate fine-grained robustness evaluation, we further introduce MVI-Sensitivity, a novel metric that characterizes LVLM robustness at a granular level. Empirical results across 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs uncover pronounced vulnerabilities to misleading visual inputs, and our in-depth analyses on MVI-Bench provide actionable insights that can guide the development of more reliable and robust LVLMs. The benchmark and codebase can be accessed at https://github.com/chenyil6/MVI-Bench."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "Multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) methods, which integrate multiple visual modalities, often suffer even more severe performance degradation than unimodal FAS when deployed in unseen domains. This is mainly due to two overlooked risks that affect cross-domain multimodal generalization. The first is the modal representation invariant risk, i.e., whether representations remain generalizable under domain shift. We theoretically show that the inherent class asymmetry in FAS (diverse spoofs vs. compact reals) enlarges the upper bound of generalization error, and this effect is further amplified in multimodal settings. The second is the modal synergy invariant risk, where models overfit to domain-specific inter-modal correlations. Such spurious synergy cannot generalize to unseen attacks in target domains, leading to performance drops. To solve these issues, we propose a provable framework, namely Multimodal Representation and Synergy Invariance Learning (RiSe). For representation risk, RiSe introduces Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM), which learns an invariant spherical decision boundary in radial space to fit asymmetric distributions, while preserving domain cues in angular space. For synergy risk, RiSe employs Multimodal Synergy Disentanglement (MMSD), a self-supervised task enhancing intrinsic, generalizable modal features via cross-sample mixing and disentanglement. Theoretical analysis and experiments verify RiSe, which achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain performance."

    "abstract": "In computational anatomy, the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) framework has become a central tool for modeling smooth, invertible transformations between shapes such as curves or landmarks. In this paper, we extend this framework by enriching diffeomorphic deformations with transformations induced by finite-dimensional Lie groups (e.g. isometries, scalings), and we develop a registration model that decouples the actions of these two types of deformation on the shape during the matching process. To achieve this, we consider semidirect products between finite-dimensional groups and groups of diffeomorphisms, endowed with a right-invariant sub-Riemannian structure that give rise to new variational problems for shape registration. By exploiting symmetries and reduction theory, we decouple the contributions of each group throughout the matching process. We further extend the framework to incoroporate anisotropic deformations that preferentially favor certain directions during registration. On the numerical side, we propose an algorithm based on a joint optimization over both deformation groups, in contrast to the standard twostage approach that optimizes first over the finite-dimensional component and then over the diffeomorphic one. Experiments on curves and landmarks demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization improves registration accuracy and more effectively disentangles the contributions of the two deformation groups."

    "abstract": "The shift from Convolutional Neural Networks to Transformers has reshaped computer vision, yet these two architectural families are typically viewed as fundamentally distinct. We argue that convolution and self-attention, despite their apparent differences, can be unified within a single k-nearest neighbor aggregation framework. The critical insight is that both operations are special cases of neighbor selection and aggregation; convolution selects neighbors by spatial proximity, while attention selects by feature similarity, revealing they exist on a continuous spectrum. We introduce Convolutional Nearest Neighbors (ConvNN), a unified framework that formalizes this connection. Crucially, ConvNN serves as a drop-in replacement for convolutional and attention layers, enabling systematic exploration of the intermediate spectrum between these two extremes. We validate the framework's coherence on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification tasks across two complementary architectures: (1) Hybrid branching in VGG improves accuracy on both CIFAR datasets by combining spatial-proximity and feature-similarity selection; and (2) ConvNN in ViT outperforms standard attention and other attention variants on both datasets. Extensive ablations on $k$ values and architectural variants reveal that interpolating along this spectrum provides regularization benefits by balancing local and global receptive fields. Our work provides a unifying framework that dissolves the apparent distinction between convolution and attention, with implications for designing more principled and interpretable vision architectures."

    "abstract": "High-order nodal space-time flux reconstruction (STFR) methods have been developed to solve hyperbolic conservation laws on curvilinear moving grids. Unlike the method-of-lines approach for moving domain simulation, the grid velocity is implicitly embedded into the curvilinear geometric representation of space-time elements. Several key issues in moving domain simulation, including the discrete geometric conservation law (GCL), solution and flux approximation, and aliasing error control, are discussed in the context of the nodal STFR framework. Conditions and the corresponding numerical strategies to reduce aliasing errors due to the curvilinear space-time representation of moving domain problems, including the discrete GCL errors (i.e. one type of aliasing errors in the space-time framework), are then explained and examined. Since a space-time tensor product is used to construct the FR formulation in this study, all space-time schemes show the temporal superconvergence property, similar to that presented by the implicit Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (IRK-DG) schemes, in moving domain simulation. Specifically, a nominal $k$th order scheme can achieve a ($2k-1$)th order superconvergence rate when solutions on $k$ Gauss-Legendre points are used to construct polynomials in the time dimension. The robustness of temporal superconvergence in the existence of aliasing errors induced by the curvilinear space-time representation, and upon de-aliasing operations based on polynomial filtering, has been examined with numerical experiments."

For general n-ary operations, we define (n,m)-type ideals and establish diagonal criteria for n-ary primeness and semiprimeness. A unified radical theory and a Zariski-type spectral topology are then formulated, connecting primitive ideals with simple module representations. The results culminate in a noncommutative Wedderburn-Artin-type decomposition, revealing a triadic spectral geometry that unifies commutative, noncommutative, and higher-arity cases"

Yet, current-generation EMS infrastructure remains constrained by one-to-one video streaming and limited analytics capabilities, leaving dispatchers and EMTs to manually interpret overwhelming, often noisy or redundant information in high-stress environments. We present TeleEMS, a mobile live video analytics system that enables pre-arrival multimodal inference by fusing audio and video into a unified decision-making pipeline before EMTs arrive on scene. TeleEMS comprises two key components: TeleEMS Client and TeleEMS Server. The TeleEMS Client runs across phones, smart glasses, and desktops to support bystanders, EMTs en route, and 911 dispatchers. The TeleEMS Server, deployed at the edge, integrates EMS-Stream, a communication backbone that enables smooth multi-party video streaming. On top of EMSStream, the server hosts three real-time analytics modules: (1) audio-to-symptom analytics via EMSLlama, a domain-specialized LLM for robust symptom extraction and normalization; (2) video-to-vital analytics using state-of-the-art rPPG methods for heart rate estimation; and (3) joint text-vital analytics via PreNet, a multimodal multitask model predicting EMS protocols, medication types, medication quantities, and procedures. Evaluation shows that EMSLlama outperforms GPT-4o (exact-match 0.89 vs. 0.57) and that text-vital fusion improves inference robustness, enabling reliable pre-arrival intervention recommendations. TeleEMS demonstrates the potential of mobile live video analytics to transform EMS operations, bridging the gap between bystanders, dispatchers, and EMTs, and paving the way for next-generation intelligent EMS infrastructure."

    "abstract": "Mysophobia, or the fear of germs, is a prevalent anxiety disorder that significantly impacts daily life. This study investigates the potential of a gamified virtual reality (VR) intervention to simulate contamination-related scenarios and assess their emotional and psychological effects. A VR game based sneeze simulation was developed to evaluate its influence on participants' emotional states. Seven participants completed two versions of the game: a baseline version and an experimental version featuring the sneeze simulation. Emotional responses were measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - State (STAI-S) questionnaires. The results revealed slight increases in negative affect and anxiety levels during the sneeze simulation. Also, a reduction in positive affect was revealed. However, these differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). This is likely due to small sample sizes, a lack of grossness in the simulation, or participants not being clinically mysophobes. This exploratory study highlights the potential of VR-based interventions for understanding and addressing contamination-related anxieties. It provides a foundation for future research with larger and more diverse participant pools."

Standard practice collapses these label distributions into single labels, aggregating diverse human judgments into point estimates. We argue that this approach is epistemically misaligned for ambiguous data--the annotation distribution itself should be regarded as the ground truth. Training on collapsed single labels forces models to express false confidence on fundamentally ambiguous cases, creating a misalignment between model certainty and the diversity of human perception. We demonstrate empirically that soft-label training, which treats annotation distributions as ground truth, preserves epistemic uncertainty. Across both vision and NLP tasks, soft-label training achieves 32% lower KL divergence from human annotations and 61% stronger correlation between model and annotation entropy, while matching the accuracy of hard-label training. Our work repositions annotation distributions from noisy signals to be aggregated away, to faithful representations of epistemic uncertainty that models should learn to reproduce."

We show that the entanglement asymmetry of a local subsystem exhibits nonanalytic dependence on the energy imbalance, due to the presence of Dirac points in the Brillouin zone. We also study the quench dynamics from the ground state into the inversion-symmetric point at which the energy imbalance vanishes. Under certain conditions on the subsystem geometry, the entanglement asymmetry relaxes to a finite value after the quench, revealing that the inversion-symmetry breaking in the initial ground state can persist even under the symmetric dynamics. We attribute the absence of symmetry restoration to the presence of a flat energy dispersion (flat band) in a specific direction."

We propose an asymmetric aggregation VPR method with geometric constraints for locally aggregated descriptors, called $A^2$GC-VPR. Our method employs row-column normalization averaging with separate marginal calibration, enabling asymmetric matching that adapts to distributional discrepancies in visual place recognition. Geometric constraints are incorporated through learnable coordinate embeddings, computing compatibility scores fused with feature similarities, thereby promoting spatially proximal features to the same cluster and enhancing spatial awareness. Experimental results on MSLS, NordLand, and Pittsburgh datasets demonstrate superior performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach in improving matching accuracy and robustness."

Several $J/ψ$ production mechanisms are considered: the leading-order non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) color-singlet and color-octet contributions, the cluster collapse mechanism, and the non-prompt $J/ψ$ from $b$-hadron decays. The simulated inclusive $J/ψ$ transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) differential cross sections agree well with the experimental data at both the middle and forward rapidities. For the $J/ψ$ yield, the dominant contribution comes from the NRQCD channel, while the cluster collapse and non-prompt processes provide relatively minor contributions. A decomposition of the NRQCD component, comprising direct production from the parton hard scattering and feed-down from $ψ(2S)$, $χ_{c0}$, $χ_{c1}$, and $χ_{c2}$, reveals that at low (high) $p_{\\rm T}$ the dominant contributions come from the direct production and $χ_{c2}$ ($χ_{c1}$) feed-down. The $ψ(2S)$ feed-down fraction is 8-9$\\%$, while the $χ_{c0}$ contribution is around 2-3$\\%$. The influence of the partonic and hadronic rescatterings is also examined. The partonic rescattering exhibits negligible impact on the $J/ψ$ yields across all production mechanisms. In contrast, the hadronic rescattering suppresses the $J/ψ$ productions from both the NRQCD and cluster collapse mechanisms, while leaving the non-prompt $J/ψ$ yield almost unaffected."

Due to significant differences in viewpoint and scale, coupled with complex background interference, traditional multi-stage \"retrieval-matching\" pipelines are prone to cumulative errors. To address this, we present SMGeo, a promptable end-to-end transformer-based model for object Geo-localization. This model supports click prompting and can output object Geo-localization in real time when prompted to allow for interactive use. The model employs a fully transformer-based architecture, utilizing a Swin-Transformer for joint feature encoding of both drone and satellite imagery and an anchor-free transformer detection head for coordinate regression. In order to better capture both inter-modal and intra-view dependencies, we introduce a grid-level sparse Mixture-of-Experts (GMoE) into the cross-view encoder, allowing it to adaptively activate specialized experts according to the content, scale and source of each grid. We also employ an anchor-free detection head for coordinate regression, directly predicting object locations via heat-map supervision in the reference images. This approach avoids scale bias and matching complexity introduced by predefined anchor boxes. On the drone-to-satellite task, SMGeo achieves leading performance in accuracy at IoU=0.25 and mIoU metrics (e.g., 87.51%, 62.50%, and 61.45% in the test set, respectively), significantly outperforming representative methods such as DetGeo (61.97%, 57.66%, and 54.05%, respectively).

    "abstract": "Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become a mainstream approach for simultaneously improving prompt fidelity and generation quality in conditional generative models. During training, CFG stochastically alternates between conditional and null prompts to enable both conditional and unconditional generation. However, during sampling, CFG outputs both null and conditional prompts simultaneously, leading to inconsistent noise estimates between the training and sampling processes. To reduce this error, we propose CFG-EC, a versatile correction scheme augmentable to any CFG-based method by refining the unconditional noise predictions. CFG-EC actively realigns the unconditional noise error component to be orthogonal to the conditional error component. This corrective maneuver prevents interference between the two guidance components, thereby constraining the sampling error's upper bound and establishing more reliable guidance trajectories for high-fidelity image generation. Our numerical experiments show that CFG-EC handles the unconditional component more effectively than CFG and CFG++, delivering a marked performance increase in the low guidance sampling regime and consistently higher prompt alignment across the board."

To address this, we constructed a balanced multi-label sentiment dataset by integrating the original GoEmotions data, emotion-labeled samples from Sentiment140 using a RoBERTa-base-GoEmotions model, and manually annotated texts generated by GPT-4 mini. Our data balancing strategy ensured an even distribution across 28 emotion categories. Based on this dataset, we developed an enhanced multi-label classification model that combines pre-trained FastText embeddings, convolutional layers for local feature extraction, bidirectional LSTM for contextual learning, and an attention mechanism to highlight sentiment-relevant words. A sigmoid-activated output layer enables multi-label prediction, and mixed precision training improves computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC compared to models trained on imbalanced data, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach."

    "abstract": "Hierarchical LiDAR geometry compression encodes voxel occupancies from low to high bit-depths, yet prior methods treat each depth independently and re-estimate local context from coordinates at every level, limiting compression efficiency. We present ELiC, a real-time framework that combines cross-bit-depth feature propagation, a Bag-of-Encoders (BoE) selection scheme, and a Morton-order-preserving hierarchy. Cross-bit-depth propagation reuses features extracted at denser, lower depths to support prediction at sparser, higher depths. BoE selects, per depth, the most suitable coding network from a small pool, adapting capacity to observed occupancy statistics without training a separate model for each level. The Morton hierarchy maintains global Z-order across depth transitions, eliminating per-level sorting and reducing latency. Together these components improve entropy modeling and computation efficiency, yielding state-of-the-art compression at real-time throughput on Ford and SemanticKITTI. Code and models will be released upon publication."

    "abstract": "Strong isolation guarantees, such as serializability and snapshot isolation, are essential for maintaining data consistency and integrity in modern databases. Verifying whether a database upholds its claimed guarantees is increasingly critical, as these guarantees form a contract between the vendor and its users. However, this task is challenging, particularly in black-box settings, where only observable system behavior is available and often involves uncertain dependencies between transactions. In this paper, we present VeriStrong, a fast verifier for strong database isolation. At its core is a novel formalism called hyper-polygraphs, which compactly captures both certain and uncertain transactional dependencies in database executions. Leveraging this formalism, we develop sound and complete encodings for verifying both serializability and snapshot isolation. To achieve high efficiency, VeriStrong tailors SMT solving to the characteristics of database workloads, in contrast to prior general-purpose approaches. Our extensive evaluation across diverse benchmarks shows that VeriStrong not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art verifiers on the workloads they support, but also scales to large, general workloads beyond their reach, while maintaining high accuracy in detecting isolation anomalies."

    "abstract": "Medication recommendation systems play a crucial role in assisting clinicians with personalized treatment decisions. While existing approaches have made significant progress in learning medication representations, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) treating medical entities as independent features without modeling their synergistic effects on medication selection; (ii) employing static causal relationships that fail to adapt to patient-specific contexts and health states. To address these challenges, we propose CafeMed, a framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention for safe and accurate medication recommendation. CafeMed introduces two key components: the Causal Weight Generator (CWG) that transforms static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights based on individual patient states, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) that captures complex interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures. This design enables CafeMed to model how different medical conditions jointly influence treatment decisions while maintaining medication safety constraints. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that CafeMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in medication prediction while maintaining the lower drug--drug interaction rates. Our results indicate that incorporating dynamic causal relationships and cross-modal synergies leads to more clinically-aligned and personalized medication recommendations.

    "abstract": "Log anomaly detection, which is critical for identifying system failures and preempting security breaches, detects irregular patterns within large volumes of log data, and impacts domains such as service reliability, performance optimization, and database log analysis. Modern log anomaly detection methods rely on training deep learning models on clean, anomaly-free log sequences. However, obtaining such clean log data requires costly and tedious human labeling, and existing automatic cleaning methods fail to fully integrate the specific characteristics and actual semantics of logs in their purification process. In this paper, we propose a cost-aware, rule-enhanced purification framework, LogPurge, that automatically selects a sufficient subset of normal log sequences from contamination log sequences to train a anomaly detection model. Our approach involves a two-stage filtering algorithm: In the first stage, we use a large language model (LLM) to remove clustered anomalous patterns and enhance system rules to improve LLM's understanding of system logs; in the second stage, we utilize a divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the remaining contaminated regions into smaller subproblems, allowing each to be effectively purified through the first stage procedure. Our experiments, conducted on two public datasets and one industrial dataset, show that our method significantly removes an average of 98.74% of anomalies while retaining 82.39% of normal samples. Compared to the latest unsupervised log sample selection algorithms, our method achieves F-1 score improvements of 35.7% and 84.11% on the public datasets, and an impressive 149.72% F-1 improvement on the private dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach."

We develop a conditional generative framework that maps a label (a vector of partial observations) to an ensemble of plausible aerosol states and propagates these to diagnostics, yielding mean estimates with confidence intervals. Using synthetic data, we evaluate two label configurations: a low-dimensional setup with limited number distribution and bulk-composition information, and a high-dimensional setup including complete number and total mass distributions plus species bulk masses. Generated samples maintain strong label compliance, and higher-dimensional labels markedly reduce variability. CCN activity and volume scattering are well constrained even under the low-dimensional setup, whereas dust- and BC-sensitive diagnostics (frozen fraction, absorption) benefit substantially from the additional information in the high-dimensional case. This framework clarifies which observational inputs most effectively constrain different diagnostics and demonstrates how generative machine learning can provide uncertainty-aware estimates from incomplete aerosol information."

This paper introduces SmallML, a Bayesian transfer learning framework achieving enterprise-level prediction accuracy with datasets as small as 50-200 observations. We develop a three-layer architecture integrating transfer learning, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, and conformal prediction. Layer 1 extracts informative priors from 22,673 public records using a SHAP-based procedure transferring knowledge from gradient boosting to logistic regression. Layer 2 implements hierarchical pooling across J=5-50 SMEs with adaptive shrinkage, balancing population patterns with entity-specific characteristics. Layer 3 provides conformal sets with finite-sample coverage guarantees P(y in C(x)) >= 1-alpha for distribution-free uncertainty quantification. Validation on customer churn data demonstrates 96.7% +/- 4.2% AUC with 100 observations per business -- a +24.2 point improvement over independent logistic regression (72.5% +/- 8.1%), with p < 0.000001. Conformal prediction achieves 92% empirical coverage at 90% target. Training completes in 33 minutes on standard CPU hardware. By enabling enterprise-grade predictions for 33 million U.S. SMEs previously excluded from machine learning, SmallML addresses a critical gap in AI democratization.

    "abstract": "Membership inference attacks (MIAs) on large language models (LLMs) pose significant privacy risks across various stages of model training. Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have brought a profound paradigm shift in LLM training, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. However, the on-policy nature of RLVR introduces a unique privacy leakage pattern: since training relies on self-generated responses without fixed ground-truth outputs, membership inference must now determine whether a given prompt (independent of any specific response) is used during fine-tuning. This creates a threat where leakage arises not from answer memorization. To audit this novel privacy risk, we propose Divergence-in-Behavior Attack (DIBA), the first membership inference framework specifically designed for RLVR. DIBA shifts the focus from memorization to behavioral change, leveraging measurable shifts in model behavior across two axes: advantage-side improvement (e.g., correctness gain) and logit-side divergence (e.g., policy drift). Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate that DIBA significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving around 0.8 AUC and an order-of-magnitude higher TPR@0.1%FPR. We validate DIBA's superiority across multiple settings--including in-distribution, cross-dataset, cross-algorithm, black-box scenarios, and extensions to vision-language models. Furthermore, our attack remains robust under moderate defensive measures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically analyze privacy vulnerabilities in RLVR, revealing that even in the absence of explicit supervision, training data exposure can be reliably inferred through behavioral traces."

The system implements a Router-Planner-Coordinator workflow and an optional Evaluator role, using prompt-engineered agents coordinated via LangGraph's StateGraph and supported by helper agents such as a Researcher. Each role is defined through custom system prompts that enforce structured JSON outputs. A hybrid memory approach (FAISS + SQLite) enables both semantic retrieval and structured conversation history. An incremental indexing strategy based on file hashing minimizes redundant re-embedding when scientific corpora evolve. A configuration-driven project bootstrap layer allows research teams to customize tools, prompts, and data sources without modifying core code. All agent decisions, tool invocations, and retrievals are logged and visualized through a custom Gradio interface, providing step-by-step transparency for each reasoning episode.

Fitting splat models reduces to optimization over the space of mixing measures, which can be implemented using Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao gradient flows. As a byproduct, we recover the popular Gaussian Splatting methodology as a special case, providing a unified theoretical framework for this state-of-the-art technique that clearly disambiguates the inverse problem, the model, and the optimization algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting models and algorithms constitute a flexible and promising approach for solving diverse approximation, estimation, and inverse problems involving low-dimensional data."

    "abstract": "The Moon-forming giant impact significantly influenced the initial thermal state of Earth's mantle by generating a global magma ocean, marking the onset of mantle evolution. Recent Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations indicate that such a collision would produce a superheated core, whose cooling would strongly influence subsequent mantle dynamics. Here, we present systematic SPH simulations of diverse giant-impact scenarios and show that the superheated core formed after the impact can trigger secondary mantle melting, thereby governing the final state of the magma ocean. To further quantify this effect, we employ a parameterized mantle-melting model to evaluate the influence of secondary melting on the lower mantle. Our results suggest three possible outcomes: complete mantle melting, the formation of a basal melt layer, or the initiation of an early superplume. Combined with recent two-phase magma-ocean solidification models, we infer that all three scenarios would result in basal melt layers of varying thickness, partially retaining the thermal energy of the superheated core. In the canonical Moon-forming scenario, the superheated core would rapidly transfer heat to Earth's lower mantle, causing secondary mantle melting within approximately 277--5983 years and generating either a basal melt layer or a fully molten mantle. Both outcomes would effectively erase primordial heterogeneities in the lower mantle and impose distinct pathways for its subsequent thermal evolution."

This approach enables detailed examination of key plasma processes governing beam neutralization and wall interactions under ground-test conditions. We find that inelastic electron cooling is essential for achieving a physically consistent, neutralized beam. Increasing the background pressure enhances ion-neutral collisions, leading to more charge- and momentum-exchange events that reduce ion mean energies, broaden the beam, and increase sidewall losses. Including inelastic processes flattens the potential, sustains quasi-neutrality, and preserves beam collimation farther downstream. Single-particle trajectory analyses show that primary electrons undergo mixed escape and temporary trapping, while low energy post-inelastic electrons remain confined, sustaining the neutralization cloud. Sheath diagnostics reveal that at the beam dump, classical Child-Langmuir and Hutchinson models underpredict the sheath length due to residual electrons, while near the sidewall, the sheath is truncated by beam-sheath interference within the compact domain. Current-flow analysis indicates that higher background pressure conditions yield lower beam energies and increased sidewall currents."

Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic models generate high-resolution flood maps using numerical methods requiring fine-grid discretization; which are computationally intensive and impractical for real-time large-scale applications.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models to perform super-resolution on coarse-grid flood maps, with the objective of achieving the accuracy of fine-grid flood maps while significantly reducing inference time. Experimental results demonstrate that latent diffusion models substantially decrease the computational time required to produce high-fidelity flood maps without compromising on accuracy, enabling their use in real-time flood risk management. Moreover, diffusion models exhibit superior generalizability across different physical locations, with transfer learning further accelerating adaptation to new geographic regions.

To address this, we investigate the production of four such states ($η_2(4D)$, $η'_2(2D)$, $η'_2(3D)$, and $η'_2(4D)$) employing an effective Lagrangian approach combined with Regge trajectory phenomenology to describe the high-energy behavior of the reactions. Our calculations reveal a distinct production selectivity: the $η_2(4D)$ state is more prominent in pion induced ($π^- p \\to η_2 n$) reactions, whereas the $η'_2(2D, 3D, 4D)$ states are preferentially produced in kaon induced ($K^- p \\to η_2 Λ$) processes. Moreover, the total cross sections for these states exhibit characteristic peaks at specific beam momenta, providing clear kinematic windows for their discovery. This study provides the first comprehensive theoretical predictions for the production cross sections of these predicted mesons, offering crucial guidance for future experimental searches."

CI methods fail to leverage the potential insights from inter-channel interactions, resulting in models that may not fully exploit the underlying statistical dependencies present in the data. Conversely, CD approaches often incorporate too much extraneous information, risking model overfitting and predictive inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce the Adaptive Forecasting Transformer (\\textbf{Adapformer}), an advanced Transformer-based framework that merges the benefits of CI and CD methodologies through effective channel management. The core of Adapformer lies in its dual-stage encoder-decoder architecture, which includes the \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{C}hannel \\textbf{E}nhancer (\\textbf{ACE}) for enriching embedding processes and the \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{C}hannel \\textbf{F}orecaster (\\textbf{ACF}) for refining the predictions. ACE enhances token representations by selectively incorporating essential dependencies, while ACF streamlines the decoding process by focusing on the most relevant covariates, substantially reducing noise and redundancy. Our rigorous testing on diverse datasets shows that Adapformer achieves superior performance over existing models, enhancing both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, thus making it state-of-the-art in MTSF."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of smart technologies and evolving privacy regulations such as the GDPR and CPRA has increased the need to manage fine-grained access control (FGAC) policies in database management systems (DBMSs). Existing approaches to enforcing FGAC policies do not scale to thousands of policies, leading to degraded query performance and reduced system effectiveness. We present Sieve, a middleware for relational DBMSs that combines query rewriting and caching to optimize FGAC policy enforcement. Sieve rewrites a query with guarded expressions that group and filter policies and can efficiently use indexes in the DBMS. It also integrates a caching mechanism with an effective replacement strategy and a refresh mechanism to adapt to dynamic workloads. Experiments on two DBMSs with real and synthetic datasets show that Sieve scales to large datasets and policy corpora, maintaining low query latency and system load and improving policy evaluation performance by between 2x and 10x on workloads with 200 to 1,200 policies. The caching extension further improves query performance by between 6 and 22 percent under dynamic workloads, especially with larger cache sizes. These results highlight Sieve's applicability for real-time access control in smart environments and its support for efficient, scalable management of user preferences and privacy policies."

    "abstract": "We give noise-robust, Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) guarantees of global $\\varepsilon$-optimality for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver under explicit geometric conditions. For periodic ansatzes with bounded generators -- yielding a globally Lipschitz cost landscape on a toroidal parameter space -- we assume that the low-energy region containing the global minimum is a Morse--Bott submanifold whose normal Hessian has rank $r = O(\\log p)$ for $p$ parameters, and which satisfies polynomial fiber regularity with respect to coordinate-aligned, embedded flats. This low-curvature-dimensional structure serves as a model for regimes in which only a small number of directions control energy variation, and is consistent with mechanisms such as strong parameter tying together with locality in specific multiscale and tied shallow architectures. Under this assumption, the sample complexity required to find an $\\varepsilon$-optimal region with confidence $1-δ$ scales with the curvature dimension $r$ rather than the ambient dimension $p$. With probability at least $1-δ$, the algorithm outputs a region in which all points are $\\varepsilon$-optimal, and at least one lies within a bounded neighborhood of the global minimum. The resulting complexity is quasi-polynomial in $p$ and $\\varepsilon^{-1}$ and logarithmic in $δ^{-1}$. This identifies a geometric regime in which high-probability global optimization remains feasible despite shot noise."

At its core, an alternating architecture decouples the optimization by parameterizing the state, adjoint and topology fields with three distinct Fourier Neural Networks (FNNs). These networks are trained through a collaborative and stable alternating optimization scheme applicable to both self-adjoint and non-self-adjoint systems. The Ginzburg-Landau energy functional is incorporated into the topology network's loss function, acting as an intrinsic regularizer that promotes well-defined designs with smooth and distinct interfaces. By employing physics-informed losses derived from either variational principles or strong-form PDE residuals, the broad applicability of the APF-FNNs is demonstrated across a spectrum of 2D and 3D multi-physics benchmarks, including compliance minimization, eigenvalue maximization, and Stokes/Navier-Stokes flow optimization. The proposed APF-FNNs consistently yield high-performance and high-resolution topologies, establishing a powerful and versatile foundation for physics-driven computational design."

The corresponding permanent magnetization is a function of the baryonic chemical potential $μ$, decreasing up to zero as $μ$ increases in the range of intermediate densities ($312$ MeV $\\leqslant μ\\leqslant 342$ MeV) and then increasing from zero in the higher density interval $490$ MeV$\\leqslant μ\\leqslant 550$ MeV. We will show that this system's ability to generate permanent magnetization, together with the existence of the axial anomaly, open up the possibility of spontaneously generating a magnetic field coupled to a collinear electric field. The generated magnetic field can reach values up to $10^{16}$ G, depending on $μ$, and the electric field will be 3 orders smaller. The fact that the DCDW phase is able to induce a magnetic field can be seen as its spontaneous tendency to remove the so called Landau-Peierls instability that is present in this single-modulated phase in the absence of a magnetic field. The spontaneous induction of a strong magnetic field at intermediate to high densities can be of interest for the astrophysics of compact stellar objects exhibiting strong magnetic fields as magnetars."

While tabular predictors provide robust markers of global risk, their ability to capture subtle brain changes remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the predictive contributions of tabular and imaging-based representations, with a focus on transformer-derived Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) embeddings. We introduce a trajectory-aware labeling strategy based on Dynamic Time Warping clustering to capture heterogeneous patterns of cognitive change, and train a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized and augmented MRI data to obtain anatomy-preserving embeddings without progression labels. The pretrained encoder embeddings are subsequently assessed using both traditional machine learning classifiers and deep learning heads, and compared against tabular representations and convolutional network baselines. Results highlight complementary strengths across modalities. Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs of around 0.70 for predicting mild and severe progression, underscoring their utility in capturing global decline trajectories. In contrast, MRI embeddings from the ViT model were most effective in distinguishing cognitively stable individuals with an AUC of 0.71. However, all approaches struggled in the heterogeneous moderate group. These findings indicate that clinical features excel in identifying high-risk extremes, whereas transformer-based MRI embeddings are more sensitive to subtle markers of stability, motivating multimodal fusion strategies for AD progression modeling."

While recent approaches have explored episodic memory (Reflexion), gradient-based prompt optimization (TextGrad),and hierarchical task decomposition independently, their potential for synergistic integration remains unexplored. We introduce ReflexGrad, a novel architecture that tightly couples three complementary mechanisms: (1) LLM-based hierarchical TODO decomposition for strategic planning, (2) history-aware causal reflection that analyzes recent action patterns to identify failure root causes and enable within-trial learning, and (3) gradient-based optimization for systematic improvement. Unlike prior work relying on few-shot demonstrations, our system achieves true zero-shot generalization through pure LLM semantic reasoning,requiring no task-specific examples, fine-tuning, or hardcoded similarity metrics. Evaluated on ALFWorld benchmark tasks, ReflexGrad demonstrates 67% zero-shot success rate on Trial 0 without any prior task experience or demonstrations, establishing effective performance on first exposure. Through empirical analysis, we identify the architectural mechanisms underlying stable convergence (zero action loops) and effective cross-task transfer (67% to 78% improvement).Our work demonstrates that synergistic integration of complementary learning mechanisms enables robust zero-shot generalization that approaches few-shot baselines from prior work."

Recent advances have demonstrated that SGS models trained via ``online'' end-to-end learning -- where the dynamical solver operating on the filtered equations participates in the training -- can outperform traditional physics-based approaches. Most studies, however, have focused on idealised periodic domains, neglecting the mechanical boundaries present e.g. in planetary interiors. To address this issue, we consider two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulent flow in an axisymmetric bounded domain that we model using a pseudo-spectral differentiable solver, thereby enabling online learning. We examine three configurations, varying the geometry (between an exponential container and a spherical shell) and the rotation rate. Flow is driven by a prescribed analytical forcing, allowing for precise control over the energy injection scale and an exact estimate of the power input. We evaluate the accuracy of the online-trained SGS model against the reference direct numerical simulation using integral quantities and spectral diagnostics. In all configurations, we show that an SGS model trained on data spanning only one turnover time remains stable and accurate over integrations at least a hundred times longer than the training period. Moreover, we demonstrate the model's remarkable ability to reproduce slow processes occurring on time scales far exceeding the training duration, such as the inward drift of jets in the spherical shell. These results suggest a promising path towards developing SGS models for planetary and stellar interior dynamics, including dynamo processes."

The pairs of morphological features are two opposite rings, a strip of dense ejecta extending on both sides of the central pulsar PSR J1811-1925, and an ear-nozzle opposite structure. According to the JJEM, additional weaker pairs of jets may also have participated in the explosion. The jets' axis from the ear to the nozzle coincides with the axis of the presently active pulsar jets, which is the pulsar spin axis. The jets of this pair were the last that the newly born neutron star launched during the explosion, and the accretion disk that launched these jets spun up the neutron star in the same direction as the jets. The identification of a point-symmetric morphology in SNR G11.2-0.3 strengthens the claim that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe."

Deep QUIJOTE cosmological fields enable $β_s$ constraints even in intrinsically low SNR regions where WMAP+$Planck$ alone remain prior-dominated. Current combined sensitivities are insufficient to detect a synchrotron curvature of $C_s=-0.052$ on a pixel-by-pixel basis, but a $2σ$ detection is achievable for $|C_s|\\gtrsim 0.14$ in the brightest regions of the Galactic plane. In those deep cosmological fields, combining QUIJOTE-MFI2 with WMAP and $Planck$ reduces the median synchrotron residual at 100 GHz by a factor 2.2 (to 0.022 $μ$K$_{\\rm CMB}$) and the total residual by a factor 1.8 (to 0.030 $μ$K$_{\\rm CMB}$).

Here, we propose Apo2Mol, a diffusion-based generative framework for 3D molecule design that explicitly accounts for conformational flexibility in protein binding pockets. To support this, we curate a dataset of over 24,000 experimentally resolved apo-holo structure pairs from the Protein Data Bank, enabling the characterization of protein structure changes associated with ligand binding. Apo2Mol employs a full-atom hierarchical graph-based diffusion model that simultaneously generates 3D ligand molecules and their corresponding holo pocket conformations from input apo states.

    "abstract": "Structural nested mean models (SNMMs) are a principled approach to estimate the treatment effects over time. A particular strength of SNMMs is to break the joint effect of treatment sequences over time into localized, time-specific ``blip effects''. This decomposition promotes interpretability through the incremental effects and enables the efficient offline evaluation of optimal treatment policies without re-computation. However, neural frameworks for SNMMs are lacking, as their inherently sequential g-estimation scheme prevents end-to-end, gradient-based training. Here, we propose DeepBlip, the first neural framework for SNMMs, which overcomes this limitation with a novel double optimization trick to enable simultaneous learning of all blip functions. Our DeepBlip seamlessly integrates sequential neural networks like LSTMs or transformers to capture complex temporal dependencies. By design, our method correctly adjusts for time-varying confounding to produce unbiased estimates, and its Neyman-orthogonal loss function ensures robustness to nuisance model misspecification. Finally, we evaluate our DeepBlip across various clinical datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance."

    "abstract": "Bridging continuous perceptual signals and discrete symbolic reasoning is a fundamental challenge in AI systems that must operate under uncertainty. We present a neuro-symbolic framework that explicitly models and propagates uncertainty from perception to planning, providing a principled connection between these two abstraction levels. Our approach couples a transformer-based perceptual front-end with graph neural network (GNN) relational reasoning to extract probabilistic symbolic states from visual observations, and an uncertainty-aware symbolic planner that actively gathers information when confidence is low. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on tabletop robotic manipulation as a concrete application: the translator processes 10,047 PyBullet-generated scenes (3--10 objects) and outputs probabilistic predicates with calibrated confidences (overall F1=0.68). When embedded in the planner, the system achieves 94\\%/90\\%/88\\% success on Simple Stack, Deep Stack, and Clear+Stack benchmarks (90.7\\% average), exceeding the strongest POMDP baseline by 10--14 points while planning within 15\\,ms. A probabilistic graphical-model analysis establishes a quantitative link between calibrated uncertainty and planning convergence, providing theoretical guarantees that are validated empirically. The framework is general-purpose and can be applied to any domain requiring uncertainty-aware reasoning from perceptual input to symbolic planning."

    "abstract": "We study the cosmological impact of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) with a quadratic coupling to Standard Model particles. In addition to the suppression of small-scale power from ULDM itself, the coupling induces a variation of fundamental constants that is modulated by the ULDM oscillatory field value. In this work, we consider the ULDM-induced, time-dependent variation of the fine structure constant and the mass of the electron. These variations modify the predicted abundance of light elements during Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the process of recombination, thereby affecting the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We use CMB anisotropy data and baryon acoustic oscillation measurements to obtain constraints on the variation of couplings over a wide range of ULDM masses. We self-consistently account for the modification of the primordial helium abundance during BBN in computing the CMB power spectra. We find that the allowed ULDM fraction of total dark matter abundance is more constrained for ULDM masses $\\lesssim 10^{-26}~\\mathrm{eV}$ in the presence of the variations. Moreover, our constraints on the variational couplings for ULDM masses $\\lesssim 10^{-27}~\\mathrm{eV}$ are stronger than the ones derived from the primordial helium abundance at BBN. Under our ULDM model, the variation of fundamental constants has no appreciable impact on the Hubble constant inferred from CMB data and thus does not present a viable solution to the Hubble tension."

Instead of encoding RGB pixels directly, we decompose video content into distinct components via explicit decoupling: keyframe, motion and residual, and learn dedicated latent representation for each. To avoid cross-component interference, we design dedicated encoders for each decoupled component and adopt a shared 3D decoder to maintain spatiotemporal consistency during reconstruction. We further utilize a decoupled adaptation strategy that freezes partial encoders while training the others sequentially, ensuring stable training and accurate learning of both static and dynamic features. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DeCo-VAE achieves superior video reconstruction performance."

    "abstract": "Conventional high-altitude platforms (HAPs) face challenges in achieving continuous all-weather operation due to intermittent photovoltaic power generation, limited energy storage capacity, and high mission loads resulting from functional integration. To address this fundamental issue, we propose a stratospheric energy grid in which wireless power transfer (WPT) interconnections constitute the grid layer, while HAPs operate as dynamically reconfigurable integrated generation-grid-load-storage (IGGLS) nodes that harvest, buffer, consume, and peer-to-peer transfer energy for constellation-level balancing and resilience. In this system, each HAP node can flexibly switch among energy source, load, and storage roles according to its energy status and mission requirements, enabling energy exchange and spatiotemporal optimization within the stratosphere. Through cooperative scheduling, the stratospheric grid not only enables surplus-to-deficit energy support among HAPs but also extends upward to satellites and downward to the terrestrial grid and communication infrastructure, forming a heterogeneous, WPT-mediated interconnection. As an IGGLS ecosystem, it exploits peer-to-peer energy logistics, spatiotemporal smoothing of intermittency, cross-domain backup via the terrestrial grid, and service-aware dispatch, thereby boosting overall energy utilization and operational resilience. The proposed approach is validated through case studies, and we delineate an agenda of feasible research directions."

We exhibit notable properties of interest of the parameter Ie, in general and for particular classes of graphs, together with parameterized algorithms for several natural graph parameters. Despite the computational hardness previously exhibited by this problem (NP-hard, W[1]-hard w.r.t. feedback vertex number, W[1]-hard w.r.t. solution size), we present two FPT algorithms, the first w.r.t. the solution size plus Delta and the second w.r.t. the vertex cover number of the input graph. Finally, we take important steps towards better understanding the behaviour of this problem in dense graphs. This is crucial when considering some of the parameters whose behaviour is still uncharted in regards to this problem (e.g., neighbourhood diversity, distance to clique). In particular, we identify a subfamily of complete graphs for which we are able to provide the exact value of Ie(G). These investigations lead us to propose a conjecture that Ie(G) should always be at most m/3 + c, where $m$ is the number of edges of the graph $G$ and $c$ is some constant. This conjecture is verified for various families of graphs, including trees."

Distinct from approaches that employ Transformers to model holistic task relationships, PAMM leverages the rich, scalable parameters of state space models to enhance task interconnectivity. It features dual state space parameter experts that integrate and set task-specific parameter priors, capturing the intrinsic properties of each task. This approach not only facilitates precise multi-task interactions but also allows for the global integration of task priors through the structured state space sequence model (S4). Furthermore, we employ the Multi-Directional Hilbert Scanning method to construct multi-angle feature sequences, thereby enhancing the sequence model's perceptual capabilities for 2D data.

However, the inherent temporal heterogeneous induced by localized perturbations present significant challenges for generating structurally consistent time series. While flow matching provides a promising paradigm by modeling temporal dynamics through trajectory-level supervision, it fails to adequately capture abrupt transitions in perturbed time series, as the use of globally shared parameters constrains the velocity field to a unified representation. To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{PAFM}, a \\textbf{P}erturbation-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{F}low \\textbf{M}atching framework that models perturbed trajectories to ensure stable and structurally consistent time series generation. The framework incorporates perturbation-guided training to simulate localized disturbances and leverages a dual-path velocity field to capture trajectory deviations under perturbation, enabling refined modeling of perturbed behavior to enhance the structural coherence. In order to further improve sensitivity to trajectory perturbations while enhancing expressiveness, a mixture-of-experts decoder with flow routing dynamically allocates modeling capacity in response to different trajectory dynamics. Extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation tasks demonstrate that PAFM consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Echo state networks (ESN) are a model class in which the reservoir is a traditional artificial neural network. This class contains many model types, each with sets of hyperparameters. Selecting models and parameter settings for particular applications requires a theory for predicting and comparing performances. Here, we demonstrate that recent developments of perceptron theory can be used to predict the memory capacity and accuracy of a wide variety of ESN models, including reservoirs with linear neurons, sigmoid nonlinear neurons, different types of recurrent matrices, and different types of readout networks. Across thirty variants of ESNs, we show that empirical results consistently confirm the theory's predictions. As a practical demonstration, the theory is used to optimize memory capacity of an ESN in the entire joint parameter space. Further, guided by the theory, we propose a novel ESN model with a readout network that does not require training, and which outperforms earlier ESN models without training. Finally, we characterize the geometry of the readout networks in ESNs, which reveals that many ESN models exhibit a similar regular simplex geometry as has been observed in the output weights of deep neural networks."

The concepts are gradually introduced, starting with a highlight of its diverse applications across the broader field of engineering. The paper then presents four detailed, state-of-the-art use case applications specifically within electrical engineering. These case studies demonstrate practical impact, ranging from an advanced agentic framework for streamlining complex power system studies and benchmarking to a novel system developed for survival analysis of dynamic pricing strategies in battery swapping stations. Finally, to ensure robust deployment, the paper provides detailed failure mode investigations. From these findings, we derive actionable recommendations for the design and implementation of safe, reliable, and accountable agentic AI systems, offering a critical resource for researchers and practitioners."

To overcome this, we propose CompEvent, a complex neural network framework enabling holistic full-process fusion of event data and RGB frames for enhanced joint restoration. CompEvent features two core components: 1) Complex Temporal Alignment GRU, which utilizes complex-valued convolutions and processes video and event streams iteratively via GRU to achieve temporal alignment and continuous fusion; and 2) Complex Space-Frequency Learning module, which performs unified complex-valued signal processing in both spatial and frequency domains, facilitating deep fusion through spatial structures and system-level characteristics. By leveraging the holistic representation capability of complex-valued neural networks, CompEvent achieves full-process spatiotemporal fusion, maximizes complementary learning between modalities, and significantly strengthens low-light video deblurring capability.

    "abstract": "Achieving precise time synchronization in wireless systems is essential for both industrial applications and 5G, where sub-microsecond accuracy is required. However, since the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) market is negligible compared to the consumer electronics market, the so-called IIoT enhancements have not yet been implemented in silicon. Moreover, there is no guarantee that this situation will change soon. Thus, alternative solutions must be explored. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a scheme that uses a protocol capable of leveraging existing infrastructure to synchronize User Equipments (UEs), with one of the UEs serving as the master. If this master is connected via a wired link to the factory network, it can also function as a boundary clock for the factory network, including any Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) network. Furthermore, the 5G Core Network (5GC) and 5G Base Station (gNB) can also be synchronized if they are connected either to the factory network or to the master UE. The proposed solution is implemented and evaluated on a hardware testbed using OpenAirInterface (OAI) and Software Defined Radios (SDRs). Time offset and clock skew are analyzed using a moving average filter with various window sizes. Results show that a filter size of 1024 provides the best accuracy for offset prediction between UEs. In a controlled lab environment, the approach consistently achieves synchronization within +/-50 ns, leaving sufficient margin for synchronization errors in real deployments while still maintaining sub-microsecond accuracy. These findings demonstrate the feasibility and high performance of the proposed protocol for stringent industrial use cases."

Unfortunately, the prediction of key cardiac biomarkers from PPG instead of APW remains an open challenge, further complicated by the scarcity of annotated PPG measurements. As a solution, we propose a hybrid approach that uses hemodynamic simulations and unlabeled clinical data to estimate cardiovascular biomarkers directly from PPG signals. Our hybrid model combines a conditional variational autoencoder trained on paired PPG-APW data with a conditional density estimator of cardiac biomarkers trained on labeled simulated APW segments. As a key result, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect fluctuations of cardiac output and stroke volume and outperform a supervised baseline in monitoring temporal changes in these biomarkers."

To overcome these limitations, we propose Agentic Video Intelligence (AVI), a flexible and training-free framework that can mirror human video comprehension through system-level design and optimization. AVI introduces three key innovations: (1) a human-inspired three-phase reasoning process (Retrieve-Perceive-Review) that ensures both sufficient global exploration and focused local analysis, (2) a structured video knowledge base organized through entity graphs, along with multi-granularity integrated tools, constituting the agent's interaction environment, and (3) an open-source model ensemble combining reasoning LLMs with lightweight base CV models and VLM, eliminating dependence on proprietary APIs or RL training.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the information-theoretic decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) problem under practical groupwise secret keys and collusion resilience. In DSA, $K$ users are interconnected through error-free broadcast channels. Each user holds a private input and aims to compute the sum of all other users' inputs, while satisfying the security constraint that no user, even when colluding with up to $T$ other users, can infer any information about the inputs beyond the recovered sum. To ensure security, users are equipped with secret keys to mask their inputs. Motivated by recent advances in efficient group-based key generation protocols, we consider the symmetric groupwise key setting, where every subset of $G$ users shares a group key that is independent of all other group keys. The problem is challenging because the recovery and security constraints must hold simultaneously for all users, and the structural constraints on the secret keys limit the flexibility of key correlations. We characterize the optimal rate region consisting of all achievable pairs of per-user broadcast communication rate and groupwise key rate. In particular, we show that DSA with groupwise keys is infeasible when $G=1$ or $G\\ge K-T$. Otherwise, when $2\\le G<K-T$, to securely compute one symbol of the desired sum, each user must broadcast at least one symbol, and each group key must contain at least $(K-T-2)/\\binom{K-T-1}{G}$ independent symbols. Our results establish the fundamental limits of DSA with groupwise keys and provide design insights for communication- and key-efficient secure aggregation in decentralized learning systems."

We present MedBench v4, a nationwide, cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure comprising over 700,000 expert-curated tasks spanning 24 primary and 91 secondary specialties, with dedicated tracks for LLMs, multimodal models, and agents. Items undergo multi-stage refinement and multi-round review by clinicians from more than 500 institutions, and open-ended responses are scored by an LLM-as-a-judge calibrated to human ratings. We evaluate 15 frontier models. Base LLMs reach a mean overall score of 54.1/100 (best: Claude Sonnet 4.5, 62.5/100), but safety and ethics remain low (18.4/100). Multimodal models perform worse overall (mean 47.5/100; best: GPT-5, 54.9/100), with solid perception yet weaker cross-modal reasoning. Agents built on the same backbones substantially improve end-to-end performance (mean 79.8/100), with Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents achieving up to 85.3/100 overall and 88.9/100 on safety tasks. MedBench v4 thus reveals persisting gaps in multimodal reasoning and safety for base models, while showing that governance-aware agentic orchestration can markedly enhance benchmarked clinical readiness without sacrificing capability. By aligning tasks with Chinese clinical guidelines and regulatory priorities, the platform offers a practical reference for hospitals, developers, and policymakers auditing medical AI."

    "abstract": "In the development of safety and mission-critical systems, including autonomous space robotic missions, complex behaviour is captured during the requirements elicitation phase. Requirements are typically expressed using natural language which is ambiguous and not amenable to formal verification methods that can provide robust guarantees of system behaviour. To support the definition of formal requirements, specification patterns provide reusable, logic-based templates. A suite of robotic specification patterns, along with their formalisation in NASA's Formal Requirements Elicitation Tool (FRET) already exists. These pre-existing requirement patterns are domain agnostic and, in this paper we explore their applicability for space missions. To achieve this we carried out a literature review of existing space missions and formalised their requirements using FRET, contributing a corpus of space mission requirements. We categorised these requirements using pre-existing specification patterns which demonstrated their applicability in space missions. However, not all of the requirements that we formalised corresponded to an existing pattern so we have contributed 5 new requirement specification patterns as well as several variants of the existing and new patterns. We also conducted an expert evaluation of the new patterns, highlighting their benefits and limitations."

    "abstract": "Effective contact-rich manipulation requires robots to synergistically leverage vision, force, and proprioception. However, Reinforcement Learning agents struggle to learn in such multisensory settings, especially amidst sensory noise and dynamic changes. We propose MultiSensory Dynamic Pretraining (MSDP), a novel framework for learning expressive multisensory representations tailored for task-oriented policy learning. MSDP is based on masked autoencoding and trains a transformer-based encoder by reconstructing multisensory observations from only a subset of sensor embeddings, leading to cross-modal prediction and sensor fusion. For downstream policy learning, we introduce a novel asymmetric architecture, where a cross-attention mechanism allows the critic to extract dynamic, task-specific features from the frozen embeddings, while the actor receives a stable pooled representation to guide its actions. Our method demonstrates accelerated learning and robust performance under diverse perturbations, including sensor noise, and changes in object dynamics. Evaluations in multiple challenging, contact-rich robot manipulation tasks in simulation and the real world showcase the effectiveness of MSDP. Our approach exhibits strong robustness to perturbations and achieves high success rates on the real robot with as few as 6,000 online interactions, offering a simple yet powerful solution for complex multisensory robotic control."

    "abstract": "Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are a crucial component of the future non-terrestrial networks (NTN) due to lower latency, robust signal strengths, shorter revisit times, and dense constellations. However, acquiring reliable channel state information (CSI) in LEO satellite communication remains challenging owing to severe signal attenuation over long propagation distances and short coherence times. Despite these challenges, LEO channels benefit from pronounced line-of-sight dominance and geometric properties inherently tied to positioning information. In this work, we propose an integrated positioning and communication (IPAC) framework for multi-LEO satellite networks to address the unique challenges posed by LEO channels. Specifically, we leverage in-the-loop LEO positioning to exploit users' position information for improving uplink CSI acquisition. To overcome the link-budget limitations of single-satellite systems, cooperative multi-LEO uplink data detection is adopted. By exploiting the different coherent timescales of position-related parameters and random channel gains, we develop a dual-timescale Kalman filter-based IPAC framework: an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) for tracking users' position and velocity in the large-timescale, and a Kalman filter that leverages the position information obtained in the large-timescale for improved data-aided uplink channel estimation in the small-timescale. Finally, the two tasks of channel estimation and cooperative data detection are jointly addressed through the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed IPAC approach outperforms the conventional baseline in terms of channel estimation accuracy and communication performance."

    "abstract": "Alterations in functional brain connectivity characterize neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). As a non-invasive and cost-effective technique, electroencephalography (EEG) is gaining increasing attention for its potential to identify reliable biomarkers for early detection and differential diagnosis of AD and FTD. Considering the behavioral similarities of signals from adjacent EEG channels, we propose a new spectral dependence measure, the nonlinear vector coherence (NVC), to capture beyond-linear interactions between oscillations of two multivariate time series observed from distinct brain regions. This addresses the limitations of conventional channel-to-channel approaches and defines a more natural region-to-region connectivity framework in the frequency domain. As a result, the NVC measure offers a new approach to investigate dependence between brain regions, which then enables to identify altered functional connectivity dynamics associated with AD and FTD. We further introduce a rank-based inference procedure that enables fast and distribution-free estimation of the proposed measure, as well as a fully nonparametric test for spectral independence. The empirical performance of our proposed inference methodology is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments. An application to resting-state EEG data reveals that our novel NVC measure uncovers distinct and diagnostically meaningful connectivity patterns which effectively discriminate healthy individuals from those with AD and FTD."

This study presents an updated catalogue of 620 exoplanet ephemerides, integrating 30000 measurements from ground-based telescopes (the ExoClock network), literature, and space telescopes (Kepler, K2 and TESS). The updated catalogue includes 277 planets from TESS which require special observing strategies due to their shallow transits or bright host stars. This study demonstrates that data from larger telescopes and the employment of new methodologies such as synchronous observations with small telescopes, are capable of monitoring special cases of planets. The new ephemerides show that 45% of the planets required an update while the results show an improvement of one order of magnitude in prediction uncertainty. The collective analysis also enabled the identification of new planets showing TTVs, highlighting the importance of extensive observing coverage. Developed in the context of the ESA's Ariel space mission, with the goal of delivering a catalogue with reliable ephemerides to increase the mission efficiency, ExoClock's scope and service have grown well beyond the remit of Ariel. The ExoClock project has been operating in the framework of open science, and all tools and products are accessible to everyone within academia and beyond, to support efficient scheduling of future exoplanet observations, especially from larger telescopes where the pressure for time allocation efficiency is higher (Ariel, JWST, VLT, ELT, Subaru etc). The inclusion of diverse audiences in the process and the collaborative mode not only foster democratisation of science but also enhance the quality of the results."

    "abstract": "We theoretically investigate the shape dependence and microscopic mechanism of the magnetoelectric effect, including both nonmagnetic (Edelstein-type) and magnetic origins, in a V-shaped one-dimensional chain model. Numerical calculations based on the Kubo formula reveal that the magnitude of the nonmagnetic-driven magnetoelectric response reaches a maximum at an apex angle of $θ\\approx 0.6π$. To clarify the microscopic origin of this behavior, we construct a low-energy effective Hamiltonian by projecting onto the $s$-orbital subspace and demonstrate that the polarity induced by the V-shaped geometry manifests as an effective spin--orbit interaction. An analytical derivation of the Green's function shows that the geometric effect appears as a $T$-matrix contribution, reflecting the local breaking of translational symmetry at the V-shaped edge. Furthermore, by employing a multipole-basis representation, we identify the selection rules that govern the magnetoelectric tensor and reveal that the coupling between the effective spin--orbit interaction and the orbital angular momentum generated across the apex plays an essential role. The resulting angular dependence, $\\sinθ\\sin{θ/2}$, peaks at $θ= 2\\tan^{-1}\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.608π$, in good agreement with the numerical results. We also analyze a ferromagnetic V-shaped model including the Zeeman interaction and show that the magnetic-driven magnetoelectric response originates from the spin magnetization induced by the coupling between the electric-field--driven charge-potential gradient and the Zeeman term. These findings demonstrate that the V-shaped geometry gives rise to distinct magnetoelectric mechanisms depending on the presence or absence of time-reversal symmetry and provide a microscopic framework for understanding shape-induced multipole phenomena in mesoscopic and bulk systems."

We studied the transitions between oscillation quenching states induced by the time-varying form of the coupling function while the coupling strength is kept invariant. The time-varying periodic coupling function allowed us to identify novel, non-trivial inhomogeneous states that have not been reported previously. Furthermore, by using dynamical Bayesian inference we have also developed a Proportional Integral (PI) controller that maintains the oscillations and \\red{prevents oscillation quenching from occurring}. In addition to the present implementation and its generalizations, the framework carries broader implications for identification and control of oscillation quenching in a wide range of systems subjected to time-varying interactions."

We present the QHSC catalog, a machine-learning selected sample of quasar candidates with photometric redshifts in the Wide layer of the HSC-SSP survey (Public Data Release 3). The full QHSC catalog contains four distinct samples: a master sample with HSC-only photometry, an HSC+WISE sample, and two samples including near-infrared data from UKIDSS and VISTA, denoted as GoldenU and GoldenV. For each sample, an XGBoost classifier is trained and evaluated using independent spectroscopic test sets from HETDEX, VVDS, and zCOSMOS-bright. The numbers of quasar candidates in the QHSC catalog are 1,184,574 (master), 371,777 (HSC+WISE), 87,460 (GoldenU), and 120,572 (GoldenV), with respective completeness values of 85.3%, 92.7%, 89.8%, and 91.3%. We develop ensemble photometric redshift estimators based on bootstrap aggregating (bagging) of multiple XGBoost regressors, achieving outlier fractions of 21.7%, 13.1%, 9.5%, and 10.7% for these samples. The catalog provides quasar classification probabilities (p_QSO), enabling construction of purer subsamples via thresholding. This work offers a valuable resource for studies of quasars and cosmology, and highlights the effectiveness of machine learning for quasar selection in future wide and deep imaging surveys.

Moreover, within individual spatially resolved on-arm and off-arm M31 GMCs, the SFE is considerably lower than the SFE in molecular clouds in main sequence and green valley galaxies. Follow-up investigations on M31 GMCs may provide clues for how star formation may be quenched in galactic environments. Finally, we reconstrained the dust opacity spectral index $β$ in the M31 galaxy by combining our new JCMT observations with archival Herschel and Planck data and found that the radial variation of $β$ may not be as large as was proposed by previous studies."

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a fast, high-quality method for novel view synthesis (NVS). However, its use of low-degree spherical harmonics limits its ability to capture spatially varying color and view-dependent effects such as specular highlights. Existing works augment Gaussians with either a global texture map, which struggles with complex scenes, or per-Gaussian texture maps, which introduces high storage overhead. We propose Image-Based Gaussian Splatting, an efficient alternative that leverages high-resolution source images for fine details and view-specific color modeling. Specifically, we model each pixel color as a combination of a base color from standard 3DGS rendering and a learned residual inferred from neighboring training images. This promotes accurate surface alignment and enables rendering images of high-frequency details and accurate view-dependent effects. Experiments on standard NVS benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms prior Gaussian Splatting approaches in rendering quality, without increasing the storage footprint."

We construct a high-purity sample of $3061$ galaxy groups and clusters spanning the redshift range $0.05<z<1.07$ and mass range of $1.1\\times10^{13}<M_{500}/$M$_{\\odot}<1.6\\times10^{15}$. This represents the largest sample to date used for scaling relation analysis. The selection function, derived from state-of-the-art simulations of the eROSITA sky, is rigorously incorporated into our modeling. We report best-fit parameters - normalization, slope, redshift evolution, and intrinsic scatter - for a set of scaling relations: $L_{\\mathrm{X}}-T$, $L_{\\mathrm{X}}-M_{\\rm gas}$, $L_{\\mathrm{X}}-Y_{\\rm X}$, as well as the $M_{\\rm gas}-T$ relation. Our best-fit models indicate that the slopes of the scaling relations deviate significantly from self-similar expectations, while the redshift evolution remains consistent with the self-similar model. The fits exhibit small statistical uncertainties, likely owing to the large sample size. Our results are in good agreement with previous observational studies that account for selection effects, as well as with simulations that incorporate non-gravitational physics."

    "abstract": "A computational PDE-constrained optimization approach is proposed for optimal trajectory planning under uncertainty by means of an associated Schroedinger Bridge Problem (SBP). The proposed SBP formulation is interpreted as the mean-field limit associated to the energy-optimal evolution of a particle governed by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with nonlinear drift and reflecting boundary conditions, constrained to initial and terminal densities for its state. The resulting mean-field system consists of a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation coupled with a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, subject to two-point boundary conditions in time and Neumann boundary conditions in space. Through the Hopf-Cole transformation, this nonlinear system is recast as a pair of forward-backward advection-diffusion equations, which are amenable to efficient numerical solution via standard finite element discretization. The weak formulation naturally enforces reflecting boundary conditions without requiring explicit particle-boundary collision detection, thus circumventing the computational difficulties inherent to particle-based methods in complex geometries. Numerical experiments on challenging 3D maze configurations demonstrate fast convergence, mass conservation, and validate the optimal controls computed through reflected SDE simulations."

However, existing approaches are constrained by small-scale training with annotations that are typical short and coarse, restricting generalization to nuanced transitions in long videos. We introduce ARC-Chapter, the first large-scale video chaptering model trained on over million-level long video chapters, featuring bilingual, temporally grounded, and hierarchical chapter annotations. To achieve this goal, we curated a bilingual English-Chinese chapter dataset via a structured pipeline that unifies ASR transcripts, scene texts, visual captions into multi-level annotations, from short title to long summaries. We demonstrate clear performance improvements with data scaling, both in data volume and label intensity. Moreover, we design a new evaluation metric termed GRACE, which incorporates many-to-one segment overlaps and semantic similarity, better reflecting real-world chaptering flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARC-Chapter establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin, outperforming the previous best by 14.0% in F1 score and 11.3% in SODA score. Moreover, ARC-Chapter shows excellent transferability, improving the state-of-the-art on downstream tasks like dense video captioning on YouCook2."

    "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a new paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical laws into the learning process of neural networks. However, despite their foundational role, the hidden irreversibility implied by the Second Law of Thermodynamics is often neglected during training, leading to unphysical solutions or even training failures in conventional PINNs. In this paper, we identify this critical gap and introduce a simple, generalized, yet robust irreversibility-regularized strategy that enforces hidden physical laws as soft constraints during training. This approach ensures that the learned solutions consistently respect the intrinsic one-way nature of irreversible physical processes. Across a wide range of benchmarks spanning traveling wave propagation, steady combustion, ice melting, corrosion evolution, and crack propagation, we demonstrate that our regularization scheme reduces predictive errors by more than an order of magnitude, while requiring only minimal modification to existing PINN frameworks. We believe that the proposed framework is broadly applicable to a wide class of PDE-governed physical systems and will have significant impact within the scientific machine learning community."

At each $μ$-position, the spectra are spatially averaged over 0.02 $μ$, and the resulting CLVs are given both as these averaged data points and as smooth polynomial curves fitted across each wavelength point. The He I spectra were inverted using the HAnle and ZEeman Light (HAZEL) code, showing an increase in optical depth towards the limb and a reversed convective blueshift for the red component, while the blue component was entirely absent. In addition, we find a strong increase in the steepness of the He I CLV compared to that of the nearby continuum. The Si I showed a behavior more typical of photospheric lines, namely shallower CLV, a reduction in width and depth, and a more typical convective blueshift."

It identifies how AI intersects with major areas of science education research, including curriculum development, assessment, epistemic cognition, inclusion, and teacher professional development, highlighting cases where AI can support human reasoning and cases where it may introduce risks to equity or validity. The report also examines how AI is transforming methodological approaches across quantitative, qualitative, ethnographic, and design-based traditions, giving rise to hybrid forms of analysis that combine human and computational strengths. To guide responsible integration, a systems-thinking heuristic is introduced that helps researchers consider stakeholder needs, potential risks, and ethical constraints.

We describe a concrete example in which the vortex solutions that are realised in a prototypical pseudo-Hermitian field theory exhibit a novel metastability, despite the model parameters residing within the naively stable regime of exact antilinear symmetry of the vacuum theory. This instability is identified analytically and confirmed through numerical simulations, and it arises from the small breaking of the underlying antilinear symmetry of the pseudo-Hermitian theory due to the presence of the topological defect. This leads to spacetime-dependent parameters in the equations of motion governing fluctuations around the vortex, inducing non-trivial exceptional-point structures and complex frequencies within their spectrum. Aside from offering intriguing possibilities for cosmology, this result serves to illustrate the ability to produce long-lived metastable configurations in pseudo-Hermitian field theories of relevance beyond cosmology and high energy physics."

We give an ancilla-free, depth-optimal encoder that prepares a W_n state using n-1 two-qubit rotations per block, and a two-local XY mixer restricted to the same block of n qubits with a constant spectral gap. Algorithmically, we wrap constant-depth sampling with a deterministic classical checker to obtain a polynomial-time hybrid quantum-classical solver (PHQC) that returns the best observed feasible solution in O(S n^2) time, where S is the number of shots. We obtain two advantages. First, when CE-QAOA fixes r >= 1 locations different from the start city, we achieve a Theta(n^r) reduction in shot complexity even against a classical sampler that draws uniformly from the feasible set. Second, against a classical baseline restricted to raw bitstring sampling, we show an exp(Theta(n^2)) separation in the minimax sense. In noiseless circuit simulations of TSP instances ranging from 4 to 10 locations from the QOPTLib benchmark library, we recover the global optimum at depth p = 1 using polynomial shot budgets and coarse parameter grids defined by the problem sizes."

    "abstract": "In computer- and robot-assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS), patient-specific surgical plans derived from preoperative imaging define target locations and implant trajectories. During surgery, these plans must be accurately transferred, relying on precise cross-registration between preoperative and intraoperative data. However, substantial modality heterogeneity across imaging modalities makes this registration challenging and error-prone. Robust, automatic, and modality-agnostic bone surface registration is therefore clinically important. We propose NeuralBoneReg, a self-supervised, surface-based framework that registers bone surfaces using 3D point clouds as a modality-agnostic representation. NeuralBoneReg includes two modules: an implicit neural unsigned distance field (UDF) that learns the preoperative bone model, and an MLP-based registration module that performs global initialization and local refinement by generating transformation hypotheses to align the intraoperative point cloud with the neural UDF. Unlike SOTA supervised methods, NeuralBoneReg operates in a self-supervised manner, without requiring inter-subject training data. We evaluated NeuralBoneReg against baseline methods on two publicly available multi-modal datasets: a CT-ultrasound dataset of the fibula and tibia (UltraBones100k) and a CT-RGB-D dataset of spinal vertebrae (SpineDepth). The evaluation also includes a newly introduced CT--ultrasound dataset of cadaveric subjects containing femur and pelvis (UltraBones-Hip), which will be made publicly available. NeuralBoneReg matches or surpasses existing methods across all datasets, achieving mean RRE/RTE of 1.68°/1.86 mm on UltraBones100k, 1.88°/1.89 mm on UltraBones-Hip, and 3.79°/2.45 mm on SpineDepth.

However, how reasoning strategies affect the estimated confidence is still under-explored. In this work, we demonstrate that predicting a verbalized probability distribution can effectively encourage in-depth reasoning for confidence estimation. Intuitively, it requires an LLM to consider all candidates within the answer space instead of basing on a single guess, and to carefully assign confidence scores to meet the requirements of a distribution. This method shows an advantage across different models and various tasks, regardless of whether the answer space is known. Its advantage is maintained even after reinforcement learning, and further analysis shows its reasoning patterns are aligned with human expectations."

Graphene oxide was synthesized using a modified Hummers method and subsequently thermally reduced at 300\\,°C, 500\\,°C, and 700\\,°C under vacuum to systematically vary the oxygen content and structural ordering. The specific heat data in the 2--300\\,K range reveal that the thermal response is governed by phonons, including contributions from a Schottky-type anomaly, a defect-related linear term, a Debye term, and a dispersive term with a negative coefficient associated with out-of-plane flexural (ZA) phonons. Increasing compaction pressure alters interlayer coupling and leads to non-monotonic changes in heat capacity, while higher annealing temperatures enhance graphitization, reduce disorder, and modify phonon dispersion. The absence of a boson peak -- similar to that observed in carbon nanotubes -- supports the dominance of two-dimensional vibrational modes. These findings elucidate the relationship between dimensionality, structural disorder, and processing parameters in shaping the phonon dynamics of trGO, providing guidance for tailoring its thermal behavior in advanced carbon-based functional materials."

However, given access to some data from downstream tasks, a natural question arises: can the performance of these models be further improved? To this end, we propose WeSTAR, a parameter-efficient framework that performs Weakly supervised Self-Training Adaptation with Regularization, designed to enhance the robustness of MDE foundation models in unseen and diverse domains. We first adopt a dense self-training objective as the primary source of structural self-supervision. To further improve robustness, we introduce semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, which exploits instance-level segmentation maps to perform more stable and multi-scale structural normalization. Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge. Extensive experiments on both realistic and corrupted out-of-distribution datasets under diverse and challenging scenarios demonstrate that WeSTAR consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks."

This task is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and corporate profits. Existing recommendation models struggle with complex operation logic, diverse user preferences, and sensitive to suboptimal suggestions, limiting their applicability to IoT device operations. To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations. Extensive experiments show that DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets, with an average improvement of 69.5% across all metrics. DevPiolt has been practically deployed in Xiaomi Home app for one quarter, providing daily operation recommendations to 255,000 users.

While traditional ensemble prediction (EPS) addresses this through computationally intensive simulations, recent advances in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL) offer a promising but often disconnected alternative. We bridge these paradigms through a unified hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning framework for ensemble weather forecasting that explicitly decomposes predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, learned via variational inference and a physics-informed stochastic perturbation scheme modeling flow-dependent atmospheric dynamics, respectively. We further establish a unified theoretical framework that rigorously connects BDL and EPS, providing formal theorems that decompose total predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components under the hybrid BDL framework. We validate our framework on the large-scale 40-year ERA5 reanalysis dataset (1979-2019) with 0.25° spatial resolution. Experimental results show that our method not only improves forecast accuracy and yields better-calibrated uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic diffusion models. We commit to making our code open-source upon acceptance of this paper."

    "abstract": "An increasing penetration of renewable energy resources, electric vehicle chargers, and energy storage systems into low-voltage power grids causes several power management and stability problems, such as reverse power flow, (local) overload lines, and over- / under-voltage. Previous power-flow and soft-open-point solutions are bulky and expensive. They need transformers and large magnetics, some on grid frequency, others more compact at high frequency. Even suggested circuits with high-frequency transformers still struggle with cost and size. We present a compact partial power-conversion high-current full-power-flow control circuit without a single transformer. We combine silicon and silicon-carbide, each with their specific advantages for current-dense direct injection. The circuit further needs fewer semiconductors than previous concepts. The circuit links a shunt converter through a non-isolated inverter bidirectionally with low-voltage series modules that practically float with their respective phases can serve between different feeders in low-voltage power grids. We analyze the circuit mathematically and evaluate the operation in simulation and experimental results."

    "abstract": "In k-essence theories within general relativity, where the matter Lagrangian depends on a real scalar field $φ$ and its kinetic term $X$, static and spherically symmetric compact objects with a positive-definite energy density cannot exist without introducing ghosts. We show that this no-go theorem can be evaded when the k-essence Lagrangian is extended to include a dependence on the field strength $F$ of a $U(1)$ gauge field, taking the general form ${\\cal L}(φ, X, F)$. In Einstein-scalar-Maxwell theories with a scalar-vector coupling $μ(φ) F$, we demonstrate the existence of asymptotically flat, charged compact stars whose energy density and pressure vanish at the center. With an appropriate choice of the coupling function $μ(φ)$, we construct both electric and magnetic compact objects and derive their metric functions and scalar- and vector-field profiles analytically. We compute their masses and radii, showing that the compactness lies in the range ${\\cal O}(0.01)<{\\cal C}<{\\cal O}(0.1)$. A linear perturbation analysis reveals that electric compact objects are free of strong coupling, ghost, and Laplacian instabilities at all radii for $μ(φ)>0$, while magnetic compact objects suffer from strong coupling near the center."

Analytic estimates of their density indicate that they are compatible with standard cosmology only if their mass is less than $10^{11}$ GeV. We initiate a programme of numerical studies of monopole dynamics by simulating a gas of 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles formed by the Kibble mechanism after a phase transition. In this paper we simulate monopoles in a radiation background, but without interactions with the radiation, in order to resolve differences between analytical models. We find that during the radiation era, the monopoles find each other and annihilate efficiently enough to keep their density fraction constant, which supports the modelling of Zel'dovich and Khlopov and Preskill in the epoch when plasma interactions can be neglected. In the matter era the density fraction decreases logarithmically. Further work is needed to quantify the effect of the thermal bath, which is expected to reduce the annihilation rate at later times."

    "abstract": "Compute-in-Memory (CIM) and weight sparsity are two effective techniques to reduce data movement during Neural Network (NN) inference. However, they can hardly be employed in the same accelerator simultaneously because CIM requires structural compute patterns which are disrupted in sparse NNs. In this paper, we partially solve this issue by proposing a bit level weight reordering strategy which can realize compact mapping of sparse NN weight matrices onto Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) based NN Accelerators (RRAM-Acc). In specific, when weights are mapped to RRAM crossbars in a binary complement manner, we can observe that, which can also be mathematically proven, bit-level sparsity and similarity commonly exist in the crossbars. The bit reordering method treats bit sparsity as a special case of bit similarity, reserve only one column in a pair of columns that have identical bit values, and then map the compressed weight matrices into Operation Units (OU). The performance of our design is evaluated with typical NNs. Simulation results show a 61.24% average performance improvement and 1.51x-2.52x energy savings under different sparsity ratios, with only slight overhead compared to the state-of-the-art design."

In order to gather such detailed insight, small prototype systems that cover the essence of such processes need to be identified and investigated. Here, we employ a small system consisting of a combination of covalent and van der Waals bonds for our studies, namely N2Ar dimers. We use synchrotron radiation to site-selectively enable the charge transfer processes and perform a coincidence measurement of the resulting electrons and ions. In combination with ab initio calculations, this approach enables a step-by-step tracking of the charge transfer and fragmentation dynamics. We find that ultrafast structural evolution of the dimer can trigger a second CT, thereby opening complex reaction pathways, in which electrons transfer back and forth between Ar and N2, and nonadiabatic transitions occur twice through conical intersections. These results demonstrate that multiple CT-induced transitions, particularly in such a simple dimer system, provide benchmark insights into the mechanisms of nonadiabatic reactions in complex natural systems."

In other words, $(|S_n^{p}|)_{n\\geq 0}$ is stochastically decreasing in $p \\in [0,1/2]$ and increasing in $p\\in [1/2,1]$. An analogous result is also given for the family of normal random walks indexed by $μ\\in R$ where each of the independent increments is normally distributed with common mean $μ$ and variance $1$. Extension to Brownian motion then follows by a limiting argument. As an application, these results are used to easily derive stochastic ordering properties for stopping times of Bernoulli and normal random walks."

    "abstract": "Long COVID \"brain fog\" is a common and debilitating subjective syndrome often associated with persistent cognitive impairment after COVID-19 infection. Here we identify a specific regional brain dysfunction that mediates this cognitive impairment and provide evidence that targeted neuromodulation improves this deficit. In 120 patients with long COVID brain fog, we found an aberrant perceptual processing pattern. Patients with more severe brain fog committed significantly more false alarms (impulsive responses to non-signals) despite preserved overall accuracy. Both high-density (128-channel) EEG and structural MRI analyses provided converging evidence of a right inferior insula deficit, characterized by a blunted neural monitoring signal and cortical atrophy. We confirmed this deficit in a separate 796-participant UK Biobank longitudinal COVID re-imaging cohort, where COVID-19 survivors also showed selective impairment on a perceptual processing task and corresponding longitudinal atrophy of the right inferior insula compared with healthy controls. Finally, in a proof-of-principle randomized, sham-controlled trial (n = 40), a non-invasive, excitatory theta-burst ultrasound stimulation protocol targeting the right inferior insula rescued the perceptual deficit by reducing false alarms. These findings provide evidence of a causal role for right inferior insula dysfunction in long COVID-related perceptual impairment and show that modulation of this region can rescue the deficit, establishing it as a novel therapeutic target for long COVID cognitive impairment."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems play a vital role in alleviating information overload and enriching users' online experience. In the era of large language models (LLMs), LLM-based recommender systems have emerged as a prevalent paradigm for advancing personalized recommendations. Recently, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has drawn growing interest to facilitate the recommendation capability of LLMs, incorporating useful information retrieved from external knowledge bases. However, as a rich source of up-to-date information, the web remains under-explored by existing RAG-based recommendations. In particular, unique challenges are posed from two perspectives: one is to generate effective queries for web retrieval, considering the inherent knowledge gap between web search and recommendations; another challenge lies in harnessing online websites that contain substantial noisy content. To tackle these limitations, we propose WebRec, a novel web-based RAG framework, which takes advantage of the reasoning capability of LLMs to interpret recommendation tasks into queries of user preferences that cater to web retrieval. Moreover, given noisy web-retrieved information, where relevant pieces of evidence are scattered far apart, an insightful MP-Head is designed to enhance LLM attentions between distant tokens of relevant information via message passing. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed web-based RAG methods in recommendation scenarios."

    "abstract": "Existing self-supervised contrastive learning methods for skeleton-based action recognition often process all skeleton regions uniformly, and adopt a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue to store negative samples, which leads to motion information loss and non-optimal negative sample selection. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Dominance-Game Contrastive Learning network for skeleton-based action Recognition (DoGCLR), a self-supervised framework based on game theory. DoGCLR models the construction of positive and negative samples as a dynamic Dominance Game, where both sample types interact to reach an equilibrium that balances semantic preservation and discriminative strength. Specifically, a spatio-temporal dual weight localization mechanism identifies key motion regions and guides region-wise augmentations to enhance motion diversity while maintaining semantics. In parallel, an entropy-driven dominance strategy manages the memory bank by retaining high entropy (hard) negatives and replacing low-entropy (weak) ones, ensuring consistent exposure to informative contrastive signals. Extensive experiments are conducted on NTU RGB+D and PKU-MMD datasets. On NTU RGB+D 60 X-Sub/X-View, DoGCLR achieves 81.1%/89.4% accuracy, and on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Sub/X-Set, DoGCLR achieves 71.2%/75.5% accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 0.1%, 2.7%, 1.1%, and 2.3%, respectively. On PKU-MMD Part I/Part II, DoGCLR performs comparably to the state-of-the-art methods and achieves a 1.9% higher accuracy on Part II, highlighting its strong robustness on more challenging scenarios."

Due to the unique design of KPF, we developed a publicly available pipeline for KPF that performs blaze removal, continuum normalization, order stitching, science spectra combination, telluric correction, and atmospheric detection via cross-correlation. As a first demonstration, we applied this pipeline to a transit of WASP-76 b and achieved some of the highest signal-to-noise detections of refractory species in WASP-76 b to date (e.g., Fe I is detected at a SNR of 14.5). We confirm previous observations of an asymmetry in Fe I absorption, but find no measurable ingress-egress asymmetry in Na I and Ca II. Together, these results suggest variations within different layers of the atmosphere of WASP-76 b: neutral metals such as Fe I trace deeper regions with stronger asymmetries, while Na I and Ca II probe regions higher in the atmosphere where the ingress-egress asymmetries are weaker. These findings provide new insights into the complex atmosphere of WASP-76 b and highlight the power of using KPF for atmospheric characterization. More broadly, the KPF SURFS-UP Survey will observe a large sample of UHJs, using transmission, emission, and phase-resolved spectroscopy to characterize their refractory abundances, upper atmospheres, and 3D dynamics."

This paper employs a longitudinal mixed-methods approach to investigate how Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM) have shifted their attitudes toward these platforms between approximately 2013 and 2023. Drawing on archival analysis of online discourses, a quantitative survey of 412 participants, and in-depth semi-structured interviews with 32 participants, we trace the complex trajectory of this evolution. Our findings reveal a clear pattern: from the initial embrace of these applications as revolutionary tools for community building and identity affirmation (2014--2017), to a period of growing ambivalence and critique centered on commercialization, ``hookup culture,'' and multiple forms of discrimination (2017--2020), and finally to the present era (2020--2023), characterized by pragmatic, fragmented, yet simultaneously critical and reconstructive uses. Today, users strategically employ a repertoire of applications -- including global platforms (e.g., Grindr and Tinder), domestic mainstream platforms (e.g., Blued), and niche alternatives (e.g., Aloha) -- to fulfill differentiated needs. We develop a detailed temporal framework to capture this attitudinal evolution and discuss its design implications for creating more supportive, secure, and community-oriented digital environments for marginalized groups."

In recent years, experiments have collected a significant amount of data on the $D_{(s)}$ meson decays, particularly from BESIII, which provides substantial support for theoretical research. In this work, we systematically investigate the semi-leptonic decays of $D_{(s)}$ meson to pseudoscalar (P), scalar (S), vector (V), and axial-vector (A) mesons within the framework of the covariant light-front quark model (CLFQM). We calculate the form factors of the transitions $D_{(s)}\\to P,S,V,A$ and the branching ratios of the corresponding semi-leptonic decays, then compare them with experimental data and results from other theoretical models. The form factor values of the transitions $D_{(s)}\\to P, V$ obtained from the CLFQM are consistent with those of other theoretical models and available data in most cases. However, significant discrepancies are found in some specific $D_{(s)}\\to S,A$ transitions, such as $D\\to a_0(980), a_0(1450)$ and $D_{(s)} \\to K_{1B}$, compared to other theoretical calculations. The predicted branching ratios for the semi-leptonic decays $D\\to P(V)\\ellν_\\ell$ with $\\ell=e,μ$ agree well with experimental data and other theoretical results in most decay channels, validating the reliability of the model. However, for some $D\\to S(V)\\ellν_\\ell$ decays, tension exists among different theoretical predictions and experimental results. Further clarification of such differences is necessary.

In particular, diverse initial solutions are modeled as agents within the consensus ADMM framework. Driving these agents toward consensus facilitates exploration of the nonconvex optimization landscape.

We introduce the Trimmed Configuration Interaction (TrimCI) method, a prior-knowledge-free algorithm that builds accurate ground states directly from random Slater determinants. TrimCI iteratively expands the variational space and trims away unimportant states, allowing a random initial core to self-refine into an accurate approximation of exact ground state. Across challenging benchmarks, TrimCI achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with strikingly efficiency gains of several orders of magnitude. For [4Fe-4S] cluster, it matches recent quantum computing results with $10^6$-fold fewer determinants and CPU-hours. For the nitrogenase P-cluster, it matches selected-CI accuracy using $10^5$-fold fewer determinants. For $8\\times8$ Hubbard model, it recovers over $99\\%$ of the ground-state energy using only $10^{-28}$ of the Hilbert space. In some regimes, TrimCI attains orders-of-magnitude higher accuracy than AFQMC method. These results demonstrate that high-accuracy many-body ground states can be discovered directly from random determinants, establishing TrimCI as a prior-knowledge-free, accurate and highly efficient framework for quantum many-body systems.

Our realism enhancement approach is a zero-shot framework that focuses on preserving the multi-level structures from synthetic videos into the enhanced one in both spatial and temporal domains, built upon a diffusion video foundational model without further fine-tuning. Specifically, we incorporate an effective modification to have the generation/denoising process conditioned on estimated structure-aware information from the synthetic video, such as depth maps, semantic maps, and edge maps, by an auxiliary model, rather than extracting the information from a simulator. This guidance ensures that the enhanced videos are consistent with the original synthetic video at both the structural and semantic levels. Our approach is a simple yet general and powerful approach to enhancing synthetic video realism: we show that our approach outperforms existing baselines in structural consistency with the original video while maintaining state-of-the-art photorealism quality in our experiments."

    "abstract": "Natural Language Interfaces for Databases (NLIDBs) aim to make database querying accessible by allowing users to ask questions in everyday language rather than using formal SQL queries. Despite significant advancements in translation accuracy, critical usability challenges, such as user frustration, query refinement strategies, and error recovery, remain underexplored. To investigate these usability dimensions, we conducted a mixed-method user study comparing SQL-LLM, a state-of-the-art NL2SQL system, with Snowflake, a traditional SQL analytics platform. Our controlled evaluation involved 20 participants completing realistic database querying tasks across 12 queries each. Results show that SQL-LLM significantly reduced query completion times by 10 to 30 percent (mean: 418 s vs. 629 s, p = 0.036) and improved overall accuracy from 50 to 75 percent (p = 0.002). Additionally, participants using SQL-LLM exhibited fewer query reformulations, recovered from errors 30 to 40 seconds faster, and reported lower frustration levels compared to Snowflake users. Behavioral analysis revealed that SQL-LLM encouraged structured, schema-first querying strategies, enhancing user confidence and efficiency, particularly for complex queries. These findings underscore the practical significance of well-designed, user-friendly NLIDBs in business analytics settings, emphasizing the critical role of usability alongside technical accuracy in real-world deployments."

We discuss recommendations on implementing these adaptations, using simulation-based evidence, to give practical advice to practitioners. Reproducible code for the simulations is freely provided."

    "abstract": "Disaster-induced power outages create cascading disruptions across urban lifelines, yet the timed coupling between grid failure and essential service access remains poorly quantified. Focusing on Hurricane Beryl in Houston (2024), this study integrates approximately 173000 15-minute outage records with over 1.25 million visits to 3187 food facilities to quantify how infrastructure performance and human access co-evolve. We construct daily indices for outage characteristics (intensity, duration) and food access metrics (redundancy, frequency, proximity), estimate cross-system lags through lagged correlations over zero to seven days, and identify recovery patterns using DTW k-means clustering. Overlaying these clusters yields compound power-access typologies and enables facility-level criticality screening. The analysis reveals a consistent two-day lag: food access reaches its nadir on July 8 at landfall while outage severity peaks around July 10, with negative correlations strongest at a two-day lag and losing significance by day four. We identify four compound typologies from high/low outage crossed with high/low access disruption levels. Road network sparsity, more than income, determines the depth and persistence of access loss. Through this analysis, we enumerate 294 critical food facilities in the study area requiring targeted continuity measures including backup power, microgrids, and feeder prioritization. The novelty lies in measuring interdependency at daily operational resolution while bridging scales from communities to individual facilities, converting dynamic coupling patterns into actionable interventions for phase-sensitive restoration and equity-aware preparedness. The framework is transferable to other lifelines and hazards, offering a generalizable template for diagnosing and mitigating cascading effects on community access during disaster recovery."

By combining some powerful techniques developed in the last years, we prove that each unique gapped ground state is short-range entangled: It can be mapped into a product state by a finite time evolution map generated by a Hamiltonian with exponentially quasi-local interaction terms. This claim makes precise the common belief that one-dimensional gapped systems are topologically trivial in the bulk."

Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) can be a powerful tool for simulating the details of star cluster formation and gas dispersal by stellar feedback. Zooming in from galactic to local scales using the star cluster formation simulation package Torch requires transferring simulation data from one scale to the other. Therefore, we introduce VorAMR, a novel computational tool that interpolates data from an unstructured Voronoi mesh to an AMR Cartesian grid. VorAMR is integrated into the Torch package, which integrates the FLASH AMR magnetohydrodynamics code into the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment. VorAMR interpolates data from an AREPO simulation to a FLASH AMR grid using a nearest-neighbor particle scheme, which can then be evolved within the Torch package, representing the first ever transfer of data from a Voronoi mesh to an AMR Cartesian grid. Interpolation from one numerical representation to another results in an error of a few percent in global mass and energy conservation, which could be reduced with higher-order interpolation of the Voronoi cells. We show that the postinterpolation Torch simulation evolves without numerical abnormalities. A preliminary Torch simulation is evolved for 3.22 Myr and compared to the original AREPO simulation over the same time period. We observe similarly distributed star cluster formation between the two simulations. More compact clusters are produced in the Torch simulation as well as 2.3 times as much stellar material as in AREPO, likely due to the differences in resolution."

    "abstract": "Attention is the brain's ability to selectively focus on a few specific aspects while ignoring irrelevant ones. This biological principle inspired the attention mechanism in modern Transformers. Transformers now underpin large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, but at the cost of massive training and inference energy, leading to a large carbon footprint. While brain attention emerges from neural circuits, Transformer attention relies on dot-product similarity to weight elements in the input sequence. Neuromorphic computing, especially spiking neural networks (SNNs), offers a brain-inspired path to energy-efficient intelligence. Despite recent work on attention-based spiking Transformers, the core attention layer remains non-neuromorphic. Current spiking attention (i) relies on dot-product or element-wise similarity suited to floating-point operations, not event-driven spikes; (ii) keeps attention matrices that suffer from the von Neumann bottleneck, limiting in-memory computing; and (iii) still diverges from brain-like computation. To address these issues, we propose the Spiking STDP Transformer (S$^{2}$TDPT), a neuromorphic Transformer that implements self-attention through spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), embedding query--key correlations in synaptic weights. STDP, a core mechanism of memory and learning in the brain and widely studied in neuromorphic devices, naturally enables in-memory computing and supports non-von Neumann hardware. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, our model achieves 94.35\\% and 78.08\\% accuracy with only four timesteps and 0.49 mJ on CIFAR-100, an 88.47\\% energy reduction compared to a standard ANN Transformer. Grad-CAM shows that the model attends to semantically relevant regions, enhancing interpretability. Overall, S$^{2}$TDPT illustrates how biologically inspired attention can yield energy-efficient, hardware-friendly, and explainable neuromorphic models."

Performance was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Standard Deviation (SD), and Median Absolute Error (MedAE). Based on this study, we conclude that input image resolution has a clear and consistent impact on the accuracy of age estimation in both DeepFace and InsightFace. Both frameworks achieve optimal performance at 224x224 pixels, with an MAE of 10.83 years (DeepFace) and 7.46 years (InsightFace). At low resolutions, MAE increases substantially, while very high resolutions also degrade accuracy. InsightFace is consistently faster than DeepFace across all resolutions."

    "abstract": "Global sensitivity metrics are essential tools for assessing parameter importance in complex models, particularly when precise information about parameter values is unavailable. In many cases, such metrics are used to provide parameter rankings that allow for necessary dimension reduction in moderate-to-high dimensional systems. However, globally-derived sensitivity results may obscure localized variability in parameter sensitivities, resulting in misleading conclusions about parameter importance and ensuing consequences for subsequent tasks such as model calibration and surrogate model construction. In this study, we illustrate how discrepancies between globally- and locally-based sensitivity information may arise for an emerging sensitivity metric based on active subspace methodology, as well as for other commonly used sensitivity techniques. In response, we outline a framework that exploits the active subspace to evaluate the stability of parameter sensitivities over the admissible parameter space. This analysis allows one to determine the subregions of the parameter space in which a globally-derived sensitivity metric may be trustworthy. The proposed framework is illustrated on a collection of simple examples for ease of visualization, as well as the highly-applicable Lotka-Volterra model, for which we demonstrate how these issues may be exacerbated in higher dimensions. Our findings suggest that globally-derived sensitivity information should be treated with caution, and that incorporating analysis on local subregions may improve robustness and accuracy in downstream modeling tasks."

Specifically, \\texttt{SMRC} formulates student reasoning as a multi-step sequential decision problem and introduces Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore optimal correction paths. To reduce the cost of the annotating process-level rewards, we leverage breadth-first search (BFS) guided by LLMs and final-answer evaluation to generate reward signals, which are then distributed across intermediate reasoning steps via a back-propagation mechanism, enabling fine-grained process supervision. Additionally, we construct a benchmark for high school mathematics, MSEB (Multi-Solution Error Benchmark), consisting of 158 instances that include problem statements, student solutions, and correct reasoning steps. We further propose a dual evaluation protocol centered on \\textbf{solution accuracy} and \\textbf{correct-step retention}, offering a comprehensive measure of educational applicability. Experiments demonstrate that \\texttt{SMRC} significantly outperforms existing methods on two public datasets (ProcessBench and MR-GSM8K) and our MSEB in terms of effectiveness and overall performance.

In particular, the observed currents neither discern equilibrium from non-equilibrium nor can they be used in extant estimators of entropy production. Our strategy to eliminate these effects is based on formally attributing the blackouts to a second channel connecting states. The unknown frequency of blackouts and the true underlying transition rates can be determined from the short-time limit of observed waiting-time distributions. A post-modification of observed trajectory data yields a virtual effective dynamics from which the lower bound on entropy production based on thermodynamic uncertainty relations can be recovered fully. Moreover, the post-processed data can be used in waiting-time based estimators. Crucially, our strategy does neither require the blackouts to occur homogeneously nor symmetrically under time-reversal."

We show that the standard DPS results are biased, but they can be easily corrected by scaling the log-likelihood score during the diffusion process, yielding unbiased results with proper uncertainty quantification.

    "abstract": "Multi-robot systems are increasingly being used for critical applications such as rescuing injured people, delivering food and medicines, and monitoring key areas. These applications usually involve navigating at high speeds through constrained spaces such as small gaps. Navigating such constrained spaces becomes particularly challenging when the space is crowded with multiple heterogeneous agents all of which have urgent priorities. What makes the problem even harder is that during an active response situation, roles and priorities can quickly change on a dime without informing the other agents. In order to complete missions in such environments, robots must not only be safe, but also agile, able to dodge and change course at a moment's notice. In this paper, we propose FACA, a fair and agile collision avoidance approach where robots coordinate their tasks by talking to each other via natural language (just as people do). In FACA, robots balance safety with agility via a novel artificial potential field algorithm that creates an automatic ``roundabout'' effect whenever a conflict arises. Our experiments show that FACA achieves a improvement in efficiency, completing missions more than 3.5X faster than baselines with a time reduction of over 70% while maintaining robust safety margins."

In the PINN framework, the governing partial differential equations, along with initial and boundary conditions, are encoded directly into the loss function, enabling the network to learn solutions that are consistent with the underlying physics. In this work, we employ the PINN framework to solve the dimensionless Navier-Stokes equations for three two-dimensional incompressible, steady, laminar flow problems without using any labeled data. The boundary and initial conditions are enforced in a hard manner, ensuring they are satisfied exactly rather than penalized during training. We validate the PINN predicted velocity profiles, drag coefficients and pressure profiles against the conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for moderate to high values of Reynolds number ($Re$). It is observed that the PINN predictions show good agreement with the CFD results at lower $Re$. We also extend our analysis to a transient condition and find that our method is equally capable of simulating complex time-dependent flow dynamics. To quantitatively assess the accuracy, we compute the $L_2$ normalized error, which lies in the range $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ - $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$ for our chosen case studies."

For evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark across ten datasets, covering clean and corrupted image recognition, texture-shape cue conflict tests, silhouette recognition, depth-order classification, and the visual cliff paradigm. All CATDiet variants demonstrate enhanced robustness in object recognition, despite being trained solely on object-centric videos. Remarkably, models also exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns, including neural plasticity changes mirroring synaptic density in macaque V1 and behaviors resembling infants' visual cliff responses. Building on these insights, CombDiet initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training while preserving temporal continuity. Trained on object-centric or head-mounted infant videos, CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception. Together, these results suggest that the developmental progression of early infant visual experience offers a powerful reverse-engineering framework for understanding the emergence of robust visual intelligence in machines.

For lattice refinement, we compute Hartree-Fock nuclear states for a central Woods-Saxon potential in three dimensions, and we compute bound states and continuum states in a multi-species Hubbard model of fermions in one dimension. In all cases, the method is efficient and requires an adiabatic evolution time comparable to the inverse of the energy gap in the physical spectrum."

We study the RM signal from the Shapley Supercluster Core (SSC), in order to constrain the magnetic field properties of the gas. The SSC region consists of two galaxy clusters A3558 and A3562, and two galaxy groups between them, at $z\\simeq 0.048$. We combine RM Grid data with thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect data, obtained from the POSSUM pilot survey, and Planck, respectively. To robustly determine the gas density, its magnetic field properties, and their correlation, we study the RM scatter in the SSC region and its behavior as a function of distance to the nearest cluster/group. We compare observational results with semi-analytic Gaussian random field models and more realistic cosmological MHD simulations. With a sky-density of 36 RMs/deg$^{2}$, we detect an excess RM scatter of $30.5\\pm 4.6 \\, \\mathrm{rad/m^2}$ in the SSC region. Comparing with models, we find an average magnetic field strength of 1-3 $μ$G (in the groups and clusters). The RM scatter profile, derived from data ranging from 0.3-1.8 $r_{500}$ for all objects, is systematically flatter than expected compared to models, with $η<0.5$ being favored. Despite this discrepancy, we find that cosmological MHD simulations matched to the SSC structure most closely align with scenarios where the magnetic field is amplified by the turbulent velocity in the intercluster regions on scales $\\lesssim 0.8\\,r_{500}$. The dense RM grid and precision provided by POSSUM allows us to probe magnetized gas in the SSC clusters and groups on scales within and beyond their $r_{500}$. Flatter-than-expected RM scatter profiles reveal a significant challenge in reconciling observations with even the most realistic predictions from cosmological MHD simulations in the outskirts of interacting clusters."

Our computationally efficient hybrid approach separates the prediction: (1) kernel ridge regression learns the nonlinear map from past trajectories, and (2) analytical linearization of the kernel map approximates the effect of future inputs. This linearization is key, allowing the controller to be formulated as a standard Quadratic Program (QP) for efficient real-time implementation. Offset-free tracking is inherently achieved by using input increments. We provide theoretical guarantees for recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability. The algorithm is validated on a nonlinear Van der Pol oscillator, where it successfully rejects unmeasured disturbances and eliminates steady-state errors, outperforming a standard model-based controller."

If the coupling of the mediators to the Standard Model is feeble, but the coupling to the dark matter is large enough, the dark sector may reach equilibrium at a temperature distinct from that of the thermal bath. The relic density is then said to be obtained via decoupled freeze out (DFO). We focus on the $s$-wave annihilation scenario, which particularly benefits from the DFO mechanism by evading standard CMB limits while still yielding indirect detection signals. We calculate the relic density by solving a set of four coupled Boltzmann equations for the number densities of the dark sector particles and the energy transfer from the light to dark sector. We finally perform a thorough analysis of experimental bounds on this scenario, namely from indirect detection and the CMB, as well as from BBN, and find that, while there are considerable constraints on the parameter space where the correct relic density is obtained, a viable region remains to be explored."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in optimizing Gaussian Splatting for scene geometry have enabled efficient reconstruction of detailed surfaces from images. However, when input views are sparse, such optimization is prone to overfitting, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality. Existing approaches address this challenge by employing flattened Gaussian primitives to better fit surface geometry, combined with depth regularization to alleviate geometric ambiguities under limited viewpoints. Nevertheless, the increased anisotropy inherent in flattened Gaussians exacerbates overfitting in sparse-view scenarios, hindering accurate surface fitting and degrading novel view synthesis performance. In this paper, we propose \\net{}, a method that reconstructs more accurate and detailed surfaces while preserving high-quality novel view rendering. Our key insight is to introduce Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment, which bridges rendering quality and geometry estimation, thereby jointly enhancing both surface reconstruction and view synthesis. In addition, we present a Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency by incorporating both training and unseen views, effectively mitigating overfitting caused by sparse supervision. Extensive experiments on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance."

We address this question by showing how the shape of Lyapunov comparison functions governs guaranteed decay for control affine systems. Using a windowed nominal exponential rate together with the endpoint cap induced by actuator limits, we establish a strict ordering: concave comparison functions strictly outperform linear and convex ones, and strict concavity is necessary to improve the best achievable global exponential rate under a fixed endpoint cap. We derive a computable lower bound on the required actuation level for a target nominal rate and show that only concave shaping can reduce this level under the endpoint cap. We then establish a feasibility-preserving acceleration result: whenever a margin exists on a sublevel set, a feasible linear comparison can be replaced by a concave one that preserves feasibility while strictly increasing the guaranteed windowed decay. Finally, we give a tunable rational concave factor with controlled slope that yields a constructive design and integrates with CLF QP, as illustrated by examples."

We validate the framework through circuit simulations, finite-element modeling, and experimental measurements of van der Waals parallel-plate capacitors, using it to extract the dielectric constant and loss tangent of hexagonal boron nitride. Statistical analysis across multiple reference resonators, together with multimode self-calibration, demonstrates consistent and reproducible extraction of both capacitance and loss tangent in close agreement with literature values. In addition to parameter extraction, the analytic relations provide practical design guidelines for maximizing energy participation ratio in the load and improving the precision of resonator-based material metrology."

We find, that a self-consistent consideration of the ferromagnetic fluctuations within the D-TRILEX approach results in the splitting of the electronic spectral function at low temperatures. This splitting exhibits only a weak momentum dependence, and only one of the split bands crosses the Fermi level. As a result, the Fermi surface itself remains unsplit, but its area increases, reflecting the presence of non-Fermi-liquid electronic excitations. We show that both the self-consistent account of the non-local contributions to the electronic self-energy and the proper treatment of electron interaction vertices in D-TRILEX are important to obtain this behaviour."

    "abstract": "In the Chilean local alcohol industry (pisco indus- try), for one liter of alcohol produced 10-15 liters of vinasse as the main wastewater of the process. To comply with industrial waste regulations, vinasse must be stored, which enables evaporation, leaving behind a residual sludge. However, treating vinasse remains an environmental and industrial challenge, having a high nutrient concentration and acidity that can degrade soil quality and harm surrounding vegetation. While previous studies have modeled sludge generation and transport in urban water systems, research on industrial wastewater, such as the alcohol industry, remains limited, affecting the search for opportunities to improve the treatment process.. This paper proposes a System Dynamics Model (SDM) to assess the costs associated with three management strategies: natural drying of vinasse, relocation to an alternative site, and implementation of a coagulation- flocculation treatment to accelerate sludge production. This paper makes two contributions. First, we describe a pioneer SDM applicable to sludge management, which includes variables such as sludge transport, coagulant quantity, and ambient temperature to make hypothetical scenarios that affect the treatment processes of vinasse. Second, we present the expected results of the associated costs of the scenarios proposed in the model, helping decision-makers to manage vinasse. The model is calibrated with historical data provided by a company in the North of Chile, helping to improve the decision-making for vinasse treatment."

The crystal was prepared with optical-grade surfaces and enclosed in a multi layer shielding system to suppress ambient light and background radiation. The detector response was studied at temperatures ranging from 100 K to room temperature. A figure of merit, defined as the ratio of the 59.5 keV peak position to the baseline resolution, showed a maximum at 175 K, indicating optimal photon detection efficiency. Pulse shape analysis demonstrated temperature-dependent variations in scintillation decay. At 175 K, the baseline resolution was sigma ~ 1 keV, corresponding to an effective threshold of ~ 3 keV. These results confirm the capability of the CsI(Tl) SiPM system to operate at low thresholds for rare-event searches and low-energy particle detection."

Both the Drude-type components and overdamped excitations have been separated and analyzed. An additional absorption band observed above 200 cm-1 in these RB12 with magnetic RE ions is attributed to the cooperative Jahn-Teller dynamics of the B12 complexes, which depends crucially on the RE-ion cage space and is compared with the same effect found in the non-magnetic LuB12 and ZrB12. It was shown that non-equilibrium (hot) electrons participating in the formation of the collective JT modes dominate in charge transport, and portion of Drude-type carriers changes by 20-40% in these compounds with unstable boron lattice. Strong renormalization of the infrared response is observed in Tm1-xYbxB12 solid solutions with metal-insulator transition (MIT) and is discussed in terms of localized collective modes caused by Yb-ion valence instability. We demonstrate that even at room temperature the MIT is accompanied with simultaneous decrease in concentration of Drude-type electrons and redistribution of carriers to localized JT collective modes."

    "abstract": "We investigate the impact of the Bondi--Hoyle--Lyttleton (BHL) accretion mechanism on the evolution of nova eruptions in symbiotic systems by systematically varying three key input parameters: the initial donor (asymptotic giant branch; AGB) mass, the initial white dwarf (WD) mass, and the initial binary separation ($a$). We explore models with AGB masses in the range $1.5$--$3.5\\,{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$, WD masses in the range $0.7$--$1.25\\,{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$, and separations in the range $1$--$8\\,{\\rm kR_{\\odot}}$. We find that all models exhibit a significant long-term orbital increase. This trend is primarily driven by the fact that approximately $99\\%$ of the AGB mass is lost from the system, either directly via a wind that is not accreted by the WD, or accreted onto the WD and subsequently ejected during nova eruptions. As a result, the secular orbital response to mass loss or mass transfer dominates over angular-momentum-loss sinks that could otherwise shrink the orbit, producing a consistent orbital widening. Consequently, all WD masses gradually decrease with time. More massive WDs achieve higher mass-transfer efficiencies and accretion rates, leading to slightly higher mass-retention efficiencies per nova. However, because higher accretion rates also produce more frequent eruptions, the total WD mass lost over the AGB lifetime is larger in these systems. We conclude that symbiotic systems transferring mass via the BHL mechanism are unlikely to be viable progenitors of Type Ia supernovae."

    "abstract": "Neutrino oscillations, a quantum effect manifesting at macroscopic scales, are governed by lepton flavor mixing angles and neutrino mass-squared differences that are fundamental parameters of particle physics, representing phenomena beyond the Standard Model. Precision measurements of these parameters are essential for testing the completeness of the three-flavor framework, determining the mass ordering of neutrinos, and probing possible new physics. The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is a 20 kton liquid-scintillator detector located 52.5 km from multiple reactor cores, designed to resolve the interference pattern of reactor neutrinos with sub-percent precision. Here we report, using the first 59.1 days of data collected since detector completion in August 2025, the first simultaneous high-precision determination of two neutrino oscillation parameters, $\\sin^2 θ_{12} = 0.3092\\,\\pm\\,0.0087$ and $Δm^2_{21} = (7.50\\,\\pm\\,0.12)\\times10^{-5}\\;{\\rm eV}^2$ for the normal mass ordering scenario, improving the precision by a factor of 1.6 relative to the combination of all previous measurements. These results advance the basic understanding of neutrinos, validate the detector's design, and confirm JUNO's readiness for its primary goal of resolving the neutrino mass ordering with a larger dataset. The rapid achievement with a short exposure highlights JUNO's potential to push the frontiers of precision neutrino physics and paves the way for its broad scientific program."

    "abstract": "The text points out that one of the main contradictions of quantum realism, which is particularly relevant to the social sciences, is the tension between the existence of an observer-independent reality and the idea that this reality is mediated by the cognitive and interpretative processes of the subject. This contradiction arises from the central role of the observer in phenomena such as the collapse of the wave function and their influence on the construction of reality, which challenges the classical notion of an objective, non-perceptual nature. Moreover, the encounter between social realism and social interpretivism lies in the fact that, in the social sciences, it is also recognized that human interpretations and actions shape social reality, creating a scenario in which absolute objectivity becomes difficult to sustain. These tensions, therefore enrich the epistemological and ontological debate, showing that the contradictions of quantum realism transcend physics and connect deeply with the difficulties and dynamics of the social construction of reality."

This result enables a systematic investigation of the commutative formulation of the corresponding Lagrangian. In the SU($N$) sector, the map introduces a non-local operator. In contrast, in the U(1) sector, this non-locality can be removed. This contrast suggests that the essential source of non-local behavior lies in the non-Abelian degrees of freedom. The commutative description obtained here offers further insight into both the Dirac-Born-Infeld structure and its possible extensions to the dynamics of M5-branes."

    "abstract": "Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a promising method for editing pre-trained \\textit{open-vocabulary} models, offering a cost-effective alternative to standard multi-task fine-tuning. However, despite the abundance of \\textit{closed-vocabulary} models that are not pre-trained with language supervision, applying task arithmetic to these models remains unexplored. In this paper, we deploy and study task addition in closed-vocabulary image classification models. We consider different pre-training schemes and find that \\textit{weight disentanglement} -- the property enabling task arithmetic -- is a general consequence of pre-training, as it appears in different pre-trained closed-vocabulary models. In fact, we find that pre-trained closed-vocabulary vision transformers can also be edited with task arithmetic, achieving high task addition performance and enabling the efficient deployment of multi-task models. Finally, we demonstrate that simple linear probing is a competitive baseline to task addition. Overall, our findings expand the applicability of task arithmetic to a broader class of pre-trained models and open the way for more efficient use of pre-trained models in diverse settings."

SweeperBot answers SR users' visual questions by combining an optimal view selection technique with the strength of generative- and recognition-based foundation models. An expert review with 10 Blind and Low-Vision (BLV) users with SR experience demonstrated the feasibility of using SweeperBot to assist BLV users in exploring and comparing 3D models. The quality of the descriptions generated by SweeperBot was validated by a second survey study with 30 sighted participants."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "Robots can adapt to user preferences by learning reward functions from demonstrations, but with limited data, reward models often overfit to spurious correlations and fail to generalize. This happens because demonstrations show robots how to do a task but not what matters for that task, causing the model to focus on irrelevant state details. Natural language can more directly specify what the robot should focus on, and, in principle, disambiguate between many reward functions consistent with the demonstrations. However, existing language-conditioned reward learning methods typically treat instructions as simple conditioning signals, without fully exploiting their potential to resolve ambiguity. Moreover, real instructions are often ambiguous themselves, so naive conditioning is unreliable. Our key insight is that these two input types carry complementary information: demonstrations show how to act, while language specifies what is important. We propose Masked Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Masked IRL), a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to combine the strengths of both input types. Masked IRL infers state-relevance masks from language instructions and enforces invariance to irrelevant state components. When instructions are ambiguous, it uses LLM reasoning to clarify them in the context of the demonstrations. In simulation and on a real robot, Masked IRL outperforms prior language-conditioned IRL methods by up to 15% while using up to 4.7 times less data, demonstrating improved sample-efficiency, generalization, and robustness to ambiguous language.

    "abstract": "Thermal neutron detectors are crucial to a wide range of applications, including nuclear safety and security, cancer treatment, space research, non-destructive testing, and more. However, neutrons are notoriously difficult to capture due to their absence of charge, and only a handful of isotopes have a sufficient neutron cross-section. Meanwhile, commercially available $^3$He gas filled proportional counters suffer from depleting $^3$He feedstocks and complex device structures. In this work, we explore the potential of a carborane containing conjugated polymer ($o$CbT$_2$-NDI) as a thermal neutron detector. The natural abundance of $^{10}$B in such a polymer enables intrinsic thermal neutron capture of the material, making it the first demonstration of an organic semiconductor with such capabilities. In addition, we show that thermal neutron detection can be achieved also by adding a $^{10}$B$_4$C sensitiser additive to the analogous carborane-free polymer PNDI(2OD)2T, whereas unsensitised PNDI(2OD)2T control devices only respond to the fast neutron component of the radiation field. This approach allows us to disentangle the fast and thermal neutron responses of the devices tested and compare the relative performance of the two approaches to thermal neutron detection. Both the carborane containing and the $^{10}$B$_4$C sensitised devices displayed enhancement due to thermal neutrons, above that of the unsensitised polymer. The detector response is found to be linear with flux up to $1.796\\,\\times\\,10^7\\,$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ n$_{th}\\bar{v}$ and saturates at high drive biases. This study demonstrates the viability of carboranyl polymers as neutron detectors, highlights the inherent chemical tuneability of organic semiconductors, and opens the possibility of their application to a number of different low-cost, scalable, and easily processable detector technologies."

In the first part, we establish a minimax lower bound for this estimation problem, using an approach tailored to second-order properties of spatial point processes. Although not the main focus, this methodology also extends naturally to a minimax lower bound for the estimation of the pair correlation function of spatial point processes. In the second part, we construct a multitaper estimator that achieves the optimal rate of convergence in squared risk. Under a Brillinger-mixing condition, we further establish a chi-square-type concentration bound. Finally, we propose a data-driven procedure for selecting the number of tapers, supported by an oracle inequality, and we demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the method through numerical experiments."

As a consequence, the effective dimension depends on the physical state of the system. Interestingly, systems of this form exhibit enhanced symmetries compared to their fixed-dimensional counterparts. As an explicit example, we analyze a harmonic oscillator for which the spatial dimension is represented by a quantum operator. By evaluating the corresponding partition function, we uncover a temperature-dependent effective dimension. Our framework opens a new avenue for constructing physical systems, from gravity to condensed matter, where the very notion of dimensionality becomes quantum."

    "abstract": "Dimensionality Reduction (DR) techniques are commonly used for the visual exploration and analysis of high-dimensional data due to their ability to project datasets of high-dimensional points onto the 2D plane. However, projecting datasets in lower dimensions often entails some distortion, which is not necessarily easy to recognize but can lead users to misleading conclusions. Several Projection Quality Metrics (PQMs) have been developed as tools to quantify the goodness-of-fit of a DR projection; however, they mostly focus on measuring how well the projection captures the global or local structure of the data, without taking into account the visual distortion of the resulting plots, thus often ignoring the presence of outliers or artifacts that can mislead a visual analysis of the projection. In this work, we introduce the Warping Index (WI), a new metric for measuring the quality of DR projections onto the 2D plane, based on the assumption that the correct preservation of empty regions between points is of crucial importance towards a faithful visual representation of the data."

We propose a matroidal generalization of the problem to oriented matroids, concerning exchange sequences between bases under sign constraints on elements appearing in certain fundamental circuits. We formulate a conjecture on the minimum length of such a sequence, and prove it for oriented graphic matroids of directed graphs. We also study connections between our conjecture and several long-standing open problems on exchange sequences between pairs of bases in unoriented matroids."

    "abstract": "Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) is widely used as an imaging solution to aid diagnosis and other clinical tasks. However, this comes at the price of a deterioration in image quality due to the low dose of radiation used to reduce the risk of secondary cancer development. While some efficient methods have been proposed to enhance LDCT quality, many overestimate noise and perform excessive smoothing, leading to a loss of critical details. In this paper, we introduce D-PerceptCT, a novel architecture inspired by key principles of the Human Visual System (HVS) to enhance LDCT images. The objective is to guide the model to enhance or preserve perceptually relevant features, thereby providing radiologists with CT images where critical anatomical structures and fine pathological details are perceptu- ally visible. D-PerceptCT consists of two main blocks: 1) a Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex), which integrates semantic priors from a pretrained DINOv2 model with local spatial features, allowing the network to incorporate semantic-awareness during enhancement; (2) a Global-Local State-Space block that captures long-range information and multiscale features to preserve the important structures and fine details for diagnosis. In addition, we propose a novel deep perceptual loss, designated as the Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF), which is inspired by human contrast sensitivity, to further emphasize perceptually important features. Extensive experiments on the Mayo2016 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of D-PerceptCT method for LDCT enhancement, showing better preservation of structural and textural information within LDCT images compared to SOTA methods."

    "abstract": "Reconstructing protein-protein interaction networks is a central challenge in network medicine, often addressed using link prediction algorithms. Recent studies suggest that quantum walk-based approaches hold promise for this task. In this paper, we build on these algorithms by introducing chirality through the addition of random phases in the Hamiltonian generators. The resulting additional degrees of freedom enable a more diverse exploration of the network, which we exploit by employing a swarm of chiral quantum walks. Thus, we enhance the predictive power of quantum walks on complex networks. Indeed, compared to a non-chiral algorithm, the chiral version exhibits greater robustness, making its performance less dependent on the optimal evolution time--a critical hyperparameter of the non-chiral model. This improvement arises from complementary dynamics introduced by chirality within the swarm. By analyzing multiple phase-sampling strategies, we identify configurations that achieve a practical trade-off: retaining the high predictive accuracy of the non-chiral algorithm at its optimal time while gaining the robustness typical of chirality. Our findings highlight the versatility of chiral quantum walks and their potential to outperform both classical and non-chiral quantum methods in realistic scenarios, including comparisons between successive versions of evolving databases."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "The displacement current, introduced by Maxwell, has led to persistent confusion regarding its role in generating magnetic fields. To find a new way to understand classical magnetism, in this work, the displacement current is first decomposed into a localized internal part and an external field component by developing a discal regularization over the dipole distribution. Due to a surprising cancellation of the electric current by the internal displacement current, the magnetic field in the Coulomb gauge can be reformulated, in terms of the external component of the displacement current, as an instantaneous Biot-Savart law. The new expression allows for a reinterpretation of the generation of magnetic fields, viewing it as a magnetic effect related to the external displacement current, rather than directly to the electric current. The consistency of the Biot-Savart law with the Ampère-Maxwell law is thus confirmed, eliminating a dogged dispute in history. This result offers a potential recognition of the displacement current enigma. The regularization method is also applied to the polarization model to develop and refine the Clausius-Mossotti equation within the special Wigner-Seitz primitive-cell regularization."

However, it is hardly known that in 1714 at the age of sixteen MacLaurin penned a short manuscript wherein he tried to apply Newtonian principles to morality, in an approach to mathematization that suggests strong continuities with earlier centuries. De viribus mentium bonipetis (On the good-seeking forces of minds) remained unpublished and hidden in the papers of the Colin Campbell Collection at the University of Edinburgh for over 250 years; it was only uncovered at the end of the twentieth century. De viribus provides a remarkable glimpse into how the young MacLaurin dealt with early Newtonianism, the tenets of the Church of Scotland, and the nascent interface between science and religion just prior to the dawn of the Scottish Enlightenment. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of De viribus is the personal snippets related to Scottish Presbyterian morality that MacLaurin interjects throughout his mathematical discussion. These are often vague and oblique, and one must look to his mathematics, his contemporaries, and the social fabric of his surroundings to understand them. In the process, one gains insight not only into MacLaurin's family background and personal religious thought, but also into the culture and nature of teaching in Scottish universities at the time. De Viribus not only demonstrates that ideas of mathematising morality were being canvassed in Scotland much earlier than the better known, but less sophisticated, later attempts by the likes of Frances Hutcheson, David Hume and George Turnbull, but suggests continuities with approaches to mathematization in earlier centuries, providing a strong bridge into the Enlightenment era."

To bridge this gap, we develop nnterp, a lightweight wrapper around NNsight that provides a unified interface for transformer analysis while preserving original HuggingFace implementations. Through automatic module renaming and comprehensive validation testing, nnterp enables researchers to write intervention code once and deploy it across 50+ model variants spanning 16 architecture families. The library includes built-in implementations of common interpretability methods (logit lens, patchscope, activation steering) and provides direct access to attention probabilities for models that support it. By packaging validation tests with the library, researchers can verify compatibility with custom models locally. nnterp bridges the gap between correctness and usability in mechanistic interpretability tooling."

We fabricate (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ Hall bars with a thicknesses of 6 and 9 nm and measure an insulating phase around the Dirac point for low bias and at sub-Kelvin temperatures only in samples fabricated from the 6 nm films, which indicates the presence of a hybridization gap.

Complementarily, the Image Refiner identifies perceptual gaps between generated images and user intentions, strategically reducing the visual-semantic discrepancy. By leveraging multi-turn dialogues, DIR-TIR provides superior controllability and fault tolerance compared to conventional single-query methods, significantly improving target image hit accuracy.

The ejecta shows a pronounced asymmetry and, assuming uniform distribution, an average thickness limit of $\\sim 2$ mm. Spectral analysis using WAC images reveals a consistent reddening of the central ejecta region, with an average 16.54 % increase in spectral slope between 321 nm and 643 nm, marking the first reported detection of color changes resulting from a lunar impact. We evaluated several scaling laws and found that the Gault et al. (1974) formulation most accurately reproduces the observed crater size. Furthermore, luminous efficiency values below $η= 2 \\times 10^{-3}$ and higher projectile densities are most consistent with the morphology of the ejecta. The impact direction inferred from this pattern is not compatible with the radiant of the September $\\varepsilon$-Perseids stream. Moreover, an independent probability analysis yields a greater than 96 % likelihood that the event was caused by a sporadic meteoroid. Our results also demonstrate the potential of WAC imagery for the automated detection of new lunar craters, which can improve statistical estimates of the current impact flux. This methodology offers a powerful complement to high-resolution imaging, with important implications for both lunar safety and planetary defense."

Modeling the spacetime geometry as a black hole embedded within various DM distributions, including those with a central density spike, we demonstrate that the presence of a DM halo, particularly one that is massive and compact, enhances the luminosity of the accretion disk. The dominant contribution to this luminosity originates from the inner regions of the flow, suggesting that luminosity measurements could serve as a valuable observational probe for the dense DM environments expected near galactic centers."

    "abstract": "In decentralized machine learning paradigms such as Split Federated Learning (SFL) and its variant U-shaped SFL, the server's capabilities are severely restricted. Although this enhances client-side privacy, it also leaves the server highly vulnerable to model theft by malicious clients. Ensuring intellectual property protection for such capability-limited servers presents a dual challenge: watermarking schemes that depend on client cooperation are unreliable in adversarial settings, whereas traditional server-side watermarking schemes are technically infeasible because the server lacks access to critical elements such as model parameters or labels. To address this challenge, this paper proposes Sigil, a mandatory watermarking framework designed specifically for capability-limited servers. Sigil defines the watermark as a statistical constraint on the server-visible activation space and embeds the watermark into the client model via gradient injection, without requiring any knowledge of the data. Besides, we design an adaptive gradient clipping mechanism to ensure that our watermarking process remains both mandatory and stealthy, effectively countering existing gradient anomaly detection methods and a specifically designed adaptive subspace removal attack. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrate Sigil's fidelity, robustness, and stealthiness."

    "abstract": "The diffusive behavior of small entities is strongly influenced by the flow of the surrounding medium, which is ubiquitous in natural and artificial environments. In this study, we investigate the transport characteristics of the inertial active Brownian particles (ABPs) in a microfluidic channel under a Poiseuille flow. The interplay between the inertia of the particles and the imposed fluid flow leads to interesting diffusive behaviors. For instance, in the overdamped regime ($m \\to 0$), particles exhibit a negative average velocity $\\langle v \\rangle$ due to upstream movement. As $m$ increases, particles tend to move along the flow direction with an increase in $\\langle v \\rangle$ in the positive direction, exhibiting a maximum at optimal $m$, and diminish for higher $m$ values. The effective diffusion coefficient $D_{eff}$ also shows a peak at this optimal $m$. Interestingly, at higher $m$ values, $D_{eff}$ decreases with increasing the noise strength. The self-propelled velocity of the particles further enhances the upstream movement. Further, the rotation rate of the particles also contributes positively to the upstream motion, and enhances the diffusion of the particles by many orders in the limit of higher $m$. This study reveals that inertia not only modifies swimmer flow interactions but also enables new dynamical regimes, where mass-dependent trajectories can be harnessed for selective control. Such control holds promise for mass based particle separation in precisely engineered environments and lab on a chip devices for technological applications."

Common approaches to ARC treat it as a language-oriented problem, addressed by large language models (LLMs) or recurrent reasoning models. However, although the puzzle-like tasks in ARC are inherently visual, existing research has rarely approached the problem from a vision-centric perspective. In this work, we formulate ARC within a vision paradigm, framing it as an image-to-image translation problem. To incorporate visual priors, we represent the inputs on a \"canvas\" that can be processed like natural images. It is then natural for us to apply standard vision architectures, such as a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT), to perform image-to-image mapping. Our model is trained from scratch solely on ARC data and generalizes to unseen tasks through test-time training. Our framework, termed Vision ARC (VARC), achieves 60.4% accuracy on the ARC-1 benchmark, substantially outperforming existing methods that are also trained from scratch. Our results are competitive with those of leading LLMs and close the gap to average human performance."

We first introduce an interface, HMC-Controller, for blending actions from different control profiles continuously in the torque space. HMC-Controller facilitates both teleoperation and policy deployment. Then, to learn a robust force-aware policy, we propose HMC-Policy to unify different controllers into a heterogeneous architecture. We adopt a mixture-of-experts style routing to learn from large-scale position-only data and fine-grained force-aware demonstrations. Experiments on a real humanoid robot show over 50% relative improvement vs. baselines on challenging tasks such as compliant table wiping and drawer opening, demonstrating the efficacy of HMC."

Prior works propose verification algorithms that are based on approximate reachability methods, but they often restrict the class of controllers and systems that can be handled or result in overly conservative analyses. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a popular formal verification tool for general nonlinear systems that can compute optimal reachable sets under worst-case system uncertainties; however, its application to perception-based systems is currently underexplored. In this work, we propose RoVer-CoRe, a framework for the Robust Verification of Controllers via HJ Reachability. To the best of our knowledge, RoVer-CoRe is the first HJ reachability-based framework for the verification of perception-based systems under perceptual uncertainty. Our key insight is to concatenate the system controller, observation function, and the state estimation modules to obtain an equivalent closed-loop system that is readily compatible with existing reachability frameworks. Within RoVer-CoRe, we propose novel methods for formal safety verification and robust controller design. We demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in case studies involving aircraft taxiing and NN-based rover navigation. Code is available at the link in the footnote."

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal data mining (STDM) has a wide range of applications in various complex physical systems (CPS), i.e., transportation, manufacturing, healthcare, etc. Among all the proposed methods, the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) has proved to be generalizable and extendable in different applications and has multiple variants achieving state-of-the-art performance in various STDM applications. However, ConvLSTM and its variants are computationally expensive, which makes them inapplicable in edge devices with limited computational resources. With the emerging need for edge computing in CPS, efficient AI is essential to reduce the computational cost while preserving the model performance. Common methods of efficient AI are developed to reduce redundancy in model capacity (i.e., model pruning, compression, etc.). However, spatiotemporal data mining naturally requires extensive model capacity, as the embedded dependencies in spatiotemporal data are complex and hard to capture, which limits the model redundancy. Instead, there is a fairly high level of data and feature redundancy that introduces an unnecessary computational burden, which has been largely overlooked in existing research. Therefore, we developed a novel framework SparseST, that pioneered in exploiting data sparsity to develop an efficient spatiotemporal model. In addition, we explore and approximate the Pareto front between model performance and computational efficiency by designing a multi-objective composite loss function, which provides a practical guide for practitioners to adjust the model according to computational resource constraints and the performance requirements of downstream tasks."

    "abstract": "On many learning platforms, the optimization criteria guiding model training reflect the priorities of the designer rather than those of the individuals they affect. Consequently, users may act strategically to obtain more favorable outcomes, effectively contesting the platform's predictions. While past work has studied strategic user behavior on learning platforms, the focus has largely been on strategic responses to a deployed model, without considering the behavior of other users. In contrast, look-ahead reasoning takes into account that user actions are coupled, and -- at scale -- impact future predictions. Within this framework, we first formalize level-$k$ thinking, a concept from behavioral economics, where users aim to outsmart their peers by looking one step ahead. We show that, while convergence to an equilibrium is accelerated, the equilibrium remains the same, providing no benefit of higher-level reasoning for individuals in the long run. Then, we focus on collective reasoning, where users take coordinated actions by optimizing through their joint impact on the model. By contrasting collective with selfish behavior, we characterize the benefits and limits of coordination; a new notion of alignment between the learner's and the users' utilities emerges as a key concept. We discuss connections to several related mathematical frameworks, including strategic classification, performative prediction, and algorithmic collective action."

In the formulation of Leiter & Hamdan (1973), the conditional mean of $X_2$ was specified as a function of $X_1$; Arnold & Manjunath (2021) subsequently augmented this specification by adding an intercept, yielding a linear conditional rate. A direct implication of this construction is that the bivariate pseudo-Poisson distribution can represent only positive correlation between the two variables. This study generalizes the conditional rate to accommodate negatively correlated datasets by introducing curvature. This augmentation provides the additional benefit of allowing the model to behave approximately linear when appropriate, while adequately handling the boundary case $(x_1,x_2)=(0,0)$. According to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the models proposed in this study outperform Arnold & Manjunath (2021)'s linear models."

    "abstract": "The (large-scale) structures we observe in the Universe are classical, but within the inflationary scenario they do originate from quantum fluctuations. This leads to the question: ''How did this quantum-to-classical transition occur?''. A potential explanation is quantum decoherence due to interactions between different fields present during inflation. The tensor modes (i.e. primordial gravitational waves) can interact with a scalar sector, causing their quantum decoherence to occur and inducing a change in the gravitational wave (GW) background. The power spectrum of these GWs can be constrained using the upper bounds found by Planck, BICEP/Keck Array, LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, and the Pulsar Timing Array detections. These impose constraints on the interaction between the fields. We find that the observational upper bounds mainly constrain scenarios with a strong interaction, especially if the interaction is also strongly time dependent. Furthermore, we find which observationally allowed scenarios have not completed decoherence by the end of inflation, thus possibly leaving quantum signatures in the GW background. Lastly, we show that, interestingly enough, there are decoherence scenarios corresponding to the signal observed by PTA experiments. This highlights the importance of the quantum decoherence effect on GWs."

Strong and weak lensing constraints on the density profiles of subhalos and their truncation radii offer key diagnostics for distinguishing between collisionless cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). Notably, in the strongly collisional SIDM regime, subhalo core collapse and enhanced mass loss from ram-pressure stripping predict steeper central density slopes and more compact truncation radii--features that are directly testable with current lensing data. We analyze subhalo truncation in eight lensing clusters (Abell 2218, 383, 963, 209, 2390, and MACS J0416.1, J1206.2, J1149.6) that span the redshift range <$z_\\text{spec}$>$ \\simeq 0.17$-$0.54$ with virial masses $M_{200} \\simeq0.41$-$2.2\\times 10^{15}$ M$_\\odot$ to constrain SIDM versus CDM. Our results indicate that the outer spatial extents of subhalos are statistically consistent with CDM, corroborated by redshift- and mass-matched analogs from the Illustris-TNG simulations. We conclude that the tidal radii of cluster galaxy subhalos serve as an important and complementary diagnostic of the nature of dark matter in these violent, dense environments."

A large variety of different such AT metrics have been proposed, and despite their wide-spread practical use, no systematic treatment of attack tree metrics so far is fully satisfactory. Existing approaches either fail to include important metrics, or they are too general to provide a useful systematic way for defining concrete AT metrics, giving only an abstract characterisation of their behaviour. We solve this problem by developing a compositional theory of ATs and their functorial semantics based on gs-monoidal categories. Viewing attack trees as string diagrams, we show that components of ATs form a channel category, a particular type of gs-monoidal category. AT metrics then correspond to functors of channel categories. This characterisation is both general enough to include all common AT metrics, and concrete enough to define AT metrics by their logical structure."

    "abstract": "The quadratic time and memory complexity of the attention mechanism in modern Transformer based video generators makes end-to-end training for ultra high resolution videos prohibitively expensive. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce a training-free approach that leverages video Diffusion Transformers pretrained at their native scale to synthesize higher resolution videos without any additional training or adaptation. At the core of our method lies an inward sliding window attention mechanism, which originates from a key observation: maintaining each query token's training scale receptive field is crucial for preserving visual fidelity and detail. However, naive local window attention, unfortunately, often leads to repetitive content and exhibits a lack of global coherence in the generated results. To overcome this challenge, we devise a dual-path pipeline that backs up window attention with a novel cross-attention override strategy, enabling the semantic content produced by local attention to be guided by another branch with a full receptive field and, therefore, ensuring holistic consistency. Furthermore, to improve efficiency, we incorporate a cross-attention caching strategy for this branch to avoid the frequent computation of full 3D attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method delivers ultra-high-resolution videos with fine-grained visual details and high efficiency in a training-free paradigm. Meanwhile, it achieves superior performance on VBench, even compared to training-based alternatives, with competitive or improved efficiency.

Our findings reveal that impactful early exposure triggers intrinsic motivations, while non-impactful exposure requires an extrinsic push (e.g., career/ personal goals, external validation). We identify curiosity and avoiding alternatives as a distinct educational drivers, and barriers to belonging as the only challenge persisting across education and career. Our findings show that career progression challenges (e.g., navigating the corporate world) constrain extrinsic fulfillment while technical training challenges, barriers to belonging and threats to motivation constrain intrinsic fulfillment. The theory shows how unmet motivations and recurring challenges influence persistence, career shifts, or departure from the field. Our results provide a grounded model for designing interventions that strengthen intrinsic fulfillment and reduce systemic barriers in SE education and practice."

We model the exoplanet populations around single stars, using planet occurrence rates and multiplicity depending on stellar mass, metallicity, and planet type, and assign them physical parameters such as mass and orbital period. Focussing first on the solar vicinity, we find mostly metallicity-driven differences in the distributions of non-hosting and planet-hosting single stars. In our simulated solar neighbourhood, 52.5% of all planets are Earth-like (23% of them located in the Habitable Zone), 44% are super-Earths/Neptunes, and 3.5% are giant planets. A comparison with the census of Kepler exoplanets and candidates shows that, when taking into account the most relevant selection effects, we obtain a similar distribution of exoplanets compared to the observed population. However, we also detect significant differences in the exoplanet and host star distributions (e.g. more planets around F-type and red-giant stars compared to observations) that we attribute mostly to a too strong recent star formation and a too large disc scale height in the simulation, as well as to some caveats in our exoplanet population synthesis that will be addressed in future work. Extending our analysis to other regions of the simulated MW and to other simulated galaxies, we find that the relative percentages of planet types remain largely consistent as long as the simulated galaxy matches the morphology and mass of the MW. We have created a fast and flexible framework to produce exoplanet populations based on MW-like simulations that can easily be adapted to produce predictions for the yields of future exoplanet detection missions.

    "abstract": "Today's most sensitive experiments for detecting CP-violating permanent electric dipole moments (EDM) rely on molecular spectroscopy. The high sensitivity arises from large internal electric fields that interact with the constituents of the molecule. For molecular ions it has long been assumed that experiments with static polarization from dc electric fields are infeasible, as the ion's charge would either shift it to a field free region or eject it from the trap. This constraint appears to make single ion quantum-logic clocks, among the most precise measurement devices available, incompatible with EDM measurements. Here, we demonstrate that, under typical trapping conditions, heavy molecular ions with small $Ω/Λ$-doubling can be polarized by a static electric field while remaining confined in the Paul trap. This effect arises from a cancellation between the electrostatic force and the trap's ponderomotive force, resulting in an equilibrium position where the ion experiences a dc electric field component. Dynamic decoupling allows to implement co-magnetometry schemes in a single molecule and provides long interrogation times. This will allow the operation of a quantum-logic molecular radio-frequency clock in static electric fields, providing sensitivity to EDMs. Working with only a few ions and non-destructive detection techniques opens the door to the use of highly sensitive, rare, and radioactive molecular species as well as quantum-enhanced metrology schemes to achieve unprecedented levels of accuracy and precision."

These problems are well known for slow convergence rates and non-standard limiting behavior, even under point identified parametric frameworks. In nonparametric settings, they may further suffer from failures of identification. To address these challenges, we introduce a strictly convex surrogate loss that point-identifies a representative nonparametric policy function. We then estimate this surrogate policy to conduct inference on both the optimal classification policy and the optimal policy value. This approach enables Gaussian inference, substantially simplifying empirical implementation relative to working directly with the original classification problem. In particular, we establish root-$n$ asymptotic normality for the optimal policy value and derive a Gaussian approximation for the optimal classification policy at the standard nonparametric rate. Extensive simulation studies corroborate the theoretical findings. We apply our method to the National JTPA Study to conduct inference on the optimal treatment assignment policy and its associated welfare."

At the next-order approximation, we have shown, by twenty English novels or writings (some are translated from another language to English), that quadratic functions in log-log scale fit the type-token data perfectly. Regression analyses of log(type)-log(token) data with both a linear and quadratic term consistently lead to a linear coefficient of slightly larger than 1, and a quadratic coefficient around -0.02. Using the ``random drawing colored ball from the bag with replacement\" model, we have shown that the curvature of the log-log scale is identical to a ``pseudo-variance\" which is negative. Although a pseudo-variance calculation may encounter numeric instability when the number of tokens is large, due to the large values of pseudo-weights, this formalism provides a rough estimation of the curvature when the number of tokens is small."

Furthermore, there is a growing need for tools to control ionization at the nanoscale. Here, we study HHG in silicon along a crystalline-to-amorphous (c-Si to a-Si) structural phase transition and observe a dramatic reshaping of the spectrum, with enhanced lower-order harmonic yield accompanied by quenching of the higher-order harmonics. Modelling the real-space quantum dynamics links our observations to a giant enhancement (>250 times) of tunnel ionization yield in the amorphous phase and a disorder-induced decoherence that damps the electron-hole polarization over approximately six lattice sites. HHG spectroscopy also reveals remnant order that was not apparent with conventional probes. Finally, we observe a rapid and targeted non-resonant laser annealing of amorphous silicon islands. Our results offer a unique insight into attosecond decoherence in strong-field phenomena, establish HHG spectroscopy as a probe of structural disorder, and pave the way for new opportunities in lightwave nanoelectronics."

The dependence of their masses as a function of isospin projection shows evidence for deviations from quadratic behavior indicating isospin violation beyond the expectation from two- body forces. The deviation is most pronounced for the 2+ states. Predictions from the Shell Model Embedded in the Continuum (SMEC) allow us to explain that this isospin violation is associated with a modification of the nuclear structure due to the open-quantum-system nature of the proton- rich members of the quintet. In particular, the 0+ and 2+ states in 16Ne and the 2+ state in 16F are threshold resonances located just above a proton-decay threshold where s-wave coupling to the continuum is expected. The measured deviations of these threshold states from the quadratic behavior of the remaining members of the multiplets makes it possible to obtain information on the magnitude and the energy dependence of the continuum-coupling energy correction. Continuum coupling is also indicated for the ground state of 8C, but this time through p-wave coupling."

Mapping protein features into hyperbolic space led to much higher accuracy than previous methods in predicting host-pathogen interactions. From tens of millions of possible protein pairs, our model identified thousands of high-confidence interactions, including many involving human G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). We validated dozens of these predicted complexes using AlphaFold 3 structural modeling, supporting the accuracy of our predictions.

    "abstract": "Transformer models are foundational to natural language processing (NLP) applications, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks introduced through poisoned data, which implant hidden behaviors during training. To strengthen the ability to prevent such compromises, recent research has focused on designing increasingly stealthy attacks to stress-test existing defenses, pairing backdoor behaviors with stylized artifact or token-level perturbation triggers. However, this trend diverts attention from the harder and more realistic case: making the model respond to semantic triggers such as specific names or entities, where a successful backdoor could manipulate outputs tied to real people or events in deployed systems. Motivated by this growing disconnect, we introduce SteganoBackdoor, bringing stealth techniques back into line with practical threat models. Leveraging innocuous properties from natural-language steganography, SteganoBackdoor applies a gradient-guided data optimization process to transform semantic trigger seeds into steganographic carriers that embed a high backdoor payload, remain fluent, and exhibit no representational resemblance to the trigger. Across diverse experimental settings, SteganoBackdoor achieves over 99% attack success at an order-of-magnitude lower data-poisoning rate than prior approaches while maintaining unparalleled evasion against a comprehensive suite of data-level defenses. By revealing this practical and covert attack, SteganoBackdoor highlights an urgent blind spot in current defenses and demands immediate attention to adversarial data defenses and real-world threat modeling."

Automatically learning these equations from experimental data is challenging when the data are noisy or limited, and existing approaches struggle, in particular, with the estimation of unobserved derivatives. Here, we introduce an integral Bayesian symbolic regression method that learns governing equations directly from raw time-series data, without requiring manual assumptions or error-prone derivative estimation. By sampling the space of symbolic differential equations and evaluating them via numerical integration, our method robustly identifies governing equations even from noisy or scarce data. We show that this approach accurately recovers ground-truth models in synthetic benchmarks, and that it makes quasi-optimal predictions of system dynamics for all noise regimes. Applying this method to bacterial growth experiments across multiple species and substrates, we discover novel growth equations that outperform classical models in accurately capturing all phases of microbial proliferation, including lag, exponential, and saturation. Unlike standard approaches, our method reveals subtle shifts in growth dynamics, such as double ramp-ups or non-canonical transitions, offering a deeper, data-driven understanding of microbial physiology."

    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive study of the axial-vector resonance $K_1(1270)$ within the unitarized chiral perturbation theory, focusing on its two-pole structure and manifestation in femtoscopic observables. By considering the dominant $ρK$ and $K^*π$ coupled channels, we reproduce the well-established double-pole structure and trace the chiral evolution of both poles as functions of the pion mass, using the vector-meson mass trajectories fitted to lattice-QCD data and experimental values. The lower pole, dominantly coupled to $K^*π$, evolves from an above-threshold resonance to a virtual or bound state with increasing pion mass. In comparison, the higher pole, dominantly coupled to $ρK$, moves downward in energy, reflecting the strengthening of the chiral attraction. The influence of the finite vector-meson widths is systematically examined, showing that their inclusion smooths the pole trajectories without altering their qualitative behavior. Furthermore, femtoscopic CFs are calculated for all relevant vector-pseudoscalar channels in both charged sectors. The results exhibit distinct resonance and bound-state features consistent with the two-pole dynamics. The weak impact of higher channels, such as $ω\\bar{K}$, $\\bar{K}^*η$, and $φ\\bar{K}$, confirms that the simplified two-channel treatment captures the essential dynamics of the $K_1(1270)$ resonance. This study demonstrates that combining chiral extrapolation and femtoscopic correlation analyses provides a powerful and complementary framework for connecting lattice-QCD calculations, chiral effective theory, and experimental measurements, offering new insights into the molecular nature and chiral origin of the $K_1(1270)$ resonance."

We introduce SciRAG, an open-source framework for scientific literature exploration that addresses these gaps through three key innovations: (1) adaptive retrieval that flexibly alternates between sequential and parallel evidence gathering; (2) citation-aware symbolic reasoning that leverages citation graphs to organize and filter supporting documents; and (3) outline-guided synthesis that plans, critiques, and refines answers to ensure coherence and transparent attribution. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks such as QASA and ScholarQA demonstrate that SciRAG outperforms prior systems in factual accuracy and synthesis quality, establishing a new foundation for reliable, large-scale scientific knowledge aggregation."

It is proved that, under certain assumptions on the penalization parameters, the limiting distribution of the estimator is given by the certain constrained estimator applied to the asymptotic distribution of the unrestricted estimator, and, consequently, the estimator preserves the rate of convergence of the underlying estimator. Next, without the fusion penalisation term, the limiting distribution of the estimator is given by the concatenation of the individual nearly-isotonic estimators applied to the specific sub-vectors of the asymptotic distribution of the unrestricted estimator. This behaviour is similar to the case of isotonic regression. The obtained results are also applied to the constrained estimation of a discrete distribution supported on a directed acyclic graph."

We employ a reweighting procedure that allows for the calculation of ensemble averages of observables during training for arbitrary values of the model parameters and on the fly. The method is general and can be applied to any set of static observables. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach by applying it to the generation of hybrid models for liquid water that reproduce accurately the experimental density maximum, the density isobar at 1 bar, and the radial distribution function in molecular dynamics simulations."

While existing works primarily focus on assessing how well LLMs adhere to user instructions, they often overlook scenarios where instructions contain conflicting constraints-a common occurrence in complex prompts. The behavior of LLMs under such conditions remains under-explored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ConInstruct, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' ability to detect and resolve conflicts within user instructions. Using this dataset, we evaluate LLMs' conflict detection performance and analyze their conflict resolution behavior. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) Most proprietary LLMs exhibit strong conflict detection capabilities, whereas among open-source models, only DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates similarly strong performance. DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.5-Sonnet achieve the highest average F1-scores at 91.5% and 87.3%, respectively, ranking first and second overall. (2) Despite their strong conflict detection abilities, LLMs rarely explicitly notify users about the conflicts or request clarification when faced with conflicting constraints. These results underscore a critical shortcoming in current LLMs and highlight an important area for future improvement when designing instruction-following LLMs."

These quantum algorithms, expressed as quantum circuits, need to be translated to a set of instructions from a defined quantum instruction-set architecture (ISA), which are executed by the control hardware. These translations can be done by a compiler, targeting different qubit technologies. Specifically for diamond NV centers, no compiler exists to perform this translation. Therefore, in this paper we present a compiler designed for quantum computers utilizing diamond NV center specific instructions, such as direct carbon control and partial swaps, to reduce execution times and gate count. Additionally, our compiler adds on top of general compilers by allowing classical instructions to perform state tomography and measurement-based operations. The output of the compiler is tested in a diamond NV center specific simulator. Comparing a general compiler output with the diamond NV center specific output of our compiler while applying decoherence and depolarization noise showed reduced noise effects due to diamond specific decomposition. The compiler was also tested to perform state tomography and measurement-based operations, which showed to be functional. Our results show that we have successfully created a compiler with integrated classical and quantum instructions support, which can improve circuit execution fidelity by utilizing diamond specific optimizations."

To address these challenges, we propose an edge-aware lightweight monocular SLAM system combining sparse keypoint-based pose estimation with dense edge reconstruction. Our method employs deep learning-based depth prediction and edge detection, followed by optimization to refine keypoints and edges for geometric consistency, without relying on global loop closure or heavy neural computations. We fuse inertial data with vision by using an extended Kalman filter to resolve scale ambiguity and improve accuracy. The system operates in real time on low-power platforms, as demonstrated on a DJI Tello drone with a monocular camera and inertial sensors. In addition, we demonstrate robust autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance in indoor corridors and on the TUM RGBD dataset. Our approach offers an effective, practical solution to real-time mapping and navigation in resource-constrained environments."

While the current methods demonstrate efficacy in small and controlled settings, they face challenges when applied to large-scale and diverse environments, marked by extended periods of exploration and suboptimal paths of discovery. In this paper, we propose MA-SLAM, a Map-Aware Active SLAM system based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), designed to address the challenge of efficient exploration in large-scale environments. In pursuit of this objective, we put forward a novel structured map representation. By discretizing the spatial data and integrating the boundary points and the historical trajectory, the structured map succinctly and effectively encapsulates the visited regions, thereby serving as input for the deep reinforcement learning based decision module. Instead of sequentially predicting the next action step within the decision module, we have implemented an advanced global planner to optimize the exploration path by leveraging long-range target points. We conducted experiments in three simulation environments and deployed in a real unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), the results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces both the duration and distance of exploration compared with state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Scaling up network depth is a fundamental pursuit in neural architecture design, as theory suggests that deeper models offer exponentially greater capability. Benefiting from the residual connections, modern neural networks can scale up to more than one hundred layers and enjoy wide success. However, as networks continue to deepen, current architectures often struggle to realize their theoretical capacity improvements, calling for more advanced designs to further unleash the potential of deeper networks. In this paper, we identify two key barriers that obstruct residual models from scaling deeper: shortcut degradation and limited width. Shortcut degradation hinders deep-layer learning, while the inherent depth-width trade-off imposes limited width. To mitigate these issues, we propose a generalized residual architecture dubbed Step by Step Network (StepsNet) to bridge the gap between theoretical potential and practical performance of deep models. Specifically, we separate features along the channel dimension and let the model learn progressively via stacking blocks with increasing width. The resulting method mitigates the two identified problems and serves as a versatile macro design applicable to various models. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms residual models across diverse tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and language modeling. These results position StepsNet as a superior generalization of the widely adopted residual architecture."

Most existing methods, whether using invasive sensors or computer vision, rely on two-stage pipelines, which result in high intrusiveness, intensive computation, and poor real-time performance on embedded edge devices. Inspired by YOLOv11-Pose, a lightweight single-stage network for sitting posture recognition on embedded edge devices termed LSP-YOLO was proposed. By integrating partial convolution(PConv) and Similarity-Aware Activation Module(SimAM), a lightweight module, Light-C3k2, was designed to reduce computational cost while maintaining feature extraction capability. In the recognition head, keypoints were directly mapped to posture classes through pointwise convolution, and intermediate supervision was employed to enable efficient fusion of pose estimation and classification. Furthermore, a dataset containing 5,000 images across six posture categories was constructed for model training and testing. The smallest trained model, LSP-YOLO-n, achieved 94.2% accuracy and 251 Fps on personal computer(PC) with a model size of only 1.9 MB. Meanwhile, real-time and high-accuracy inference under constrained computational resources was demonstrated on the SV830C + GC030A platform. The proposed approach is characterized by high efficiency, lightweight design and deployability, making it suitable for smart classrooms, rehabilitation, and human-computer interaction applications."

    "abstract": "As machine learning applications grow increasingly ubiquitous and complex, they face an increasing set of requirements beyond accuracy. The prevalent approach to handle this challenge is to aggregate a weighted combination of requirement violation penalties into the training objective. To be effective, this approach requires careful tuning of these hyperparameters (weights), involving trial-and-error and cross-validation, which becomes ineffective even for a moderate number of requirements. These issues are exacerbated when the requirements involve parities or equalities, as is the case in fairness and boundary value problems. An alternative technique uses constrained optimization to formulate these learning problems. Yet, existing approximation and generalization guarantees do not apply to problems involving equality constraints. In this work, we derive a generalization theory for equality-constrained statistical learning problems, showing that their solutions can be approximated using samples and rich parametrizations. Using these results, we propose a practical algorithm based on solving a sequence of unconstrained, empirical learning problems. We showcase its effectiveness and the new formulations enabled by equality constraints in fair learning, interpolating classifiers, and boundary value problems."

Motivated by results on the Exponential Decay of Sensitivities (EDS), which imply that, under certain conditions, the influence of modeling inaccuracies decreases exponentially along the prediction horizon, this paper proposes a multi-timescale MPC scheme for fast-sampled control. Tailored to systems with both fast and slow dynamics, the proposed approach improves computational efficiency by i) switching to a reduced model that captures only the slow, dominant dynamics and ii) exponentially increasing integration step sizes to progressively reduce model detail along the horizon. We evaluate the method on three practically motivated robotic control problems in simulation and observe speed-ups of up to an order of magnitude."

However, practical systems are often constrained by ultra-sparse-view sampling, which significantly degrades reconstruction quality. Traditional methods struggle under ultra-sparse-view settings, where interpolation becomes inaccurate and the resulting reconstructions are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, this study proposes Diffusion-Refined Neural Attenuation Fields (Diff-NAF), an iterative framework tailored for multi-source stationary CT under ultra-sparse-view conditions. Diff-NAF combines a Neural Attenuation Field representation with a dual-branch conditional diffusion model. The process begins by training an initial NAF using ultra-sparse-view projections. New projections are then generated through an Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis strategy that exploits inter view priors, and are subsequently refined by a Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module. The refined projections are incorporated as pseudo-labels into the training set for the next iteration. Through iterative refinement, Diff-NAF progressively enhances projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity under ultra-sparse-view conditions, ultimately yielding high-quality CT reconstructions. Experimental results on multiple simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data demonstrate that Diff-NAF achieves the best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions."

The hardware design can be flexibly configured to facilitate parallel execution of instructions that have identical parameters. Furthermore, the compiler uses the underlying hardware constraints to intelligently reorder and decompose instructions to avoid dependencies. The compiler, hardware, and their combination are evaluated using a runtime calculator and a benchmark quantum algorithm set. The results demonstrate a significant speedup, achieving a maximum average speedup of 16.5x and a maximum single-benchmark speedup of 56.2x relative to a baseline, serial execution model. Furthermore, we show a speedup can be obtained across all benchmarks using any of the proposed hardware schemes, although the degree of speedup is largely dependent on the type of quantum algorithm. Taken together, the results of this paper represent a significant step towards realizing high-performance quantum computing systems."

The Nernst and Hall effects of the series were systematically analyzed, complemented with resistivity, magnetic, electron microscopy and Mössbauer experiments, and DFT calculations including elastic properties. The Fe$_4$N phase crystallizes in the cubic symmetry with Pm3m space group, whereas a small tetragonal distortion is realized in for x>0.35. From the comparison of the experimental isomer shift with DFT calculations, we conclude that Ge occupies the 4b site in the tetragonal I4/mcm tructure. Ferromagnetic T$_C$ decreases rapidly from 750 K for x=0 to 100 K for x=1. The tetragonal samples with x=0.8 and 1 display two-component behavior in the Hall and Nernst effects hysteresis loops, which can be analyzed as a sum of positive and negative loops with different saturation fields. This unusual behavior is a product of a combination of several factors. (1) Co-existence of two different crystallographic orientations in the tetragonal thin film, namely with the majority of c-axis and minority of a-axis normal to the film surface. (2) Opposite sign of the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects for the direction of magnetization along the a and c-axis revealed by DFT calculation. (3) The magnetocrystalline anisotropy characterized by an easy ab-plane, which is responsible for the different saturation fields for a and c-axis. The maximum ANE was determined to be 0.9 $μ$V/K for x=0 at room temperature, and -0.85 $μ$V/K for x=1 at T=50 K.

    "abstract": "Covariate adjustment can enhance precision and power in clinical trials, yet its application to the win odds remains unclear. The win odds is an extension of the win ratio that includes ties. In their original form, both methods rely on comparing each individual from the treatment group to each individual from the control group in pairwise manner, and count the number of wins, losses, and ties from these pairwise comparisons. A priori, it is not clear how covariate adjustment can be implemented for the win odds. To address this, we establish a connection between the win odds and the marginal probabilistic index, a measure for which covariate adjustment theory is well-developed. Using this connection, we show how covariate adjustment for the win odds is possible, leading to potentially more precise estimators and larger power as compared to the unadjusted win odds. We present the underlying theory for covariate adjustment for the win odds in an accessible way and apply the method on synthetic data based on the CANTOS trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01327846) characteristics and on simulated data to study the operating characteristics of the method. We observe that there is indeed a potential gain in power when the win odds are adjusted for baseline covariates if the baseline covariates are prognostic for the outcome. This comes at the cost of a slight inflation of the type I error rate for small sample sizes."

We provide a precise form for the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic derivatives of the isomonodromic deformation of a Higgs bundle. Subsequently, we extend the classical non-abelian Kodaira-Spencer map using the anti-holomorphic derivative. Additionally, we prove that if the isomonodromic deformation of a graded Higgs bundle is not holomorphic, then the isomonodromically deformed Higgs field is non-nilpotent."

    "abstract": "The development of nanophotonics is hindered by a fundamental trade-off between a material's refractive index (n) and its electronic bandgap (Eg), which severely restricts the choice of materials for short-wavelength applications. This challenge is particularly acute in the visible and ultraviolet (UV) spectra, where high-performance devices require materials that are simultaneously highly refractive and transparent. Here, we report on the van der Waals (vdW) crystal cadmium phosphorus trisulfide (CdPS3) as a solution to this long-standing problem. Through comprehensive optical and structural characterization, we show that CdPS3 possesses an anomalously high in-plane refractive index across the visible spectrum approaching 3 in the near-UV, combined with a wide indirect bandgap. This combination of properties, which circumvents the empirical Moss's law, is validated by first-principles calculations and direct near-field imaging of highly confined waveguide modes. These findings establish CdPS3 as a leading material for UV-visible photonics, opening a new pathway for the development of high-density integrated circuits and metasurfaces."

Within this domain, short-term prediction of rapid behavioral changes in complex maritime environments has established multimodal trajectory prediction (MTP) as a promising research area. However, existing vessel MTP methods suffer from limited scenario applicability and insufficient explainability. To address these challenges, we propose a unified MTP framework incorporating explainable navigation intentions, which we classify into sustained and transient categories. Our method constructs sustained intention trees from historical trajectories and models dynamic transient intentions using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), while using a non-local attention mechanism to maintain global scenario consistency. Experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) datasets demonstrates our method's broad applicability across diverse scenarios, achieving significant improvements in both ADE and FDE. Furthermore, our method improves explainability by explicitly revealing the navigational intentions underlying each predicted trajectory."

To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{ManipBench}, a large-scale benchmark for image manipulation detection and localization focusing on AI-edited images. ManipBench contains over 450K manipulated images produced by 25 state-of-the-art image editing models across 12 manipulation categories, among which 100K images are further annotated with bounding boxes, judgment cues, and textual explanations to support interpretable detection. Building upon ManipBench, we propose \\textbf{ManipShield}, an all-in-one model based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that leverages contrastive LoRA fine-tuning and task-specific decoders to achieve unified image manipulation detection, localization, and explanation. Extensive experiments on ManipBench and several public datasets demonstrate that ManipShield achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generality to unseen manipulation models.

    "abstract": "Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) converts audio recordings into symbolic musical representations. Training deep neural networks (DNNs) for AMT typically requires strongly aligned training pairs with precise frame-level annotations. Since creating such datasets is costly and impractical for many musical contexts, weakly aligned approaches using segment-level annotations have gained traction. However, existing methods often rely on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) or soft alignment loss functions, both of which still require local semantic correspondences, making them error-prone and computationally expensive. In this article, we introduce CountEM, a novel AMT framework that eliminates the need for explicit local alignment by leveraging note event histograms as supervision, enabling lighter computations and greater flexibility. Using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach, CountEM iteratively refines predictions based solely on note occurrence counts, significantly reducing annotation efforts while maintaining high transcription accuracy. Experiments on piano, guitar, and multi-instrument datasets demonstrate that CountEM matches or surpasses existing weakly supervised methods, improving AMT's robustness, scalability, and efficiency.

Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models. Our framework not only improves forecasting accuracy but also offers practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions."

We investigate the inner, sub-arcsecond active region of R Aqr during this recent periastron passage, with the goal of gaining insight into the jet-launching mechanisms at work in this system. We analyse Ha speckle interferometric images obtained one month apart using Fourier techniques. These are complemented by high-resolution optical spectra in the same emission line. Our speckle imaging reveals a newborn two-sided jet orientated in the north-south direction. Its proper motion, 66 +- 19 mas per year, confirms that it was launched around 2020 Jan 7, at the onset of the periastron passage. Further analysis of the elongated central structure reveals a knot in the southern counterpart of the jet, moving away from the binary with a 27 +- 17 mas per year at a position angle of 187 degrees, and an ejection time around 2019 Oct 28. This interpretation is further supported by our high-resolution spectroscopic data. In addition, we update the expansion parallax distance of R Aqr to 260 pc."

Arabic has a complicated morphological and syntactic structure, posing a greater challenge than other languages. Even though modern neural models have improved greatly in recent years, the majority of previous attempts used individual models without taking into account the potential benefits of combining different systems. In this paper, we present one of the first multi-system approaches for correcting grammatical errors in Arabic, the Arab Enhanced Edit Selection System Complication (ArbESC+). Several models are used to collect correction proposals, which are represented as numerical features in the framework. A classifier determines and implements the appropriate corrections based on these features. In order to improve output quality, the framework uses support techniques to filter overlapping corrections and estimate decision reliability. A combination of AraT5, ByT5, mT5, AraBART, AraBART+Morph+GEC, and Text editing systems gave better results than a single model alone, with F0.5 at 82.63% on QALB-14 test data, 84.64% on QALB-15 L1 data, and 65.55% on QALB-15 L2 data. As one of the most significant contributions of this work, it's the first Arab attempt to integrate linguistic error correction. Improving existing models provides a practical step towards developing advanced tools that will benefit users and researchers of Arabic text processing."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enhanced text-based recommendation by enriching traditional ID-based methods with semantic generalization capabilities. Text-based methods typically encode item textual information via prompt design and generate discrete semantic IDs through item tokenization. However, in domain-specific tasks such as local-life services, simply injecting location information into prompts fails to capture fine-grained spatial characteristics and real-world distance awareness among items. To address this, we propose LGSID, an LLM-Aligned Geographic Item Tokenization Framework for Local-life Recommendation. This framework consists of two key components: (1) RL-based Geographic LLM Alignment, and (2) Hierarchical Geographic Item Tokenization. In the RL-based alignment module, we initially train a list-wise reward model to capture real-world spatial relationships among items. We then introduce a novel G-DPO algorithm that uses pre-trained reward model to inject generalized spatial knowledge and collaborative signals into LLMs while preserving their semantic understanding. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical geographic item tokenization strategy, where primary tokens are derived from discrete spatial and content attributes, and residual tokens are refined using the aligned LLM's geographic representation vectors. Extensive experiments on real-world Kuaishou industry datasets show that LGSID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art discriminative and generative recommendation models. Ablation studies, visualizations, and case studies further validate its effectiveness."

    "abstract": "Video inverse problems are fundamental to streaming, telepresence, and AR/VR, where high perceptual quality must coexist with tight latency constraints. Diffusion-based priors currently deliver state-of-the-art reconstructions, but existing approaches either adapt image diffusion models with ad hoc temporal regularizers - leading to temporal artifacts - or rely on native video diffusion models whose iterative posterior sampling is far too slow for real-time use. We introduce InstantViR, an amortized inference framework for ultra-fast video reconstruction powered by a pre-trained video diffusion prior. We distill a powerful bidirectional video diffusion model (teacher) into a causal autoregressive student that maps a degraded video directly to its restored version in a single forward pass, inheriting the teacher's strong temporal modeling while completely removing iterative test-time optimization. The distillation is prior-driven: it only requires the teacher diffusion model and known degradation operators, and does not rely on externally paired clean/noisy video data. To further boost throughput, we replace the video-diffusion backbone VAE with a high-efficiency LeanVAE via an innovative teacher-space regularized distillation scheme, enabling low-latency latent-space processing. Across streaming random inpainting, Gaussian deblurring and super-resolution, InstantViR matches or surpasses the reconstruction quality of diffusion-based baselines while running at over 35 FPS on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving up to 100 times speedups over iterative video diffusion solvers. These results show that diffusion-based video reconstruction is compatible with real-time, interactive, editable, streaming scenarios, turning high-quality video restoration into a practical component of modern vision systems."

However, some existing vessel Re-ID methods are directly adapted from pedestrian-focused algorithms, making them ill-suited for mitigating the unique problems present in vessel images, particularly the greater intra-identity variations and more severe missing of local parts, which lead to the emergence of outlier samples within the same identity. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Correlation-aware Transformer Network (MCFormer), which explicitly models multi-scale correlations across the entire input set to suppress the adverse effects of outlier samples with intra-identity variations or local missing, incorporating two novel modules, the Global Correlation Module (GCM), and the Local Correlation Module (LCM). Specifically, GCM constructs a global similarity affinity matrix across all input images to model global correlations through feature aggregation based on inter-image consistency, rather than solely learning features from individual images as in most existing approaches. Simultaneously, LCM mines and aligns local features of positive samples with contextual similarity to extract local correlations by maintaining a dynamic memory bank, effectively compensating for missing or occluded regions in individual images. To further enhance feature robustness, MCFormer integrates global and local features that have been respectively correlated across multiple scales, effectively capturing latent relationships among image features. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that MCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance."

Minimally invasive repairs involving branch vessels necessitate detailed 3D anatomical analysis. Existing methods often overlook hierarchical anatomical relationships while struggling with severe class imbalance inherent in vascular structures. We address these challenges with a curriculum learning strategy that leverages a novel fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning. Inspired by human cognition, our approach progressively learns anatomical constraints by decomposing complex structures from simple to complex components. The curriculum learning framework naturally addresses class imbalance by first establishing robust feature representations for dominant classes before tackling rare but anatomically critical structures, significantly accelerating model convergence in multi-class scenarios. Our two-stage inference strategy achieves up to fivefold acceleration, enhancing clinical practicality. On the validation set at epoch 50, our hierarchical semantic loss improves the Dice score of nnU-Net ResEnc M by 11.65%. The proposed model demonstrates a 5.6% higher Dice score than baselines on the test set. Experimental results show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making the framework suitable for real-time clinical applications.

This dataset contains over 100 hours of naturalistic data from multiple production autonomous-driving vehicle models in the market. We segment the original data into 32,727 key frames, each consisting of four synchronized camera images and high-precision GNSS/IMU data (0.8 cm localization accuracy). For each key frame, 20 Hz vehicle trajectories spanning the past 6 s and future 5 s are provided, along with detailed 2D annotations of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and traffic signs.

To evaluate the safety of AVs, we employ an end-to-end motion planning model that predicts vehicle trajectories with an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 1.4 m on autonomous-driving frames.

The prevailing works address these degradations in isolation, developing highly specialized, specialist models that lack scalability and fail to exploit the shared underlying essences of these restoration problems. While specialist models are limited, recent large-scale pretrained generalist models offer powerful, text-driven image editing capabilities. while recent general-purpose systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Flux Kontext, Nano Banana) require detailed prompts and often fail to achieve robust removal on these fine-grained tasks or preserve identity of the scene. Leveraging the common essence of soft effects, i.e., semi-transparent occlusions, we introduce a foundational versatile model UniSER, capable of addressing diverse degradations caused by soft effects within a single framework. Our methodology centers on curating a massive 3.8M-pair dataset to ensure robustness and generalization, which includes novel, physically-plausible data to fill critical gaps in public benchmarks, and a tailored training pipeline that fine-tunes a Diffusion Transformer to learn robust restoration priors from this diverse data, integrating fine-grained mask and strength controls.

A 2.2 MWh, 1.1 MW Tesla battery, emulating operations at the University of Queensland's St. Lucia campus, is used as a test system. Traditionally, Model Predictive Control (MPC) frameworks rely on deterministic spot price forecasts from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to optimize battery scheduling. However, these forecasts lack uncertainty awareness, making arbitrage strategies vulnerable to extreme price volatility. To address this, we propose simple heuristic uncertainty discounting methods, which require no access to the predictive model's architecture or inputs. By integrating these strategies into existing MPC frameworks, we demonstrate a more than 20% improvement in economic returns under identical operational constraints. This approach enhances decision-making in energy arbitrage while remaining practical, scalable, and independent of specific forecasting models"

    "abstract": "Video Moment Retrieval is a task in video understanding that aims to localize a specific temporal segment in an untrimmed video based on a natural language query. Despite recent progress in moment retrieval from videos using both traditional techniques and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), most existing methods still rely on coarse temporal understanding and a single visual modality, limiting performance on complex videos. To address this, we introduce \\textit{S}hot-aware \\textit{M}ultimodal \\textit{A}udio-enhanced \\textit{R}etrieval of \\textit{T}emporal \\textit{S}egments (SMART), an MLLM-based framework that integrates audio cues and leverages shot-level temporal structure. SMART enriches multimodal representations by combining audio and visual features while applying \\textbf{Shot-aware Token Compression}, which selectively retains high-information tokens within each shot to reduce redundancy and preserve fine-grained temporal details. We also refine prompt design to better utilize audio-visual cues. Evaluations on Charades-STA and QVHighlights show that SMART achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including a 1.61\\% increase in R1@0.5 and 2.59\\% gain in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA."

    "abstract": "Fine-grained identification of IDS-flagged suspicious traffic is crucial in cybersecurity. In practice, cyber threats evolve continuously, making the discovery of novel malicious traffic a critical necessity as well as the identification of known classes. Recent studies have advanced this goal with deep models, but they often rely on task-specific architectures that limit transferability and require per-dataset tuning. In this paper we introduce MalRAG, the first LLM driven retrieval-augmented framework for open-set malicious traffic identification. MalRAG freezes the LLM and operates via comprehensive traffic knowledge construction, adaptive retrieval, and prompt engineering. Concretely, we construct a multi-view traffic database by mining prior malicious traffic from content, structural, and temporal perspectives. Furthermore, we introduce a Coverage-Enhanced Retrieval Algorithm that queries across these views to assemble the most probable candidates, thereby improving the inclusion of correct evidence. We then employ Traffic-Aware Adaptive Pruning to select a variable subset of these candidates based on traffic-aware similarity scores, suppressing incorrect matches and yielding reliable retrieved evidence. Moreover, we develop a suite of guidance prompts where task instruction, evidence referencing, and decision guidance are integrated with the retrieved evidence to improve LLM performance. Across diverse real-world datasets and settings, MalRAG delivers state-of-the-art results in both fine-grained identification of known classes and novel malicious traffic discovery. Ablation and deep-dive analyses further show that MalRAG effective leverages LLM capabilities yet achieves open-set malicious traffic identification without relying on a specific LLM."

We present FailSafe, a fault-tolerant TP serving system that sustains high performance under irregular GPU availability. FailSafe introduces three techniques to balance computation and memory across GPUs: (1) Cyclic KVCache Placement for uniform memory utilization, (2) Hybrid Attention combining tensor- and data-parallel attention to eliminate stragglers, and (3) Fine-Grained Load-Aware Routing to dynamically balance requests. It further employs proactive KVCache backup and on-demand weight recovery to avoid expensive recomputation and redundant data transfers. We implement these techniques in a lightweight serving engine compatible with existing LLM infrastructures. Evaluated on an 8xH100 DGX system with real-world fault traces and representative workloads, FailSafe achieves up to 2x higher throughput and two orders of magnitude lower recovery latency compared to standard fault handling approaches. Even with up to three GPU failures, FailSafe sustains high throughput and balanced utilization, demonstrating robust and efficient LLM serving under dynamic and unreliable hardware conditions."

It is crucial for downstream tasks like bias mitigation, preventing malicious adaptation, attribute disentanglement, and generalizable fine-tuning of diffusion policy. We propose Coffee that allows using language to specify undesired concepts to regularize the adaptation process. The crux of our method lies in keeping the embeddings of the user prompt from aligning with undesired concepts. Crucially, Coffee requires no additional training and enables flexible modification of undesired concepts by modifying textual descriptions. We evaluate Coffee by fine-tuning on images associated with user prompts paired with undesired concepts. Experimental results demonstrate that Coffee can prevent text-to-image models from learning specified undesired concepts during fine-tuning and outperforms existing methods.

Thousands of rare and zero-shot ICD codes are severely underrepresented in datasets like MIMIC-III, leading to low macro-F1 scores. In this work, we propose a data-centric framework that generates high-quality synthetic discharge summaries to mitigate this imbalance. Our method constructs realistic multi-label code sets anchored on rare codes by leveraging real-world co-occurrence patterns, ICD descriptions, synonyms, taxonomy, and similar clinical notes. Using these structured prompts, we generate 90,000 synthetic notes covering 7,902 ICD codes, significantly expanding the training distribution. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art transformer-based models, PLM-ICD and GKI-ICD, on both the original and extended datasets. Experiments show that our approach modestly improves macro-F1 while maintaining strong micro-F1, outperforming prior SOTA. While the gain may seem marginal relative to the computational cost, our results demonstrate that carefully crafted synthetic data can enhance equity in long-tail ICD code prediction."

However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout. Our work fully leverages the automatic collaboration capabilities of large-model-driven multi-agent systems. Experimental results on the RICO dataset show that our APD-agents achieve state-of-the-art performance."

Small telescopes offer several advantages: they are cost-effective, occupy less space, and are simpler to set up than larger instruments. This makes them particularly suitable for amateur astronomers and educational institutions with limited resources. Moreover, small telescopes can effectively observe bright celestial objects, enabling valuable contributions to astronomical projects. Based on the Sol'EX design, SPECTRUMMATE was constructed using optical components available at the Space and Applications Laboratory (SpaceLAB), University of Science and Technology of Hanoi, Vietnam. The instrument is designed to meet the specific needs of astronomers who require detailed analysis within the visible spectrum (SPECTRUMMATE can capture a waveband of 368 angstrom/image, spectral coverage from 4000 to 6600 angstrom, and resolving power R = 2546 at 5500 angstrom). To achieve optimal performance, the design process involved selecting and configuring optical elements, including a collimator, diffraction grating, and objective lens. Experimental setups were tested to minimize spectral dispersion while ensuring the system's compactness and ease of alignment. Spectra obtained by SPECTRUMMATE demonstrated efficient spectral calibration and the capability to capture high-resolution spectra of bright light sources, such as the Sun, making it a valuable tool for specialised spectroscopic observations. The modular design of SPECTRUMMATE also allows users to change its components easily to achieve the desired spectral range and resolution."

We formulate the background evolution of the dark sector as an autonomous dynamical system, defining interaction terms $Q_1=α\\,\\dot{f}$ and $Q_2=-\\dot{f}\\,(1+α)$, with $α$ a constant parameter and $f$ a time-dependent function. Three interaction cases are studied: $f \\propto ρ_m$, $f \\propto ρ_{de}$, and $f \\propto ρ_m + ρ_{de}$, assuming a constant dark-energy equation of state $w_{de}$. For each scenario, we derive the closed dynamical system in terms of the density parameters $(Ω_{de}, Ω_m)$, identify its fixed points, and analyze their stability across the parameter space. In this context, the phase-space exhibits a standard cosmological dynamics: an unstable radiation point, a transient matter saddle, and a stable late-time attractor with accelerated expansion. In addition, we utilize a joint likelihood analysis with Cosmic Chronometers, PantheonPlus, and DESI data to obtain marginalized parameter estimates at the $68\\%$ and $95\\%$ confidence levels, constraining the parameter space in each interaction model."

    "abstract": "Run-time integrity enforcement in real-time systems presents a fundamental conflict with availability. Existing approaches in real- time systems primarily focus on minimizing the execution-time overhead of monitoring. After a violation is detected, prior works face a trade-off: (1) prioritize availability and allow a compromised system to continue to ensure applications meet their deadlines, or (2) prioritize security by generating a fault to abort all execution. In this work, we propose PAIR, an approach that offers a middle ground between the stark extremes of this trade-off. PAIR monitors real-time tasks for run-time integrity violations and maintains an Availability Region (AR) of all tasks that are safe to continue. When a task causes a violation, PAIR triggers a non-maskable interrupt to kill the task and continue executing a non-violating task within AR. Thus, PAIR ensures only violating tasks are prevented from execution, while granting availability to remaining tasks. With its hardware approach, PAIR does not cause any run-time overhead to the executing tasks, integrates with real-time operating systems (RTOSs), and is affordable to low-end microcontroller units (MCUs) by incurring +2.3% overhead in memory and hardware usage."

    "abstract": "The present study systematically investigates the modulation mechanism of post-selected weak measurement (WM) on the non-classical properties of entangled coherent states (ECSs). The primary goal is achieving controllable enhancement of quantum resources such as entanglement and squeezing, while minimising disturbance to the quantum state. We theoretically analyze the post-selected weak measurement process, and its effectiveness in amplifying the non-classical features of ECSs. The von Neumann measurement model is employed to analytically describe the weak-value amplification of the pointer state. It is demonstrated that a significant enhancement of squeezing can be achieved by tuning the measurement coupling strength. The joint Wigner function analysis in phase space further reveals that, as the coupling strength increases, the coherent structure of the state evolves from symmetric double peaks to multi-branch quantum interference fringes. The entanglement, quantified by the Hillery-Zubairy criterion, exhibits a pronounced increase with stronger coupling, while the quantum Fisher information indicates a systematic improvement in phase estimation precision. The results obtained establish a tunable weak measurement framework for precise manipulation of continuous-variable entangled states. This provides a feasible theoretical pathway for enhancing quantum metrology and measurement-based state engineering."

To accelerate their convergence, we adapt the proximal bundle surrogate framework that can incorporate a list of more accurate surrogate functions, to both the primal and the dual updates of DA and MM, leading to a family of novel primal-dual bundle methods. Our methods generalize the primal-dual gradient method, DA, the linearized MM, and MM. Under standard assumptions that allow for a broad range of surrogate functions, we prove theoretical convergence guarantees for the proposed methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods converge not only faster, but also significantly more robust with respect to the parameters compared to the primal-dual gradient method, DA, the linearized MM, and MM."

    "abstract": "The Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) model, also known as the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, is arguably the most universal model in classical and quantum physics, describing spectrally narrow or long-wavelength distributions of interacting waves or particles. Modern applications -- from oceanic and atmospheric flows to photonics and cold atoms -- predominantly involve states that are far from equilibrium, culminating in the regime of fully developed turbulence. To date, a consistent theoretical description of such states has only existed for weakly interacting quasiparticles. Here we present a theory of strong turbulence in the two-dimensional $N$-component Gross-Pitaevskii model for both repulsive and attractive interactions, corresponding to the defocusing and focusing cases, respectively. In the focusing case, we show that attraction is enhanced by multi-wave effects, leading to a critical-balance state independent of the pumping level. In the defocusing case, repulsion is suppressed by collective effects, giving rise to another type of universality in strong turbulence -- independence from the bare coupling constant. The theory is confirmed by analytical results in the many-component limit and by direct numerical simulations of the single-component GP model."

    "abstract": "The collective frequency that emerges from synchronized neuronal populations--the network resonance--shows a systematic relationship with brain size: whole-brain's large networks oscillate slowly, whereas finer parcellations of fixed volume exhibit faster rhythms. This resonance-size scaling has been reported in delayed neural mass models and human neuroimaging, yet the physical mechanism remained unresolved. Here we show that size-dependent resonance follows directly from propagation delays in delay-coupled phase oscillators. Starting from a Kuramoto model with heterogeneous delays, we linearize around the near-synchronous solution and obtain a closed-form approximation linking the resonance $Ω$ to the mean delay and the effective coupling field. The analysis predicts a generic scaling law: $Ω\\approx (\\sum_j c_{ij} τ)^{-1}$, so resonance is delay-limited and therefore depends systematically on geometric size or parcellation density. We evaluate four growth scenarios--expanding geometry, fixed-volume parcellation, constant geometry, and an unphysical reference case--and show that only geometry-consistent scaling satisfies the analytical prediction. Numerical simulations with heterogeneous delays validate the law and quantify its error as a function of delay dispersion. These results identify a minimal physical mechanism for size-dependent cortical resonance and provide an analytical framework that unifies numeric simulation outputs."

The key challenges of the task lie in two aspects: (1) faithfully preserving the garment details, and (2) gaining fine-grained controllability over the model's appearance. Existing methods typically require performing garment deformation in the generation process, which often leads to garment texture distortions. Also, they fail to control the fine-grained attributes of the generated models, due to the lack of specifically designed mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose FashionMAC, a novel diffusion-based deformation-free framework that achieves high-quality and controllable fashion showcase image generation. The core idea of our framework is to eliminate the need for performing garment deformation and directly outpaint the garment segmented from a dressed person, which enables faithful preservation of the intricate garment details. Moreover, we propose a novel region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism along with a chained mask injection strategy to achieve fine-grained appearance controllability over the synthesized human models. Specifically, RADA adaptively predicts the generated regions for each fine-grained text attribute and enforces the text attribute to focus on the predicted regions by a chained mask injection strategy, significantly enhancing the visual fidelity and the controllability. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our framework compared to existing state-of-the-art methods."

While NRSS is typically restricted to materials with particular symmetry constraints, here we demonstrate, using density functional theory (DFT) and tight-binding transport calculations, that twin boundaries can induce NRSS in magnetic systems where it is otherwise forbidden. We focus on two representative material systems: the tetragonal perovskite oxide BiCoO$_3$ with $90^{\\circ}$ ferroelastic domain walls, and the rhombohedral layered delafossite-type oxide CoO$_2$, supporting $71^{\\circ}$, $109^{\\circ}$, and $135^{\\circ}$ twin boundaries. Our results reveal that, if these boundaries coexist with ferromagnetic domain walls, they consistently produce NRSS similar to that of d-wave altermagnets, with nodal surfaces dictated by the underlying symmetry of the supercell containing the twin boundary. Tight-binding models further elucidate how the NRSS and derived transport properties scale with domain size and density. Our results put forward twin boundary engineering as a versatile route to realize and control spin splitting in a broader class of materials."

Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable. This strongly indicates the possibility of synthetic data in developing high-performance AI models for severe and critical medical situations."

    "abstract": "Multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) super-resolution intends to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) scans by leveraging structural information present in HR reference images acquired with different contrasts. This technique enhances anatomical detail and soft tissue differentiation, which is vital for early diagnosis and clinical decision-making. However, inherent contrasts disparities between modalities pose fundamental challenges in effectively utilizing reference image textures to guide target image reconstruction, often resulting in suboptimal feature integration. To address this issue, we propose a dual-prompt expert network based on a convolutional dictionary feature decoupling (CD-DPE) strategy for multi-contrast MRI super-resolution. Specifically, we introduce an iterative convolutional dictionary feature decoupling module (CD-FDM) to separate features into cross-contrast and intra-contrast components, thereby reducing redundancy and interference. To fully integrate these features, a novel dual-prompt feature fusion expert module (DP-FFEM) is proposed. This module uses a frequency prompt to guide the selection of relevant reference features for incorporation into the target image, while an adaptive routing prompt determines the optimal method for fusing reference and target features to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on public multi-contrast MRI datasets demonstrate that CD-DPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing fine details. Additionally, experiments on unseen datasets demonstrated that CD-DPE exhibits strong generalization capabilities."

While decoherence is detrimental to this conditional entanglement, successive photon detections act as a purification process and restores the spin squeezing.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks achieve outstanding performance in visual recognition tasks, yet their large number of parameters makes them less practical for real-world applications. Recently, one-shot pruning has emerged as an effective strategy for reducing model size without additional training. However, models trained with standard objective functions often suffer a significant drop in accuracy after aggressive pruning. Some existing pruning-robust optimizers, such as SAM, and CrAM, mitigate this accuracy drop by guiding the model toward flatter regions of the parameter space, but they inevitably incur non-negligible additional computations. We propose a Variance Amplifying Regularizer (VAR) that deliberately increases the variance of model parameters during training. Our study reveals an intriguing finding that parameters with higher variance exhibit greater pruning robustness. VAR exploits this property by promoting such variance in the weight distribution, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of pruning. We further provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, supported by extensive empirical results demonstrating the superior pruning robustness of VAR."

    "abstract": "We investigate channel-confined, nematic liquid crystals using the Beris-Edwards model of nematohydrodynamics. Using strong homeotropic anchoring at the walls, we find multistability i.e. multiple coexisting states where the uniform nematic state coexists with states having spatially varying scalar nematic order and director fields. When a pressure gradient is applied, flows develop, and the inherent multistability of the system organizes a variety of complex dynamics. For low pressure gradients, steady flows are established, and the director fields that emerge from the multistable states at equilibrium correspond to Bowser and Dowser configurations similar to those reported in experiments. An increasing pressure-gradient destabilizes steady Bowser and Dowser flow states sequentially, leading to unsteady periodic and chaotic regimes featuring cyclical topological transitions, pulsating flows, advecting defects and spatiotemporal chaos. These findings demonstrate that modest variations in the scalar nematic order, as captured by the Beris-Edwards model, can qualitatively modify equilibrium structures and give rise to complex nonequilibrium behaviour in confined nematics-contrasting with the Ericksen-Leslie model, which assumes a constant scalar order parameter. Our key model predictions - multistability, periodically oscillating states and advecting defect-mediated turbulence can be experimentally investigated in pressure-driven channel flows of nematic fluids."

Thereby the result improves upon the perturbative derivation in [HS23] in the case of a monokinetic limit density."

They are compressible and have a parallel component of displacement. They do not propagate parallel vorticity and are driven by pressure and magnetic tension. In non-uniform plasmas the situation can be very different. The clear division between Alfvén waves and magneto-sonic waves is no longer present. In a given part of the equilibrium an MHD wave can strongly resemble a magneto-sonic wave with little or no resemblance to Alfvén waves; while in another part of the equilibrium the MHD wave is practically an Alfvén wave, which has the amazing property of being accompanied by variations in pressure."

Using optically detected microwave spectroscopy in an atomic beam, we determine the approximately 1.12 cm$^{-1}$ doublet spacing for the five stable bosonic isotopes of Dy with kHz-level accuracy. From the shift of the microwave transition frequency in low electric fields (below 150 V/cm) and from optical spectra in high electric fields (up to 150 kV/cm), a reduced transition dipole moment of 7.65 $\\pm$ 0.05 Debye between the doublet states is extracted. In high electric fields the doublet interacts with a third state at 17727 cm$^{-1}$, that connects to the ground state via an electric-dipole transition.

This architectural enhancement alone yields substantial performance gains, enabling NORA-1.5 to outperform NORA and several state-of-the-art VLA models across both simulated and real-world benchmarks. To further improve robustness and task success, we develop a set of reward models for post-training VLA policies. Our rewards combine (i) an action-conditioned world model (WM) that evaluates whether generated actions lead toward the desired goal, and (ii) a deviation-from-ground-truth heuristic that distinguishes good actions from poor ones. Using these reward signals, we construct preference datasets and adapt NORA-1.5 to target embodiments through direct preference optimization (DPO). Extensive evaluations show that reward-driven post-training consistently improves performance in both simulation and real-robot settings, demonstrating significant VLA model-reliability gains through simple yet effective reward models. Our findings highlight NORA-1.5 and reward-guided post-training as a viable path toward more dependable embodied agents suitable for real-world deployment."

    "abstract": "Quantum information theory is a rapidly growing area of math and physics that combines two independent theories, quantum mechanics and information theory. Quantum entanglement is a concept that was first proposed in the EPR paradox. In quantum mechanics, particles can be in superposition, meaning they are in multiple different states at once. It is not until the particle is measured that it is forced into a single state. However, it is possible that particles can be tied to other particles, meaning that the measurement of one particle will determine the measurement of the other particle. Entanglement is at the very core of quantum information theory. It is one of the core pieces that allows for the massive increase in computing power. For this paper, we decided to focus on demonstrating the mathematical method (the Schmidt decomposition) for determining if a system is entangled, and a demonstration of quantum entanglement's use (quantum teleportation) as well as a quick look at how to extend the uses of the Schmidt decomposition."

    "abstract": "Like visual processing, language processing is susceptible to illusions in which people systematically misperceive stimuli. In one such case--the comparative illusion (CI), e.g., More students have been to Russia than I have--comprehenders tend to judge the sentence as acceptable despite its underlying nonsensical comparison. Prior research has argued that this phenomenon can be explained as Bayesian inference over a noisy channel: the posterior probability of an interpretation of a sentence is proportional to both the prior probability of that interpretation and the likelihood of corruption into the observed (CI) sentence. Initial behavioral work has supported this claim by evaluating a narrow set of alternative interpretations of CI sentences and showing that comprehenders favor interpretations that are more likely to have been corrupted into the illusory sentence. In this study, we replicate and go substantially beyond this earlier work by directly predicting the strength of illusion with a quantitative model of the posterior probability of plausible interpretations, which we derive through a novel synthesis of statistical language models with human behavioral data. Our model explains not only the fine gradations in the strength of CI effects, but also a previously unexplained effect caused by pronominal vs. full noun phrase than-clause subjects. These findings support a noisy-channel theory of sentence comprehension by demonstrating that the theory makes novel predictions about the comparative illusion that bear out empirically. This outcome joins related evidence of noisy channel processing in both illusory and non-illusory contexts to support noisy channel inference as a unified computational-level theory of diverse language processing phenomena."

The electron phonon interaction is treated nonperturbatively using the Lang Firsov canonical transformation, while the electron electron interaction is incorporated at the mean field level. Keldysh nonequilibrium Greens function framework is used to study the transport properties, allowing us to calculate the spectral function, tunneling current, ad differential conductance of the trimer molecular transistor.

Across multicenter EHR narratives and public benchmarks, RareSeek R1 attains state of the art accuracy, robust generalization, and stability under noisy or overlapping phenotypes. Augmented retrieval yields the largest gains when narratives pair with prioritized variants by resolving ambiguity and aligning candidates to mechanisms. Human studies show performance on par with experienced physicians and consistent gains in assistive use.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework that can flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of input modalities. CCSD adopts a shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates two self-distillation strategies: (i) a hierarchical modality self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge across modality hierarchies to reduce semantic discrepancies, and (ii) a progressive modality combination distillation approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities by simulating gradual modality dropout during training.

While surface codes are well understood in terms of their logical operators and boundary behavior, much less is known about tile codes. In this work, we establish a natural and precise description of their logical operator space. We prove that, under mild assumptions, any tile code admits a canonical symplectic basis of logical operators supported along lattice boundaries, which can be generated efficiently by a simple cellular automaton with the number of update rules only depending on the non-locality of the tile code. Further, we develop algebraic and algebro-geometric frameworks for tile codes, by resolving them by translationally invariant Pauli stabilizer models and showing that they arise as derived sections of a Koszul complex on $\\mathbb{P}^1 \\times \\mathbb{P}^1$. Finally, we introduce the concept of derived automorphisms for quantum codes. These are automorphism-like operations that can exist even for codes that do not have symmetries. We explain how derived automorphisms can be implemented for tile codes in a low-overhead and fault-tolerant manner by extending the lattice on one side and shrinking it on the other. While this operation is trivial for the surface code, it induces a product of logical CNOT gates on the encoded information. Our results provide new structural insights into tile codes and lay the groundwork for tile codes as building blocks for fault-tolerant quantum computation."

    "abstract": "As the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) approaches operational status, optimising its imaging performance is critical. A differential piston, arising from either the adaptive optics (AO) control loop, thermomechanical effects, or other sources, significantly degrades the image quality and is detrimental to the telescope's overall performance. In a numerical simulation set-up, we propose a method for estimating the differential piston between the petals of the ELT's M4 mirror using images from a 2x2 Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SH-WFS), commonly used in the ELT's tomographic AO mode. We aim to identify the limitations of this approach by evaluating its sensitivity to various observing conditions and sources of noise. Using a deep learning model based on a ResNet architecture, we trained a neural network (NN) on simulated datasets to estimate the differential piston. We assessed the robustness of the method under various conditions, including variations in Strehl ratio, polychromaticity, and detector noise. The performance was quantified using the root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimated differential piston aberration. This method demonstrates the ability to extract differential piston information from 2x2 SH-WFS images. Temporal averaging of frames makes the differential piston signal emerge from the turbulence-induced speckle field and leads to a significant improvement in the RMSE calculation. As expected, better seeing conditions result in improved accuracy. Polychromaticity only degrades the performance by less than 5% compared to the monochromatic case. In a realistic scenario, detector noise is not a limiting factor, as the primary limitation rather arises from the need for sufficient speckle averaging. The network was also shown to be applicable to input images other than the 2x2 SH-WFS data."

Using data from 1,343 students across 15 cohorts (2004-2019) in a public engineering faculty in Argentina, we construct a leak-aware, multilevel feature set that incorporates national inflation indicators, lagged exposure to teacher strikes, and interaction terms between macro shocks and curriculum friction. Random Forest models with cohort-based validation demonstrate that macro features provide stable, non-trivial gains in early-semester dropout prediction (improvement in Macro F1 from 0.73 to 0.78), with inflation volatility at entry and a strike-weighted basic-cycle friction index amongst the most influential variables. Lag analysis reveals that strike exposure exerts its strongest association with dropout two to three semesters after the disruption (OR = 2.34), and that effects are concentrated in early, high-friction semesters. We then embed these empirical patterns into an agent-based model, defining scenarios for inflation-only, strikes-only, and combined crisis. Simulations reproduce three stylised facts: delayed strike effects, basic-cycle vulnerability, and non-linear amplification when inflation and strikes co-occur, with combined shocks generating dropout levels 18-23% higher than the sum of individual effects. We argue that teacher strikes and inflation operate as structurally mediated educational disruptors, acting through curriculum design and financial resilience rather than as isolated events. The framework contributes to multilevel dropout theory by demonstrating how macro-level shocks propagate through institutional structures to shape individual trajectories and provides empirically grounded tools for scenario planning in macroeconomically unstable contexts."

    "abstract": "4Hb-TaS_2, a van der Waals superlattice comprising alternate stacked Ising superconducting 1H-TaS_2 and cluster Mott insulating 1T-TaS_2, exhibits emergent properties beyond those of its constituent layers. Notable phenomena include time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconductivity and spontaneous vortex phases, which are driven by nontrivial interlayer interactions that remain debated. Using area-selective angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we provide direct spectroscopic evidence of such interaction by systematically probing the electronic structures of 1T- and 1H-terminted surfaces of 4Hb-TaS_2. The metallic states of subsurface 1H-layers are folded to the Brillouin zone center by the sqrt(13) by sqrt(13) modulation of the surface 1T-layer, forming chiral \"windmill\" Fermi surfaces via Umklapp scattering. These conducting states further hybridize with the incipient flat band of the surface 1T-layer, producing a Kondo-like peak at the Fermi level. Interlayer charge transfer induces distinct 3 by 3 and 2 by 2 charge orders on the surface and subsurface 1H-layers, respectively, which result in characteristic segmented Fermi surfaces and dichotomously shift the van Hove singularities. These findings reconcile the competing Kondo and Mott-Hubbard models in this material and emphasize the interplay of flat bands, van hove singularities, charge orders, and unconventional superconductivity in correlated superlattices."

The rotors are constrained to rotate in a plane about fixed pivot points and coupled by springs, such that in equilibrium, the neighboring rotors lie on opposite sides of the chain axis. The linearized limit of this model valid for small angular displacements, was first introduced by Kane and Lubensky (KL) as a topological mechanical insulator hosting zero-energy vibrational edge modes. We show that the linearized KL chain behaves as a thermal insulator at low temperature in both the topological phases with a finite band gap, and the heat current falls exponentially with the chain length. When the gap vanishes at the topological phase transition, the KL chain becomes a good thermal conductor and conducts heat ballistically. The chain of rotors for arbitrary angular displacements hosts nonlinear solitary waves and distinct topological mechanical phases. Our numerical analysis shows normal (diffusive) heat conduction in all topological phases of the nonlinear chain. Nevertheless, a finite thermal conductivity is achieved for different system sizes in different topological phases of this nonlinear chain."

We present DecNefLab, a modular and interpretable simulation framework that formalizes DecNef as a machine learning problem. Beyond providing a virtual laboratory, DecNefLab enables researchers to model, analyze and understand neurofeedback dynamics. Using latent variable generative models as simulated participants, DecNefLab allows direct observation of internal cognitive states and systematic evaluation of how different protocol designs and subject characteristics influence learning. We demonstrate how this approach can (i) reproduce empirical phenomena of DecNef learning, (ii) identify conditions under which DecNef feedback fails to induce learning, and (iii) guide the design of more robust and reliable DecNef protocols in silico before human implementation. In summary, DecNefLab bridges computational modeling and cognitive neuroscience, offering a principled foundation for methodological innovation, robust protocol design, and ultimately, a deeper understanding of DecNef-based brain modulation."

    "abstract": "The evolution of next-generation wireless networks has spurred the vigorous development of the low-altitude economy (LAE). To support this emerging field while remaining compatible with existing network architectures, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) based on 5G New Radio (NR) signals is regarded as a promising solution. However, merely leveraging standard 5G NR signals, such as the Synchronization Signal Block (SSB), presents fundamental limitations in sensing resolution. To address the issue, this paper proposes a two-stage coarse-to-fine sensing framework that utilizes standard 5G NR initial access signals augmented by a custom-designed sparse pilot structure (SPS) for high-precision unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) sensing. In Stage I, we first fuse information from the SSB, Type\\#0-PDCCH, and system information block 1 (SIB1) to ensure the initial target detection. In Stage II, a refined estimation algorithm is introduced to overcome the resolution limitations of these signals. Inspired by the sparse array theory, this stage employs a novel SPS, which is inserted into resource blocks (RBs) within the CORSET\\#0 bandwidth. To accurately extract the off-grid range and velocity parameters from these sparse pilots, we develop a corresponding high-resolution algorithm based on the weighted unwrapped phase (WUP) technique and the RELAX-based iterative method. Finally, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is adopted to prune the redundant detections arising from beam overlap. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate the superior estimation accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed framework in comparison to other techniques."

As stress accumulates, plastic avalanches can result in shear localization, characterized by adjacent parts of the system rotating in opposite directions, with the maximum shear localized between them. We derive an analytic theory that describes and explains the shear localization, providing a-priori predictions for the displacement field associated with the plastic drops and the shear localization."

    "abstract": "Underwater image restoration and enhancement are crucial for correcting color distortion and restoring image details, thereby establishing a fundamental basis for subsequent underwater visual tasks. However, current deep learning methodologies in this area are frequently constrained by the scarcity of high-quality paired datasets. Since it is difficult to obtain pristine reference labels in underwater scenes, existing benchmarks often rely on manually selected results from enhancement algorithms, providing debatable reference images that lack globally consistent color and authentic supervision. This limits the model's capabilities in color restoration, image enhancement, and generalization. To overcome this limitation, we propose using in-air natural images as unambiguous reference targets and translating them into underwater-degraded versions, thereby constructing synthetic datasets that provide authentic supervision signals for model learning. Specifically, we establish a generative data framework based on unpaired image-to-image translation, producing a large-scale dataset that covers 6 representative underwater degradation types. The framework constructs synthetic datasets with precise ground-truth labels, which facilitate the learning of an accurate mapping from degraded underwater images to their pristine scene appearances. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across 6 representative network architectures and 3 independent test sets show that models trained on our synthetic data achieve comparable or superior color restoration and generalization performance to those trained on existing benchmarks. This research provides a reliable and scalable data-driven solution for underwater image restoration and enhancement.

This unique capability opens new opportunities for a wide range of communication applications and emerging technologies. However, accurate channel state information (CSI) must be acquired before a fluid antenna can be effectively utilized. Although several efforts have been made toward channel reconstruction in FASs, a generally applicable solution to both model-based or model-free scenario with both high precision and efficient computational flow remains lacking. In this work, we propose a data-driven channel reconstruction approach enabled by neural networks. The proposed framework not only achieves significantly enhanced reconstruction accuracy but also requires substantially lower computational complexity compared with existing model-free methods. Numerical results further demonstrate the rapid convergence and robust reconstruction capability of the proposed scheme, outperforming current state-of-the-art techniques."

    "abstract": "The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is one of the most promising algorithms for current quantum devices. It employs a classical optimizer to iteratively update the parameters of a variational quantum circuit in order to search for the ground state of a given Hamiltonian. The efficacy of VQEs largely depends on the optimizer employed. Recent studies suggest that Quantum Natural Gradient Descent (QNG) can achieve faster convergence than vanilla gradient descent (VG), but at the cost of additional quantum resources to estimate Fubini-Study metric tensor in each optimization step. The Fubini-Study metric tensor used in QNG is related to the entire quantum state space and does not incorporate information about the target Hamiltonian. To take advantage of the structure of the Hamiltonian and address the limitation of additional computational cost in QNG, we propose Hamiltonian-aware Quantum Natural Gradient Descent (H-QNG). In H-QNG, we propose to use the Riemannian pullback metric induced from the lower-dimensional subspace spanned by the Hamiltonian terms onto the parameter space. We show that H-QNG inherits the desirable features of both approaches: the low quantum computational cost of VG and the reparameterization-invariance of QNG. We also validate its performance through numerical experiments on molecular Hamiltonians, showing that H-QNG achieves faster convergence to chemical accuracy while requiring fewer quantum computational resources."

However, despite its widespread use in practice, there is no common and unified formalism and every paper proposes different views of these stochastic mechanisms. With this in mind, we implement two simulation techniques and three unified, self-consistent inference techniques, which are widely used in the practical modeling of spatio-temporal Hawkes processes. Furthermore, we provide an evaluation of the practical performance of these methods, while providing useful code for reproducibility."

Such imprecision simultaneously increases the overall damage and prolongs the fire-brigades operation unnecessarily. We propose an automated assistance system for firefighting using a motorized fire monitor on a turntable ladder with aerial support from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV flies autonomously within an obstacle-free flight funnel derived from geodata, detecting and localizing heat sources. An operator supervises the operation on a handheld controller and selects a fire target in reach. After the selection, the UAV automatically plans and traverses between two triangulation poses for continued fire localization. Simultaneously, our system steers the fire monitor to ensure the water jet reaches the detected heat source. In preliminary tests, our assistance system successfully localized multiple heat sources and directed a water jet towards the fires."

    "abstract": "Communication compression is essential for scalable distributed training of modern machine learning models, but it often degrades convergence due to the noise it introduces. Error Feedback (EF) mechanisms are widely adopted to mitigate this issue of distributed compression algorithms. Despite their popularity and training efficiency, existing distributed EF algorithms often require prior knowledge of problem parameters (e.g., smoothness constants) to fine-tune stepsizes. This limits their practical applicability especially in large-scale neural network training. In this paper, we study normalized error feedback algorithms that combine EF with normalized updates, various momentum variants, and parameter-agnostic, time-varying stepsizes, thus eliminating the need for problem-dependent tuning. We analyze the convergence of these algorithms for minimizing smooth functions, and establish parameter-agnostic complexity bounds that are close to the best-known bounds with carefully-tuned problem-dependent stepsizes. Specifically, we show that normalized EF21 achieve the convergence rate of near ${O}(1/T^{1/4})$ for Polyak's heavy-ball momentum, ${O}(1/T^{2/7})$ for Iterative Gradient Transport (IGT), and ${O}(1/T^{1/3})$ for STORM and Hessian-corrected momentum. Our results hold with decreasing stepsizes and small mini-batches. Finally, our empirical experiments confirm our theoretical insights."

However, generalization is still a key limitation for the current system, which refers to the ability to handle unseen scenarios or unfamiliar sensor configurations.Related works have explored the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address few-shot or zero-shot tasks. While promising, these methods introduce a new challenge: the emergence of a hybrid AD system, where two distinct systems are used to plan a trajectory, leading to potential inconsistencies. Alternative research directions have explored Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks that generate control actions from VLM directly. However, these end-to-end solutions demonstrate prohibitive computational demands. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD), a novel framework that leverages VLMs to enhance the training of End-to-End (E2E) AD backbones. By providing risk attention for key objects, RSD addresses the issue of generalization. Specifically, we introduce RiskHead, a plug-in module that distills causal risk estimates from Vision-Language Models into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, yielding interpretable risk-attention maps.This approach allows BEV features to learn richer and more nuanced risk attention representations, which directly enhance the model's ability to handle spatial boundaries and risky objects.By focusing on risk attention, RSD aligns better with human-like driving behavior, which is essential to navigate in complex and dynamic environments. Our experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of RSD in managing complex and unpredictable driving conditions. Due to the enhanced BEV representations enabled by RSD, we observed a significant improvement in both perception and planning capabilities."

We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization.

To measure real-world generalization, we adopt leakage-safe blockwise hold-outs (vertical/horizontal) with safety buffers and report metrics only on held-out cores. Across two Greenland sub-regions, our approach achieves strong test-core accuracy and high structural fidelity, outperforming U-Net, Attention U-Net, FPN, and a plain CNN.

Analysis of its impact on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) revealed a complex, region-specific outcome: SNR increased in some regions (e.g., D2 Striatum: 3.41 dB to 6.25 dB), decreased in others (e.g., Thalamus VL: 6.24 dB to 3.93 dB), and remained stable elsewhere (e.g., M1: 3.16 dB to 3.13 dB). This heterogeneity stems from dopamine increasing the excitability of D1-receptor-expressing neurons, which amplifies channel conductance noise and reduces SNR in specific circuits. Thus, dopamine acts not as a uniform signal enhancer, but as a complex modulator that critically balances facilitation and noise within the CSTC loop."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly executed across edge, fog, and cloud tiers where limited GPU memory, heterogeneous compute, and variable inter-tier bandwidth jointly constrain deployment and motivate model partitioning and request scheduling. In this setting, achieving low end-to-end latency is governed not only by where a model is deployed (inter-tier model partitioning) but also by how incoming requests are scheduled (intra-tier task scheduling) across heterogeneous nodes. These two problems are tightly coupled, as a suboptimal scheduler can negate the benefits of a good partition, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose Hyperion, a hierarchical two-stage framework that jointly optimizes partitioning and scheduling to minimize end-to-end latency for pipelined LLM inference in multi-tier networks, balancing compute and memory across tiers while introducing negligible runtime overhead and requiring no model retraining. Motivated by the observation that partition choices evolve on slower timescales than request arrivals, Stage 1 performs offline, inter-tier partitioning via a Binary Search with Dynamic Programming (BSDP) procedure to produce balanced stage times under tier capacity and memory constraints; to adapt to time-varying load, Stage 2 performs online, intra-tier scheduling with a lightweight Adaptive Real-time Task Scheduling (ARTS) algorithm that maps each request to the best available node using real-time estimates of queue length and effective capacity. Experimental results on multi-tier inference tasks demonstrate that Hyperion significantly reduces end-to-end latency by up to 52.1\\% and 31.2\\%, with the Phi-3-medium model, compared to the GPipe and HEFT baselines, respectively. Furthermore, Hyperion shows superior scalability in long-sequence generation, maintaining a 44.5\\% lower latency than GPipe and achieving higher GPU utilization."

The 11-pole filter, implemented in YBa2Cu3O(7-x) (YBCO) thin films on sapphire, exhibits an ultra-low insertion loss (IL) of -0.1~dB, a sharp roll-off of 100~MHz, and a rejection level exceeding --80~dB. These measured results represent, to the best of our knowledge, the lowest reported IL for an S-band filter with this number of poles. When integrated with a cryogenic low-noise amplifier (LNA), system-level simulations and measurements predict a receiver noise figure (NF) of 0.34~dB at 3.39~GHz, enabling a 20% increase in radar detection range compared with conventional copper-based front ends. This work demonstrates the feasibility of practical HTSC-based RF front-ends for next-generation communication and radar systems."

The system integrates three components: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant for personalized, knowledge-grounded dialogue; (ii) a synthetic client-therapist dialogue generator conditioned on client profiles to facilitate research on therapeutic language and data augmentation; and (iii) a Well-being AI crew, implemented with CrewAI, that produces weekly self-care plans and guided meditation audio. The system is designed as a reflective space for emotional processing rather than a substitute for professional therapy. It illustrates how conversational assistants can lower barriers to support, complement existing care, and broaden access to mental health resources. To address the shortage of confidential therapeutic data, we introduce synthetic client-therapist dialogue generation conditioned on client profiles. Finally, the planner demonstrates an innovative agentic workflow for dynamically adaptive, personalized self-care, bridging the limitations of static well-being tools. We describe the architecture, demonstrate its functionalities, and report evaluation of the RAG assistant in curated well-being scenarios using both automatic LLM-based judgments and a human-user study. This work highlights opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration between NLP researchers and mental health professionals to advance responsible innovation in human-AI interaction for well-being."

In this paper, we contribute the Safe-ROS architecture for developing reliable and verifiable autonomous robots in such domains. It features two distinct subsystems: (1) an intelligent control system that is responsible for normal/routine operations, and (2) a Safety System consisting of Safety Instrumented Functions (SIFs) that provide formally verifiable independent oversight. We demonstrate Safe-ROS on an AgileX Scout Mini robot performing autonomous inspection in a nuclear environment. One safety requirement is selected and instantiated as a SIF. To support verification, we implement the SIF as a cognitive agent, programmed to stop the robot whenever it detects that it is too close to an obstacle. We verify that the agent meets the safety requirement and integrate it into the autonomous inspection. This integration is also verified, and the full deployment is validated in a Gazebo simulation, and lab testing. We evaluate this architecture in the context of the UK nuclear sector, where safety and regulation are crucial aspects of deployment. Success criteria include the development of a formal property from the safety requirement, implementation, and verification of the SIF, and the integration of the SIF into the operational robotic autonomous system. Our results demonstrate that the Safe-ROS architecture can provide safety verifiable oversight while deploying autonomous robots in safety-critical domains, offering a robust framework that can be extended to additional requirements and various applications."

    "abstract": "Industrial robotic systems (IRS) are increasingly deployed in diverse environments, where failures can result in severe accidents and costly downtime. Ensuring the reliability of the software controlling these systems is therefore critical. Mutation testing, a technique widely used in software engineering, evaluates the effectiveness of test suites by introducing small faults, or mutants, into the code. However, traditional mutation operators are poorly suited to robotic programs, which involve message-based commands and interactions with the physical world. This paper explores the adaptation of mutation testing to IRS by defining domain-specific mutation operators that capture the semantics of robot actions and sensor readings. We propose a methodology for generating meaningful mutants at the level of high-level read and write operations, including movement, gripper actions, and sensor noise injection. An empirical study on a pick-and-place scenario demonstrates that our approach produces more informative mutants and reduces the number of invalid or equivalent cases compared to conventional operators. Results highlight the potential of mutation testing to enhance test suite quality and contribute to safer, more reliable industrial robotic systems."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into educational applications. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks, which can compromise safety alignment and lead to harmful outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on general safety evaluations, with limited attention to the unique safety requirements of educational scenarios. To address this gap, we construct EduHarm, a benchmark containing safe-unsafe instruction pairs across five representative educational scenarios, enabling systematic safety evaluation of educational LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage shield framework (TSSF) for educational LLMs that simultaneously mitigates both jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks. First, safety-aware attention realignment redirects attention toward critical unsafe tokens, thereby restoring the harmfulness feature that discriminates between unsafe and safe inputs. Second, layer-wise safety judgment identifies harmfulness features by aggregating safety cues across multiple layers to detect unsafe instructions. Finally, defense-driven dual routing separates safe and unsafe queries, ensuring normal processing for benign inputs and guarded responses for harmful ones. Extensive experiments across eight jailbreak attack strategies demonstrate that TSSF effectively strengthens safety while preventing over-refusal of benign queries. Evaluations on three fine-tuning attack datasets further show that it consistently achieves robust defense against harmful queries while maintaining preserving utility gains from benign fine-tuning."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "Recently, the general-to-customized paradigm has emerged as the dominant approach for Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR), which reconciles the distribution shift problem between the source domain and the target domain. However, existing general-to-customized CMR methods typically assume that the entire target-domain data is available, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios and thus inevitably suffer from the query shift (QS) problem. Specifically, query shift embraces the following two characteristics and thus poses new challenges to CMR. i) Online Shift: real-world queries always arrive in an online manner, rendering it impractical to access the entire query set beforehand for customization approaches; ii) Diverse Shift: even with domain customization, the CMR models struggle to satisfy queries from diverse users or scenarios, leaving an urgent need to accommodate diverse queries. In this paper, we observe that QS would not only undermine the well-structured common space inherited from the source model, but also steer the model toward forgetting the indispensable general knowledge for CMR. Inspired by the observations, we propose a novel method for achieving online and harmonious adaptation against QS, dubbed Robust adaptation with quEry ShifT (REST). To deal with online shift, REST first refines the retrieval results to formulate the query predictions and accordingly designs a QS-robust objective function on these predictions to preserve the well-established common space in an online manner. As for tackling the more challenging diverse shift, REST employs a gradient decoupling module to dexterously manipulate the gradients during the adaptation process, thus preventing the CMR model from forgetting the general knowledge. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across three CMR tasks verify the effectiveness of our method against QS."

To this end, we propose a lightweight TTA model specialized in speech semantics for more effective LLM integration. With large-scale training of 358k hours of speech data on multilingual speech recognition (ASR), speech translation (ST) and speech-text alignment tasks, TTA is capable of producing robust cross-lingual speech representations. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks, including ASR/ST, speech retrieval, and ASR-LLM performance assessments, demonstrate TTA's superiority over Whisper. Furthermore, we rigorously validate the interplay between cross-lingual capabilities and ASR/ST performance. The model weights and training recipes of TTA will be released as part of an audio understanding toolkit Auden."

The radius of the ambiguity set is measured via convex spectral divergence. We demonstrate that the proposed distributionally robust estimation model can be reduced to a convex optimization problem, thereby yielding quasi-analytical estimators. The joint estimators are shown to be nonlinear shrinkage estimators. The eigenvalues of the estimators are shrunk nonlinearly towards a positive scalar, where the scalar is determined by the weight coefficient of the loss terms. By tuning the coefficient carefully, the shrinkage corrects the spectral bias of the empirical covariance/precision matrix estimator. By this property, we call the proposed joint estimator the Spectral concentrated COvariance and Precision matrix Estimator (SCOPE). We demonstrate that the shrinkage effect improves the condition number of the estimator. We provide a parameter-tuning scheme that adjusts the shrinkage target and intensity that is asymptotically optimal. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data show that our shrinkage estimators perform competitively against state-of-the-art estimators in practical applications."

We present HyperABSA, a dynamic hypergraph framework that induces aspect-opinion structures through sample-specific hierarchical clustering. To construct these hyperedges, we introduce a novel acceleration-fallback cutoff for hierarchical clustering, which adaptively determines the level of granularity. Experiments on three benchmarks (Lap14, Rest14, MAMS) show consistent improvements over strong graph baselines, with substantial gains when paired with RoBERTa backbones.

Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark. This pronounced enhancement highlights the effectiveness of our method in handling challenging VLN tasks."

To address these challenges, we present 10Cache, a resource-aware tensor caching and migration system that accelerates LLM training by intelligently coordinating memory usage across GPU, CPU, and NVMe tiers. 10Cache profiles tensor execution order to construct prefetch policies, allocates memory buffers in pinned memory based on tensor size distributions, and reuses memory buffers to minimize allocation overhead. Designed for cloud-scale deployments, 10Cache improves memory efficiency and reduces reliance on high-end GPUs. Across diverse LLM workloads, it achieves up to 2x speedup in training time, improves GPU cache hit rate by up to 86.6x, and increases CPU/GPU memory utilization by up to 2.15x and 1.33x, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art offloading methods.

    "abstract": "Pedestrian-vehicle incidents remain a critical urban safety challenge, with pedestrians accounting for over 20% of global traffic fatalities. Although existing video-based systems can detect when incidents occur, they provide little insight into how these events unfold across the distinct cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for video understanding, but they remain limited in that they typically process videos in isolation, without explicit temporal structuring or multi-view integration. This paper introduces Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning (MP-PVIR), a unified framework that systematically processes multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports through four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. The framework operationalizes behavioral theory by automatically segmenting incidents into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis within each phase, and synthesizing results into causal chains with targeted prevention strategies. Particularly, two specialized VLMs underpin the MP-PVIR pipeline: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, achieving a captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. Finally, a designated large language model is used to generate comprehensive reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations. Evaluation on the Woven Traffic Safety dataset shows that MP-PVIR effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights, advancing AI-driven traffic safety analytics for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems."

I allow the space of all signals the data broker can sell to be arbitrarily correlated with the signal the decision maker owns. This plays a key role in designing the optimal menu. In the binary action setting, the data broker extracts the efficient surplus by offering a distinct binary signal for each type. Moreover, this result holds even when the broker does not know the prior distribution over states.

    "abstract": "The immense memory requirements of state-of-the-art Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models present a significant challenge for inference, often exceeding the capacity of a single accelerator. While offloading experts to host memory is a common solution, it introduces a severe I/O bottleneck over the PCIe bus, as the data-dependent nature of expert selection places these synchronous transfers directly on the critical path of execution, crippling performance. This paper argues that the I/O bottleneck can be overcome by trading a small amount of cheap, on-device computation to hide the immense cost of data movement. We present MoE-SpeQ, a new inference system built on a novel co-design of speculative execution and expert offloading. MoE-SpeQ employs a small, on-device draft model to predict the sequence of required experts for future tokens. This foresight enables a runtime orchestrator to prefetch these experts from host memory, effectively overlapping the expensive I/O with useful computation and hiding the latency from the critical path. To maximize performance, an adaptive governor, guided by an Amortization Roofline Model, dynamically tunes the speculation strategy to the underlying hardware. Our evaluation on memory-constrained devices shows that for the Phi-MoE model, MoE-SpeQ achieves at most 2.34x speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading framework. Our work establishes a new, principled approach for managing data-dependent memory access in resource-limited environments, making MoE inference more accessible on commodity hardware."

While existing methods can modify video content if explicit descriptions of editing targets with precise spatial locations and temporal boundaries are provided, these requirements become impractical when users attempt to conceptualize edits through implicit queries referencing semantic properties or object relationships. We introduce reasoning video editing, a task where video editing models must interpret implicit queries through multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets before executing modifications, and a first model attempting to solve this complex task, RIVER (Reasoning-based Implicit Video Editor). RIVER decouples reasoning from generation through digital twin representations of video content that preserve spatial relationships, temporal trajectories, and semantic attributes. A large language model then processes this representation jointly with the implicit query, performing multi-hop reasoning to determine modifications, then outputs structured instructions that guide a diffusion-based editor to execute pixel-level changes. RIVER training uses reinforcement learning with rewards that evaluate reasoning accuracy and generation quality. Finally, we introduce RVEBenchmark, a benchmark of 100 videos with 519 implicit queries spanning three levels and categories of reasoning complexity specifically for reasoning video editing. RIVER demonstrates best performance on the proposed RVEBenchmark and also achieves state-of-the-art performance on two additional video editing benchmarks (VegGIE and FiVE), where it surpasses six baseline methods."

These plans guide a LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (LoRA-MoE) module within a diffusion-based executor, which dynamically selects high- or low-frequency experts, complemented by frequency features of the input image. To further improve restoration quality and reduce artifacts, we introduce adversarial training and a frequency regularization loss.

    "abstract": "Integer-valued generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (INGARCH) models are a popular framework for modeling serial dependence in count time-series. While convenient for modeling, prediction, and estimation, INGARCH models lack a clear theoretical justification for the evolution step. This limitation not only makes interpretation difficult and complicates the inclusion of covariates, but can also make the handling of missing data computationally burdensome. Consequently, applying such models in an insurance context, where covariates and missing observations are common, can be challenging. In this paper, we first introduce the marginalized state-space model (M-SSM), defined solely through the marginal distribution of the observations, and show that INGARCH models arise as special cases of this framework. The M-SSM formulation facilitates the natural incorporation of covariates and missing data mechanisms, and this representation in turn provides a coherent way to incorporate these elements within the INGARCH model as well. We then demonstrate that an M-SSM can admit an observation-driven state-space model (O-SSM) representation when suitable assumptions are imposed on the evolution of its conditional mean. This lifting from an M-SSM to an O-SSM provides a natural setting for establishing weak stationarity, even in the presence of heterogeneity and missing observations. The proposed ideas are illustrated through the Poisson and the Negative-Binomial INGARCH(1,1) models, highlighting their applicability in predictive analysis for insurance data."

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation underpins computer-aided diagnosis and therapy by supporting clinical diagnosis, preoperative planning, and disease monitoring. While U-Net style convolutional neural networks perform well due to their encoder-decoder structures with skip connections, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies. Transformer-based variants address global context but often require heavy computation and large training datasets. This paper proposes GCA-ResUNet, an efficient segmentation network that integrates Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) into ResNet-50 residual blocks. GCA uses grouped coordinate modeling to jointly encode global dependencies across channels and spatial locations, strengthening feature representation and boundary delineation while adding minimal parameter and FLOP overhead compared with self-attention. On the Synapse dataset, GCA-ResUNet achieves a Dice score of 86.11%, and on the ACDC dataset, it reaches 92.64%, surpassing several state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining fast inference and favorable computational efficiency. These results indicate that GCA offers a practical way to enhance convolutional architectures with global modeling capability, enabling high-accuracy and resource-efficient medical image segmentation."

    "abstract": "Despite recent progress in 3D-LLMs, they remain limited in accurately grounding language to visual and spatial elements in 3D environments. This limitation stems in part from training data that focuses on language reasoning rather than spatial understanding due to scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved. To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured \"Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train\" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches. Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation). It then executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits, such as recoloring or repositioning, to produce targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy. We evaluate our editing pipeline across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks, consistently demonstrating improvements across all evaluated datasets through iterative refinement. DEER-3D underscores the effectiveness of targeted, error-driven scene editing in bridging linguistic reasoning capabilities with spatial grounding in 3D LLMs."

For B1 (NaCl-type) phase, CMRT gives an equation of state consistent with ambient pressure experiments. It produces electronic density-of-state (DOS) characterized by a sharp 4f quasi-particle resonance peak pinned at the Fermi level and two subbands formed by strong hybridization between the localized Ce-4f electrons and the itinerant Ce-5d and N-2p electrons below the Fermi level, consistent with XPS experiments. Upon compression, CMRT predicts a first-order B1 to B2 (CsCl-type) transition with ~11% volume collapse. Across the transition, the 4f spectral weight broadens, the 4f orbital occupancy increases, and the hybridization with conduction states enhances, signaling a crossover from partially localized to more itinerant 4f behavior. These features are in excellent agreement with experimental observations, demonstrating that CMRT provides a parameter-free description and prediction of correlation-driven structural and electronic transitions in rare-earth compounds."

    "abstract": "Reliable measurement of glenoid bone loss is essential for operative planning in shoulder instability, but current manual and semi-automated methods are time-consuming and often subject to interreader variability. We developed and validated a fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans using a linear-based, en-face view, best-circle method. Shoulder CT images of 91 patients (average age, 40 years; range, 14-89 years; 65 men) were retrospectively collected along with manual labels including glenoid segmentation, landmarks, and bone loss measurements. The multi-stage algorithm has three main stages: (1) segmentation, where we developed a U-Net to automatically segment the glenoid and humerus; (2) anatomical landmark detection, where a second network predicts glenoid rim points; and (3) geometric fitting, where we applied principal component analysis (PCA), projection, and circle fitting to compute the percentage of bone loss. The automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and exceeded surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.84 vs 0.78), including in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21, respectively; P < 0.001). For classifying patients into low, medium, and high bone-loss categories, the pipeline achieved a recall of 0.714 for low and 0.857 for high severity, with no low cases misclassified as high or vice versa. These results suggest that our method is a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and for screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss.

The method of supervised neural networks (NN) is employed for the investigation. While supervised NN is used, no real spin configurations are needed for the training. In addition, two kinds of configurations having their spins be arranged in a staggered pattern are considered as the training set. Remarkably, with this unconventional training strategy, not only the critical temperatures of the studied $J_2/J_1$ are computed accurately by the resulting NN, but also the nature of the investigated phase transitions are determined correctly. Specifically, the phase transitions associated with $J_2/J_1 = 0.1, 0.5$ and 1.0 are first order. These conclusions are consistent with the known results obtained by other methods. Since the training strategy is simple, the NN calculations is highly efficient. It remains to examine whether the unconventional training approach considered in this study can be used to investigate other models with untypical phase transitions or with nontrivial ground state configurations."

Observations revealed a preflare sigmoidal structure and a circular flare ribbon surrounding the typical two ribbon structure, along with remote brightenings located at a considerable distance from the main flare site. To interpret these observations in terms of the three dimensional (3D) coronal magnetic field dynamics, we conducted data constrained magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. Using a non linear force free field (NLFFF) as the initial condition, we reconstructed a realistic pre flare magnetic environment, capturing a sheared sigmoid above the polarity inversion line (PIL) surmounted by a fan spine structure. Our simulations revealed that reconnection between the sigmoidal field, the adjacent fan dome field lines, and the neighboring large loops facilitated the transfer of magnetic twist and led to the formation of a large magnetic flux rope (MFR). This transfer and propagation of twist are clearly visible throughout the MFR. As reconnection progresses, the entire fan spine structure expands along with the evolving MFR. A notable outcome of the simulation is that the footpoints of the newly formed MFR align closely with the observed circular flare ribbon and the remote brightening region. Our findings suggest that a large MFR formed during the X2.1 flare, providing a coherent explanation for the observed phenomena."

Crucially, the solution is exclusively supported by the phantom branch of the DBI action, dynamically replacing the central singularity with a regular core. The solution is asymptotically flat, possesses non-trivial scalar hair, and replaces the central singularity with a regular 2-sphere. The mechanism for singularity resolution is a dynamical kinetic stiffness -- analogous to shear thickening in non-Newtonian fluids -- which also explains the evasion of classical no-hair theorems. We show these black holes evaporate to a stable, non-singular, extremal Planck-scale relic. This provides a robust mechanism to evade standard evaporation constraints, opening a vast, previously forbidden mass window for light Primordial Black Holes to constitute dark matter. The model is testable via distinctive gravitational-wave signatures from its scalar hair."

    "abstract": "The *algebrization barrier*, proposed by Aaronson and Wigderson (STOC '08, ToCT '09), captures the limitations of many complexity-theoretic techniques based on arithmetization. Notably, several circuit lower bounds that overcome the relativization barrier (Buhrman--Fortnow--Thierauf, CCC '98; Vinodchandran, TCS '05; Santhanam, STOC '07, SICOMP '09) remain subject to the algebrization barrier. In this work, we establish several new algebrization barriers to circuit lower bounds by studying the communication complexity of the following problem, called XOR-Missing-String: For $m < 2^{n/2}$, Alice gets a list of $m$ strings $x_1, \\dots, x_m\\in\\{0, 1\\}^n$, Bob gets a list of $m$ strings $y_1, \\dots, y_m\\in\\{0, 1\\}^n$, and the goal is to output a string $s\\in\\{0, 1\\}^n$ that is not equal to $x_i\\oplus y_j$ for any $i, j\\in [m]$. 1. We construct an oracle $A_1$ and its multilinear extension $\\widetilde{A_1}$ such that ${\\sf PostBPE}^{\\widetilde{A_1}}$ has linear-size $A_1$-oracle circuits on infinitely many input lengths. 2.

Finally, we study algebrization barriers to circuit lower bounds for $\\sf MA_E$. Buhrman, Fortnow, and Thierauf proved a *sub-half-exponential* circuit lower bound for $\\sf MA_E$ via algebrizing techniques. Toward understanding whether the half-exponential bound can be improved, we define a natural subclass of $\\sf MA_E$ that includes their hard $\\sf MA_E$ language, and prove the following result: For every *super-half-exponential* function $h(n)$, we construct an oracle $A_3$ and its multilinear extension $\\widetilde{A_3}$ such that this natural subclass of ${\\sf MA}_{\\sf E}^{\\widetilde{A_3}}$ has $h(n)$-size $A_3$-oracle circuits on all input lengths."

For each hire, we collected data about their background and experiences, the previous success as a head coach or coordinator and their success since hiring. Over 50 variables on these factors were recorded though we used 29 of these in building our predictive model. Our measure of success is based upon Bill Connelly's SP+ team ratings relative to the performance on the same metric of the school in the 15 year prior to their selection as head coach. Using a cross-validated regularized linear regression, we obtain a predictive model for coaching success. Among the important factors for predicting a successful hire are having been a previous college head coach, having won a prior conference championship as a head coach, leaving a job as an Offensive Coordinator, age and quality of the hiring school's team in the previous 15 years. While we do find these factors are important for the prediction of a successful coaching hire, the trends here are weak. With 66% accuracy, the model does identify coaching hires that will outperform team performance in the 15 years before the hire. However, no combination of these factors leads to high predictability of identifying a successful coaching hire. All of the data and code for this paper are available in a Github repository."

In this paper, I motivate the necessity of incorporating insights from Physics, and also show that trade as a phenomenon described by the comparative advantage theory cannot exist without the law of conservation of Energy, and incorporating this law leads to axiomatic completeness of the theory. Further, I also argue that while the economy is not a zero-sum game in terms of wealth, it does require at least one associated zero-sum parameter for trade and economy as phenomena to exist."

Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches. We validate WaRPAD on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and images generated by 23 different generative models. Our method consistently achieves competitive performance and demonstrates strong robustness to test-time corruptions. Furthermore, as invariance to RandomResizedCrop is a common training scheme across self-supervised models, we show that WaRPAD is applicable across self-supervised models."

In this paper we study, at system scale and across several widely used repositories, how to keep such a model fresh without surrendering retention on earlier code. We frame freshness as a form of domain drift between a base snapshot and the current HEAD, and we compare three families of update strategies: (A) Full Refresh, retraining the entire model at the new snapshot; (B) In-Context Learning (ICL) that injects recent deltas (raw git diffs or concise English summaries) at inference; and (C) Incremental Fine-Tuning (Inc-FT) on delta-derived training sets, with carefully controlled NEW:OLD mixing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We contribute an alias-aware evaluation protocol that credits rename while never rewarding deleted paths, and a practical Forgetting Probe that quantifies residual emissions of obsolete paths. Across Flask, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Poetry, Inc-FT with old-aware mixes delivers the best overall balance on mixed sets, ICL with English delta summaries delivers the fastest new-code lift when training is not feasible, and Full Refresh remains the ceiling when maximum NEW accuracy matters. We also compare Git-diff Inc-FT to full-file Inc-FT, showing that diffs excel in rename/delete-heavy windows while full-file context wins in behavior-change-heavy windows."

Evaluation on real-world flaky tests from industrial repositories shows that FlakyGuard repairs 47.6 % of reproducible flaky tests with 51.8 % of the fixes accepted by developers.

We present the first analysis of the influence of LoRA on state-of-the-art backdoor attacks targeting model adaptation in FL. Specifically, we focus on backdoor lifespan, a critical characteristic in FL, that can vary depending on the attack scenario and the attacker's ability to effectively inject the backdoor. A key finding in our experiments is that for an optimally injected backdoor, the backdoor persistence after the attack is longer when the LoRA's rank is lower. Importantly, our work highlights evaluation issues of backdoor attacks against FL and contributes to the development of more robust and fair evaluations of backdoor attacks, enhancing the reliability of risk assessments for critical FL systems.

A key innovation of our model is the introduction of a one-dimensional convolution-based token compression module. We dynamically adjust the compression rate during training, enabling the model to learn more robust and efficient compressed text representations. By combining knowledge distillation with token compression techniques, we achieve significant improvements in both embedding quality and inference efficiency.

    "abstract": "We show that a metric $f$-manifold $(M^{2n+s}, φ, ξ_i, η_j, g)$ satisfying the property $[ξ_i, ξ_j]=0$ for all $i, j\\in\\{1, \\ldots, s\\}$ admits a metric connection $\\nabla$ with skew-torsion $T$ preserving the structure if and only if each Reeb vector field $ξ_i$ is Killing and the Nijenhuis tensor $N^{(1)}$ is totally skew-symmetric. The connection is then uniquely determined and its torsion 3-form $T$ is given by \\[ T=\\sum_{i=1}^{s}η_{i}\\wedge{\\rm d}η_i+{\\rm d}^φF+N^{(1)}-\\sum_{i=1}^{s}(η_{i}\\wedge(ξ_i\\lrcorner N^{(1)}))\\,, \\] where ${\\rm d}^φF:=-{\\rm d} F\\circφ$. This provides a natural higher-dimensional generalization of the adapted connections with skew-torsion on almost Hermitian manifolds (case $s=0$) and almost contact metric manifolds (case $s=1$) presented in [FrIv]. We further prove that a contact metric $f$-manifold $(M^{2n+s}, φ, ξ_i, η_j, g)$, also known as an almost $\\mathcal{S}$-manifold, admits such a connection if and only if $M^{2n+s}$ is an $\\mathcal{S}$-manifold, that is, a normal contact metric $f$-manifold. In this case we show that the torsion 3-form $T$, which is given by $T=\\sum_{i=1}^{s}η_{i}\\wedge{\\rm d}η_i$, is $\\nabla$-parallel. Thus, for $s\\geq 2$, we construct a broad new class of geometries with parallel skew-torsion in all dimensions $\\geq 4$, both even and odd. These geometries differ from the Sasakian case ($s=1$) also by the fact that their torsion 3-form $T$ is degenerate. We finally describe examples with $s=2$, $s=3$ and $s=4$, relying on the Lie groups ${\\mathsf{U}}(2)$ and ${\\mathsf{U}}(3)$, and a construction of $\\mathcal{S}$-manifolds presented in [DL05]. For the latter case and the case of ${\\mathsf{U}}(2)$ we compute the holonomy algebra of the connection $\\nabla$ and show that $\\nabla$ is an Ambrose-Singer connection, that is, $\\nabla T=0=\\nabla R^{\\nabla}$."

We determine these corrections and their associated correlated uncertainties using a methodology based on the theory covariance formalism, previously used to account for nuclear uncertainties and missing higher order uncertainties (MHOUs) in global PDF determinations. We then study the impact of the power corrections on the extracted PDFs, and demonstrate an improved description of the data due to a reduced sensitivity to DIS data in the low-$x$ region where higher twist uncertainties are relatively large, and a reduced sensitivity to single inclusive jet data at relatively low $p_T$, where linear power corrections can be significant. Finally, we assess the impact of power corrections on observables relevant to LHC phenomenology, including Higgs production via gluon fusion, and the determination of $α_s$. We find that these effects, while small, can be significant, improving perturbative convergence."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are powerful zero- and few-shot learners. However, when predicting over a set of candidate options, LLMs suffer from label biases, and existing calibration methods overlook biases arising from multi-token class labels. We tackle an issue we call label length bias, where labels of different lengths are treated inconsistently, even after standard length normalization. To mitigate it, we propose normalized contextual calibration (NCC), an effective method that normalizes and calibrates predictions at the full-label level. NCC achieves statistically significant improvements over prior approaches across multiple datasets and models, with gains of up to 10% F1. Moreover, NCC extends bias mitigation to broader tasks such as multiple-choice question answering. Our analysis shows that, when combined with in-context learning, NCC is less sensitive to few-shot example selection, requires fewer examples for competitive performance, and produces more reliable confidence estimates. These findings highlight the importance of mitigating full-label biases to improve the performance and robustness of LLM-based methods, particularly in real-world applications where class labels naturally consist of multiple tokens."

The method quantifies shoulder yaw and roll using only the 3D coordinates of two shoulder landmarks provided by common pose estimation frameworks. The algorithm was evaluated on a dataset of 121 portrait images. The resulting SPE scores demonstrated a strong Pearson correlation (r approx. 0.80) with human-assigned labels. An analysis of the metric's filtering performance, using an adapted Error-versus-Discard methodology, confirmed its utility in identifying non-compliant samples. The proposed algorithm is a viable lightweight tool for automated compliance checking in enrolment systems."

The synergy between close binary stars and asteroseismology enables constraints on mass-transfer episodes and their consequences for internal structure, rotation profiles, and oscillation modes. Aims. We investigate how mass accretion and donation in close binaries affects the internal structure and oscillation modes of main-sequence stars. Methods. Building on the established relation between the BruntVaisala (buoyancy) glitch and the Fourier spectra of g-mode period spacings presented in Wu et al. and Guo, we quantitatively explain the origins of the g-mode period-spacing differences between single-star and mass-accretion/donation models of intermediate-mass stars (M = 2.0, 3.0, and 4.5 Msun). In particular, the hydrogen mass fraction profiles X of the donor model show two chemical gradient regions, which results in a double-peaked BruntVaisala profile. The presence of additional buoyancy glitches gives rise to further periodic modulations in the g-mode period spacings. Results. Mass-accretion induced changes in the chemical profile create sharp features in the buoyancy frequency, which modify both the amplitudes and frequencies of the g-mode period-spacing variations. This behavior resembles that produced by multiple chemical transition zones in compact pulsators such as white dwarfs and sub-dwarf B (sdB) stars. Similarly, for acoustic modes in the M = 1 Msun solar-like models, we attribute the differences in frequency-separation ratios between single-star and mass-donor models to the variations in the internal sound-speed gradient (acoustic glitches). We discuss future prospects for using asteroseismology to discover the mass-transfer products and constrain the mass-transfer processes in binary star evolution."

This study investigates how cognitive capability and personality traits jointly relate to software problem solving among 80 participants (40 software practitioners, 40 software engineering students). Cognitive capability was measured using Baddeleys three minute grammatical reasoning test, while personality was assessed using the IPIP NEO 50 test. Participants further completed nine interview style problem solving questions. Six questions were related to coding and three were related to logical reasoning. Descriptive and correlational analyses show that practitioners achieved slightly higher grammatical reasoning accuracy and overall task performance than students. Grammatical-reasoning accuracy correlated positively with problem solving performance, indicating that stronger cognitive capability is associated with better performance in coding and logical tasks. Personality performance links were systematic. We identified that the conscientiousness trait correlated most strongly with problem solving and with reasoning accuracy, while the openness to experience trait was positively related to both outcomes. Neuroticism showed small, negative associations with accuracy and performance. Taken together, our results suggest that conscientiousness and openness to experience characteristics complement reasoning accuracy to support software problem solving, whereas elevated negative affect may hinder precision under time pressure. Our findings suggest practical implications for education and industry such as integrating structured reasoning tasks in curricula, and considering personality cognition in recruitment and role allocation. We highlight directions for future research such as longitudinal and task diverse replications with larger samples."

We develop an oracle analysis of the changepoint detection problem which reveals an interesting relationship between the true changepoint locations and the local maxima of the oracle MMD curve. The proposed algorithms are shown to detect general distributional changes by exploiting this connection. In the unsupervised case, we test the significance of a potential changepoint and establish its consistency under the single changepoint setting. We investigate the strong consistency of the changepoint estimators in both single and multiple changepoint settings. In both supervised and semi-supervised scenarios, we include a step to merge consecutive groups that are similar to appropriately utilize the prior information about the number of changepoints. In the supervised scenario, the algorithm satisfies an order-preserving property: the estimated changepoints are contained in the true set of changepoints in the underspecified case, while they contain the true set under overspecification. We evaluate the performance of the algorithms on a variety of datasets demonstrating the superiority of the proposed algorithms compared to some of the existing methods."

    "abstract": "Robust data-driven controllers typically rely on datasets from previous experiments, which embed information on the variability of the system parameters across past operational conditions. Complementarily, data collected online can contribute to improving the feedback performance relative to the current system's conditions, but are unable to account for the overall -- possibly time-varying -- system operation. With this in mind, we consider the problem of stabilizing a time-varying linear system, whose parameters are only known to lie within a bounded polytopic set. Taking a robust data-driven approach, we synthesize the control law by simultaneously leveraging two sets of historical state and input measures: an offline dataset -- which covers the extreme variations of the system parameters -- and an online dataset consisting of a rolling window of the latest state and input samples. Our approach relies on the data informativity framework: we thus relax persistent excitation requirements (i.e., the collected samples need not be sufficient for system identification), while still allowing for the design of a stabilizing controller. The state feedback law is obtained from standard Lyapunov arguments, implemented via semi-definite optimization: this also yields an upper bound on the cost-to-go for the class of systems that are consistent with the online data, while guaranteeing a decreasing cost for all systems compatible with the offline data. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller."

Moreover, we introduce a new necessary condition for the existence of such bounded pressure functions, which in the special case of a uniform density state reduces to the classical Buchdahl limit on the stellar mass-radius relationship. We present various examples to study the stellar mass-radius relationships resulting from our new conditions."

    "abstract": "Tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) is a promising tool for multi-dimensional image representation, which decomposes a multi-dimensional image into a latent tensor and an accompanying transform matrix. However, two critical limitations of t-SVD methods persist: (1) the approximation of the latent tensor (e.g., tensor factorizations) is coarse and fails to accurately capture spatial local high-frequency information; (2) The transform matrix is composed of fixed basis atoms (e.g., complex exponential atoms in DFT and cosine atoms in DCT) and cannot precisely capture local high-frequency information along the mode-3 fibers. To address these two limitations, we propose a Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor Representation (GSLR) framework, which compactly and continuously represents multi-dimensional images. Specifically, we leverage tailored 2D Gaussian splatting and 1D Gaussian splatting to generate the latent tensor and transform matrix, respectively. The 2D and 1D Gaussian splatting are indispensable and complementary under this representation framework, which enjoys a powerful representation capability, especially for local high-frequency information. To evaluate the representation ability of the proposed GSLR, we develop an unsupervised GSLR-based multi-dimensional image recovery model. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional image recovery demonstrate that GSLR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in capturing local high-frequency information."

Microstructure characterization and reconstruction provide effective means for modeling these materials, which are critical for conducting physical property simulations, structure-property linkage studies, and enhancing their performance across different applications. To achieve superior controllability and applicability with small sample sizes, we propose a statistically controllable microstructure reconstruction framework that integrates neural networks with sliced-Wasserstein metric. Specifically, our approach leverages local pattern distribution for microstructure characterization and employs a controlled sampling strategy to generate target distributions that satisfy given conditional parameters. A neural network-based model establishes the mapping from the input distribution to the target local pattern distribution, enabling microstructure reconstruction. Combinations of sliced-Wasserstein metric and gradient optimization techniques minimize the distance between these distributions, leading to a stable and reliable model. Our method can perform stochastic and controllable reconstruction tasks even with small sample sizes. Additionally, it can generate large-size (e.g. 512 and 1024) 3D microstructures using a chunking strategy. By introducing spatial location masks, our method excels at generating spatially heterogeneous and complex microstructures. We conducted experiments on stochastic reconstruction, controllable reconstruction, heterogeneous reconstruction, and large-size microstructure reconstruction across various materials. Comparative analysis through visualization, statistical measures, and physical property simulations demonstrates the effectiveness, providing new insights and possibilities for research on structure-property linkage and material inverse design."

Motivated by this insight, we propose \\emph{Slot Transformer Imagination with CAusality-aware reinforcement learning} (STICA), a unified framework in which object-centric Transformers serve as the world model and causality-aware policy and value networks.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a \"Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason\" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths."

We first investigated mappings between tail movements and emotional expressions from robotics and zoology, and accordingly developed a motion-emotion mapping scheme. A physical robotic tail was implemented, and specific tail motions were designed based on our scheme. An online, video-based user study with 21 participants was conducted. Our findings suggest that, although the intended emotions conveyed by the tail were not consistently recognized, open-ended feedback indicated that the tail motion needs to align with the scenarios and cues. Our result highlights the necessity of scenario-specific optimization to enhance tail-based eHMIs. Future work will refine tail movement strategies to maximize their effectiveness across diverse interaction contexts."

Specifically, we construct a 2D placement model at the component level in which we include near-continuous rotation of components and allow for irregular subsystem geometries to make optimal use of the limited design space. Second, we introduce linearization techniques for the trigonometric constraints and formulate the placement problem as a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP). Finally, we demonstrate our framework on two electric motorcycle powertrain topologies and study the influence of the geometry complexity on the placement solutions. The results show that gradually increasing complexity leads to more manageable computation times and higher the complexity solution improves handling performance by 2.5% compared to the benchmark placement found in existing electric motorcycles."

This paper presents KTester, a novel framework that integrates project-specific knowledge and testing domain knowledge to enhance LLM-based test generation. Our approach first extracts project structure and usage knowledge through static analysis, which provides rich context for the model. It then employs a testing-domain-knowledge-guided separation of test case design and test method generation, combined with a multi-perspective prompting strategy that guides the LLM to consider diverse testing heuristics. The generated tests follow structured templates, improving clarity and maintainability. We evaluate KTester on multiple open-source projects, comparing it against state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines using automatic correctness and coverage metrics, as well as a human study assessing readability and maintainability. Results demonstrate that KTester significantly outperforms existing methods across six key metrics, improving execution pass rate by 5.69% and line coverage by 8.83% over the strongest baseline, while requiring less time and generating fewer test cases. Human evaluators also rate the tests produced by KTester significantly higher in terms of correctness, readability, and maintainability, confirming the practical advantages of our knowledge-driven framework."

The presence of AGN in their central galaxies is identified using multi-wavelength catalogs, including the X-ray counterparts, the ASKAP radio catalog, and the DESI spectroscopic measurements. We apply the stacking method to obtain sufficient statistics for the X-ray surface brightness profile and the $L_X$ for groups with different central AGN properties. We find that the X-ray groups exhibit the highest $L_X$, followed by groups with QSO, radio, BPT-AGN, and non-AGN centrals. Moreover, the $L_X$ of the $M_h \\lesssim 10^{13}h^{-1}M_\\odot$ groups is dominated by the central AGN, while the X-ray emission from extended gas tends to be more prominent in the $M_h \\gtrsim 10^{13}h^{-1}M_\\odot$ groups. In groups where the AGN play a major role in X-ray emission, the contribution from extended gas is minor, resulting in significant uncertainties concerning the extended X-ray emission. When the subset containing the X-ray detected counterparts is excluded, the extended gas component becomes easier to obtain. A correlation has been identified between the X-ray luminosity of the central AGN and extended gas. However, once we account for the positional offset, their correlation becomes less prominent. Currently, the results are not conclusive enough to confirm whether there is a connection between the AGN feedback and extended gas. However, they provide a new perspective on the feedback processes in the history of group assembly."

This study presents an empirically validated Scrum-based Agile framework tailored for DO-178C compliant, safety-critical aerospace software. The framework adapts core Scrum roles, artifacts, and events to meet certification, verification, and independence objectives. Key enhancements include a multi-disciplinary product ownership model, dual compliance-and-functionality acceptance criteria, independent testing and documentation teams, and dedicated certification liaisons. The approach was evaluated through two comparable aerospace projects-one using the customized Agile process and the other a traditional Waterfall model. Results showed significant improvements: a 76% reduction in Total Effort per Requirement, 75% faster Defect Detection, 78% faster Defect Resolution, and over 50% lower Defect Density, while maintaining full compliance with DO-178C Design Assurance Level A. These findings demonstrate that Agile practices and regulatory compliance can coexist effectively when supported by disciplined tailoring and proactive engagement with certification authorities. The study also notes challenges, including increased V&V effort due to recurring Sprint activities and refactoring inherent to iterative development. Nonetheless, it identifies substantial opportunities for further gains through workflow automation, CI/CD practices, and automated documentation, verification, and configuration management. Future research should expand validation of this framework across the aerospace domain and other safety-critical industries with similar certification requirements."

Traditional centralized machine learning struggles with the distributed data and privacy concerns in these heterogeneous environments, while existing federated learning approaches suffer from high costs and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose HFL-FlowLLM, which to our knowledge is the first framework to apply large language models to network traffic flow classification in heterogeneous federated learning. Compared to state-of-the-art heterogeneous federated learning methods for network traffic flow classification, the proposed approach improves the average F1 score by approximately 13%, demonstrating compelling performance and strong robustness. When compared to existing large language models federated learning frameworks, as the number of clients participating in each training round increases, the proposed method achieves up to a 5% improvement in average F1 score while reducing the training costs by about 87%. These findings prove the potential and practical value of HFL-FlowLLM in modern communication networks security."

To address this, we propose N-GLARE (A Non-Generative, Latent Representation-Efficient LLM Safety Evaluator). N-GLARE operates entirely on the model's latent representations, bypassing the need for full text generation. It characterizes hidden layer dynamics by analyzing the APT (Angular-Probabilistic Trajectory) of latent representations and introducing the JSS (Jensen-Shannon Separability) metric. Experiments on over 40 models and 20 red teaming strategies demonstrate that the JSS metric exhibits high consistency with the safety rankings derived from Red Teaming. N-GLARE reproduces the discriminative trends of large-scale red-teaming tests at less than 1\\% of the token cost and the runtime cost, providing an efficient output-free evaluation proxy for real-time diagnostics."

    "abstract": "Existing state-of-the-art image tokenization methods leverage diverse semantic features from pre-trained vision models for additional supervision, to expand the distribution of latent representations and thereby improve the quality of image reconstruction and generation. These methods employ a locally supervised approach for semantic supervision, which limits the uniformity of semantic distribution. However, VA-VAE proves that a more uniform feature distribution yields better generation performance. In this work, we introduce a Global Perspective Tokenizer (GloTok), which utilizes global relational information to model a more uniform semantic distribution of tokenized features. Specifically, a codebook-wise histogram relation learning method is proposed to transfer the semantics, which are modeled by pre-trained models on the entire dataset, to the semantic codebook. Then, we design a residual learning module that recovers the fine-grained details to minimize the reconstruction error caused by quantization. Through the above design, GloTok delivers more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations, which facilitates the training of autoregressive (AR) models for generating high-quality images without requiring direct access to pre-trained models during the training process. Experiments on the standard ImageNet-1k benchmark clearly show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and generation quality."

Using Mawhin's coincidence degree, we establish collision-free periodic solutions under a simple nonresonance condition.

This provides a topological route to choreographies beyond variational and numerical frameworks."

To alleviate the issue of lacking high-quality data for model alignment, some works on weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) finetune a strong pretrained model with a weak supervisor so that it can generalize beyond weak supervision. However, the invariable use of weak supervision in existing methods exposes issues in robustness, with a proportion of weak labels proving harmful to models. In this paper, we propose a selective W2SG framework to avoid using weak supervision when unnecessary. We train a binary classifier P(IK) to identify questions that a strong model can answer and use its self-generated labels for alignment. We further refine weak labels with a graph smoothing method. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms competitive baselines. Further analyses show that P(IK) can generalize across tasks and difficulties, which indicates selective W2SG can help superalignment."

Fast radio bursts (FRBs), with their cosmological distances and precisely measured dispersion, offer an excellent laboratory for testing this hypothesis. In this work, we propose an improved distribution function for the dispersion measure arising from extragalactic gas and demonstrate that it provides an excellent fit to mock data. We then apply this distribution to constrain the photon rest mass under the $Λ$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM cosmological models, the last of which is favored by recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation observations. The corresponding 1$σ$ upper limits on the photon mass are found to be $4.83\\times10^{-51}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, $4.71\\times10^{-51}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, and $4.86\\times10^{-51}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, respectively, which are the most stringent constraints derived from FRBs to date.

It leverages voxelized LiDAR data as a lightweight and structured perceptual representation, and employs a z-grouped 2D CNN to map this representation to the control policy, enabling fully end-to-end optimization. A high-fidelity LiDAR simulation that dynamically generates realistic observations is developed to support scalable, LiDAR-based training and ensure sim-to-real consistency. Experimental results show that Gallant's broader perceptual coverage facilitates the use of a single policy that goes beyond the limitations of previous methods confined to ground-level obstacles, extending to lateral clutter, overhead constraints, multi-level structures, and narrow passages. Gallant also firstly achieves near 100% success rates in challenging scenarios such as stair climbing and stepping onto elevated platforms through improved end-to-end optimization."

Here, we report the observation of critical scaling in a two-dimensional quantum gas of essentially noninteracting photons, which thermalize by radiative contact to a reservoir of molecules inside a microcavity.

These accelerated electrons are responsible for energy transport and subsequent emissions in HXR, radio, and UV/EUV radiation. Due to the steeply decreasing electron spectrum, the electron population and consequently the overall flare energetics, are predominantly influenced by low-energy non-thermal electrons. However, deducing the electron distribution in this energy-containing range remains a significant challenge. In this study, we apply the warm-target HXR emission model with kappa-form injected electrons to two well-observed GOES M-class flares. Moreover, we utilize EUV observations to constrain the flaring plasma properties, which enables us to determine the characteristics of accelerated electrons across a range from a few keV to tens of keV. We demonstrate that the warm-target model reliably constrains the properties of flare-associated electrons, even accounting for the uncertainties that had previously been unaddressed. The application of a kappa distribution for the accelerated electrons allows for meaningful comparisons with electron distributions inferred from EUV observations, specifically for energy ranges below the detection threshold of RHESSI. Our results indicate that the accelerated electrons constitute only a small fraction of the total electron population within the flaring region. Moreover, the physical parameters, such as electron escape time and acceleration time scale, inferred from both the warm-target model and the EUV observations further support the scenario in which electrons undergo thermalization within the corona. This study highlights the effectiveness of integrating the warm-target model with EUV observations to accurately characterize energy-containing electrons and their associated acceleration and transport processes."

In this work, we analyze MBH mergers, their GW signals and detectability, as well as their population properties, using the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation - NINJA Simulation Suite. We discuss the effect of resolution and finite volume on the black hole mass function (BHMF), which in turn limits the mergers associated with low mass black holes, $M_{BH} \\lesssim 10^{6.5} M_\\odot$. We find the upper limit on the total mass of the MBH binaries detectable by LISA to be $\\sim 10^{8.4} M_\\odot$. We also find that adding time delays pertaining to dissipative processes like dynamical friction and stellar hardening during the final stages of the inspiral for which the simulation lacks sufficient resolution to model, considerably shifts the peak of redshift distribution of detectable binaries from $z\\sim0.5$ to $z\\sim0.1$. Time delays reduce the number of detectable GW events but on the other hand their signal-to-noise is increased. From the observational point of view, we find a strong correlation between the SFR and $L_{\\rm bol}$ at high redshifts for the detectable LISA binaries. This may prove to be a future application in the coincident observation of MBH binaries by GW and electromagnetic observations."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown a remarkable ability to generalize beyond their pre-training data, and fine-tuning LLMs can elevate performance to human-level and beyond. However, in real-world scenarios, lacking labeled data often prevents practitioners from obtaining well-performing models, thereby forcing practitioners to highly rely on prompt-based approaches that are often tedious, inefficient, and driven by trial and error. To alleviate this issue of lacking labeled data, we present a learning framework integrating LLMs with active learning for unlabeled dataset (LAUD). LAUD mitigates the cold-start problem by constructing an initial label set with zero-shot learning. Experimental results show that LLMs derived from LAUD outperform LLMs with zero-shot or few-shot learning on commodity name classification tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of LAUD."

    "abstract": "Adaptive optimizers with decoupled weight decay, such as AdamW, are the de facto standard for pre-training large transformer-based generative models. Yet the quadratic nature of the $\\ell_2$ penalty embedded in weight decay drives all parameters toward the origin at the same rate, making the update vulnerable to rare but extreme gradient directions and often over-penalizing well-conditioned coordinates. We propose AdamHuberDecay, a drop-in replacement for AdamW that substitutes the $\\ell_2$ penalty with a decoupled smooth Huber regularizer. The resulting update decays parameters quadratically while their magnitude remains below a threshold $δ$, and linearly ($\\ell_1$-like) once they exceed $δ$, yielding (i) bounded regularization gradients, (ii) invariance to per-coordinate second-moment rescaling, and (iii) stronger sparsity pressure on overgrown weights. We derive the closed-form decoupled Huber decay step and show how to integrate it with any Adam-family optimizer at $O(1)$ extra cost. Extensive experiments on GPT-2 and GPT-3 pre-training demonstrate that AdamHuberDecay (a) converges 10-15% faster in wall-clock time, (b) reduces validation perplexity by up to 4 points, (c) delivers performance improvements of 2.5-4.7% across downstream tasks, and (d) yields visibly sparser weight histograms that translate into 20-30% memory savings after magnitude pruning, without tuning the decay coefficient beyond the default grid used for AdamW. Ablations confirm robustness to outlier gradients and large-batch regimes, together with theoretical analyses that bound the expected parameter norm under noisy updates. AdamHuberDecay therefore provides a simple, principled path toward more efficient and resilient training of next-generation foundational generative transformers."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deployments. We propose FLARE, an adaptive reputation-based framework that transforms client reliability assessment from binary decisions to a continuous, multi-dimensional trust evaluation. FLARE integrates: (i) a multi-dimensional reputation score capturing performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior, (ii) a self-calibrating adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts security strictness based on model convergence and recent attack intensity, (iii) reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than eliminating clients outright, and (iv) a Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism enabling reputation scoring on privatized client updates. We further introduce a highly evasive Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack, a benchmark adversary that blends honest gradients with synthetic perturbations and persistent drift to remain undetected by traditional filters. Extensive experiments with 100 clients on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that FLARE maintains high model accuracy and converges faster than state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust methods under diverse attack types, including label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM. FLARE improves robustness by up to 16% and preserves model convergence within 30% of the non-attacked baseline, while achieving strong malicious-client detection performance with minimal computational overhead. https://github.com/Anonymous0-0paper/FLARE"

To address this challenge, we leverage the penalty gradient approach recently developed for bilevel optimization which formulates bilevel optimization as a Lagrangian problem. This leads to a novel fully first-order algorithm, termed \\texttt{F$^2$BMLD}. Apart from the convergence bound, we further provide a generalization bound, revealing an inherent trade-off in the choice of the Lagrange multiplier between optimization and statistical guarantees. Finally, we empirically validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on an offline reinforcement learning benchmark."

    "abstract": "Seismic sensing has emerged as a promising solution for border surveillance and monitoring; the seismic sensors that are often buried underground are small and cannot be noticed easily, making them difficult for intruders to detect, avoid, or vandalize. This significantly enhances their effectiveness compared to highly visible cameras or fences. However, accurately detecting and distinguishing between overlapping activities that are happening simultaneously, such as human intrusions, animal movements, and vehicle rumbling, remains a major challenge due to the complex and noisy nature of seismic signals. Correctly identifying simultaneous activities is critical because failing to separate them can lead to misclassification, missed detections, and an incomplete understanding of the situation, thereby reducing the reliability of surveillance systems. To tackle this problem, we propose HyMAD (Hybrid Multi-Activity Detection), a deep neural architecture based on spatio-temporal feature fusion. The framework integrates spectral features extracted with SincNet and temporal dependencies modeled by a recurrent neural network (RNN). In addition, HyMAD employs self-attention layers to strengthen intra-modal representations and a cross-modal fusion module to achieve robust multi-label classification of seismic events. e evaluate our approach on a dataset constructed from real-world field recordings collected in the context of border surveillance and monitoring, demonstrating its ability to generalize to complex, simultaneous activity scenarios involving humans, animals, and vehicles. Our method achieves competitive performance and offers a modular framework for extending seismic-based activity recognition in real-world security applications."

    "abstract": "Two-phase sampling designs have been widely adopted in epidemiological studies to reduce costs when measuring certain biomarkers is prohibitively expensive. Under these designs, investigators commonly relate survival outcomes to risk factors using the Cox proportional hazards model. To fully utilize covariates collected in phase 1, multiple imputation methods have been developed to impute missing covariates for individuals not included in the phase 2 sample. However, performing multiple imputation on large-scale cohorts can be computationally intensive or even infeasible. To address this issue, Borgan et al. (2023) proposed a random supersampling (RSS) approach that randomly selects a subset of cohort members for imputation, albeit at the cost of reduced efficiency. In this study, we propose an influence function-based supersampling (ISS) approach with weight calibration. The method achieves efficiency comparable to imputing the entire cohort, even with a small supersample, while substantially reducing computational burden. We further demonstrate that the proposed method is particularly advantageous when estimating hazard ratios for high-dimensional expensive biomarkers. Extensive simulation studies are conducted, and a real data application using the National Institutes of Health-American Association of Retired Persons (NIH-AARP) Diet and Health Study is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

However, current medical screening methods often miss the early warning signs of smoking-related health problems, leading to late-stage diagnoses when treatment options become limited. This study presents a systematic comparative evaluation of machine learning approaches for smoking-related health risk assessment, emphasizing clinical interpretability and practical deployment over algorithmic innovation. We analyzed health screening data from 55,691 individuals, examining various health indicators, including body measurements, blood tests, and demographic information. We tested three advanced prediction algorithms - Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM - to determine which could most accurately identify people at high risk. This study employed a cross-sectional design to classify current smoking status based on health screening biomarkers, not to predict future disease development. Our Random Forest model performed best, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.926, meaning it could reliably distinguish between high-risk and lower-risk individuals. Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to understand what the model was detecting, we found that key health markers played crucial roles in prediction: blood pressure levels, triglyceride concentrations, liver enzyme readings, and kidney function indicators (serum creatinine) were the strongest signals of declining health in smokers."

We show that this observable has logarithmic structures never seen before in QCD calculations. Notably, its description involves the resummation of non-global and coherence-violating logarithmic contributions that are more singular than any reported to date. We analyze its all-orders behavior, providing analytical resummations at next-to-double-logarithmic accuracy for $e^+e^-$ and $pp$ collisions, and numerical resummations at leading-logarithmic accuracy in the Veneziano limit for $pp$ collisions. We further present a computation of the leading coherence-violating correction for $pp$ collisions. The intricate structure of vetoes in azimuthal gaps reveals new aspects of QCD dynamics and offers a novel probe of collinear-factorization breaking at the LHC."

Effective prompts should meet three principles: focus on decision-critical information, provide step-level granularity, and minimize reliance on expert annotations through label efficiency. However, existing ICL methods often fail to satisfy all three criteria simultaneously. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce SkillGen, a skill-based ICL framework for structured sequential reasoning. It constructs an action-centric, domain-level graph from sampled trajectories, identifies high-utility actions via temporal-difference credit assignment, and retrieves step-wise skills to generate fine-grained, context-aware prompts. We further present a theoretical analysis showing that focusing on high-utility segments supports task identifiability and informs more effective ICL prompt design. Experiments on ALFWorld, BabyAI, and ScienceWorld, using both open-source and proprietary LLMs, show that SkillGen achieves consistent gains, improving progress rate by 5.9%-16.5% on average across models."

We assume that the spatiotemporal panel is drawn from a univariate random process and that the data follows a spatiotemporal autoregressive process which includes a regressive term with space-/ time-varying exogenous regressor, a temporal autoregressive term and a spatial autoregressive term with an unknown weights matrix. The aim is to estimate this weight matrix alongside other parameters using a constraint penalised maximum likelihood estimator. Monte Carlo simulations showed a good performance with the accuracy increasing with an increasing number of time points. The use of the LASSO technique also consistently distinguishes between meaningful relationships (non-zeros) from those that are not (existing zeros) in both the spatial weights and other parameters. This regularised estimation procedure is applied to hourly particulate matter concentrations (PM10) in the Bavaria region, Germany for the years 2005 to 2020. Results show some stations with a high spatial dependency, resulting in a greater influence of PM10 concentrations in neighbouring monitoring stations. The LASSO technique proved to produce a sparse weights matrix by shrinking some weights to zero, hence improving the interpretability of the PM concentration dependencies across measurement stations in Bavaria"

A fixed-point analysis of the background cosmology reveals a stable de Sitter attractor, ensuring the model naturally drives accelerated expansion. Crucially, we investigate the cosmological perturbations and show that the theory's six propagating degrees of freedom are free from ghost instabilities. We further demonstrate that all large-scale tensor modes are dynamically stable and decay on the accelerating background. This ghost-free massive gravity extension provides distinct predictions for gravitational wave polarizations and is theoretically consistent with $\\mathbf{ΛCDM}$ at late times, positioning it as a unique alternative to scalar-tensor models like $f(R)$ and Galileons. This robust stability at both the background and perturbative levels establishes our model as a consistent and compelling alternative to the standard $Λ$CDM paradigm."

We studied bias-specific benchmarks such as StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in multiple generative models such as BERT and GPT 3.5. We proposed an automated Bias-Identification Framework to recognize various social biases in LLMs such as gender, race, profession, and religion. We adopted a two-pronged approach to detect explicit and implicit biases in text data. Results indicated fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excelled at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings illustrated that despite having some success, LLMs often over-relied on keywords. To illuminate the capability of the analyzed LLMs in detecting implicit biases, we employed Bag-of-Words analysis and unveiled indications of implicit stereotyping within the vocabulary. To bolster the model performance, we applied an enhancement strategy involving fine-tuning models using prompting techniques and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks.

However, traditional VLA models that generate actions through flow matching (FM) typically rely on rigid and uniform time schedules, i.e., synchronous FM (SFM). Without action context awareness and asynchronous self-correction, SFM becomes unstable in long-horizon tasks, where a single action error can cascade into failure. In this work, we propose asynchronous flow matching VLA (AsyncVLA), a novel framework that introduces temporal flexibility in asynchronous FM (AFM) and enables self-correction in action generation. AsyncVLA breaks from the vanilla SFM in VLA models by generating the action tokens in a non-uniform time schedule with action context awareness. Besides, our method introduces the confidence rater to extract confidence of the initially generated actions, enabling the model to selectively refine inaccurate action tokens before execution. Moreover, we propose a unified training procedure for SFM and AFM that endows a single model with both modes, improving KV-cache utilization. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that AsyncVLA is data-efficient and exhibits self-correction ability. AsyncVLA achieves state-of-the-art results across general embodied evaluations due to its asynchronous generation in AFM. Our code is available at https://github.com/YuhuaJiang2002/AsyncVLA."

However, the recent development of Transformer-based relation extraction (RE) methods has enabled us to generate KGs dynamically by giving them natural language texts, and thereby opened the possibility for representing the meaning of the input sentences with the created KGs. Using this effect, we propose a method that answers MCQs in the \"fill-in-the-blank\" format, taking care of the point that RE methods generate KGs that represent false information if provided with factually incorrect texts. We measure the truthfulness of each question sentence by (i) converting the sentence into a relational graph using an RE method and (ii) verifying it against factually correct KGs under the closed-world assumption. The experimental results demonstrate that our method correctly answers up to around 70% of the questions, while providing traceability of the procedure. We also highlight that the question category has a vast influence on the accuracy."

    "abstract": "Data centers host a variety of essential services such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Electric grid operators, however, have limited knowledge of the reliability risks of data center interconnection due to their unique operational characteristics. An emerging concern is the sub-synchronous resonance (SSR) which refer to unexpected voltage/current oscillations at typical frequencies below 60/50 Hz. It remains unknown whether and how the interactions between data centers and the grid may trigger resonances, equipment damages, and even cascading failures. In this paper, we focus on grid-connected data centers that draw electricity from the grid through power factor correction (PFC) converters. We conduct two-tone frequency sweep to investigate the data centers' impedance characteristics, i.e. magnitude and phase angle variations over frequencies, and showcase their deep dependence on compute workloads. The impedance modeling provides a direct approach to evaluating SSR risks and enable a cooperative mechanism to alarm and avoid resonance-prone situations. Building upon the impedance, a data-driven preventive controller is then established to raise early warnings of risky operation and suggest flexible workload management according to the given grid conditions. Through case study, we demonstrate how to use impedance to understand the unexpected interactions. Data-driven impedance is validated to show decent performance in capturing the unique impedance dips and tracking the impedance variations across a range of workload scenarios. The early warning and preventive control approaches are further effective to improve the safety margins with minimal workload rescheduling. The key findings of this work will provide valuable insights for grid operators and data center managers, and support preparation for future scenarios involving large-scale data center integration."

    "abstract": "Enforcing a fair workload allocation among multiple agents tasked to achieve an objective in learning enabled demand side healthcare worker settings is crucial for consistent and reliable performance at runtime. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches steer fairness by shaping reward through post hoc orchestrations, leaving no certifiable self-enforceable fairness that is immutable by individual agents at runtime. Contextualized within a setting where each agent shares resources with others, we address this shortcoming with a learning enabled optimization scheme among self-interested decision makers whose individual actions affect those of other agents. This extends the problem to a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game-theoretic framework where we steer group policy to a safe and locally efficient equilibrium, so that no agent can improve its utility function by unilaterally changing its decisions. Fair-GNE models MARL as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium-seeking (GNE) game, prescribing an ideal equitable collective equilibrium within the problem's natural fabric. Our hypothesis is rigorously evaluated in our custom-designed high-fidelity resuscitation simulator. Across all our numerical experiments, Fair-GNE achieves significant improvement in workload balance over fixed-penalty baselines (0.89 vs.\\ 0.33 JFI, $p < 0.01$) while maintaining 86\\% task success, demonstrating statistically significant fairness gains through adaptive constraint enforcement. Our results communicate our formulations, evaluation metrics, and equilibrium-seeking innovations in large multi-agent learning-based healthcare systems with clarity and principled fairness enforcement."

    "abstract": "We investigate how the spectral and topological properties of electron systems evolve on a lattice that interpolates between the honeycomb and its 1/6-depleted structures through the introduction of selective random defects. We find that in certain parameter regimes, the topological properties of the two lattice systems are smoothly connected, whereas in other regimes, selective random defects induce a topological transition. Analysis based on an effective model reveals that the effect of selective random defects can be understood as a modulation of hopping amplitudes. Our results highlight the potential for designing and controlling the spectral and even topological properties of electronic systems across a wide range of material platforms."

    "abstract": "Estimating causal effects on time-to-event outcomes from observational data is particularly challenging due to censoring, limited sample sizes, and non-random treatment assignment. The need for answering such \"when-if\" questions--how the timing of an event would change under a specified intervention--commonly arises in real-world settings with heterogeneous treatment adoption and confounding. To address these challenges, we propose Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) to estimate counterfactual hazard trajectories in a panel data setting where multiple units experience potentially different treatments over multiple periods. In such a setting, SSC estimates the counterfactual hazard trajectory for a unit of interest as a weighted combination of the observed trajectories from other units. To provide formal justification, we introduce a panel framework with a low-rank structure for causal survival analysis. Indeed, such a structure naturally arises under classical parametric survival models. Within this framework, for the causal estimand of interest, we establish identification and finite sample guarantees for SSC. We validate our approach using a multi-country clinical dataset of cancer treatment outcomes, where the staggered introduction of new therapies creates a quasi-experimental setting. Empirically, we find that access to novel treatments is associated with improved survival, as reflected by lower post-intervention hazard trajectories relative to their synthetic counterparts. Given the broad relevance of survival analysis across medicine, economics, and public policy, our framework offers a general and interpretable tool for counterfactual survival inference using observational data."

Brute-force attacks, key compromise, and unauthorized access have become highly common cyber threats. This research presents a novel fuzzy logic-based cryptographic framework that dynamically generates encryption keys in real-time by accessing system-level entropy and hardware-bound trust. The proposed system leverages a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) to evaluate system parameters that include CPU utilization, process count, and timestamp variation. It assigns entropy level based on linguistically defined fuzzy rules which are fused with hardware-generated randomness and then securely sealed using a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). The sealed key is incorporated in an AES-GCM encryption scheme to ensure both confidentiality and integrity of the data. This system introduces a scalable solution for adaptive encryption in high-assurance computing, zero-trust environments, and cloud-based infrastructure."

    "abstract": "Neonates are highly susceptible to seizures, often leading to short or long-term neurological impairments. However, clinical manifestations of neonatal seizures are subtle and often lead to misdiagnoses. This increases the risk of prolonged, untreated seizure activity and subsequent brain injury. Continuous video electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring is the gold standard for seizure detection. However, this is an expensive evaluation that requires expertise and time. In this study, we propose a convolutional neural network-based model for early prediction of neonatal seizures by distinguishing between interictal and preictal states of the EEG. Our model is patient-independent, enabling generalization across multiple subjects, and utilizes mel-frequency cepstral coefficient matrices extracted from multichannel EEG and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals as input features. Trained and validated on the Helsinki neonatal EEG dataset with 10-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an average accuracy of 97.52%, sensitivity of 98.31%, specificity of 96.39%, and F1-score of 97.95%, enabling accurate seizure prediction up to 30 minutes before onset. The inclusion of ECG alongside EEG improved the F1-score by 1.42%, while the incorporation of an attention mechanism yielded an additional 0.5% improvement. To enhance transparency, we incorporated SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) as an explainable artificial intelligence method to interpret the model and provided localization of seizure focus using scalp plots. The overall results demonstrate the model's potential for minimally supervised deployment in neonatal intensive care units, enabling timely and reliable prediction of neonatal seizures, while demonstrating strong generalization capability across unseen subjects through transfer learning."

This problem is interesting because LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence to answer a question is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in a network of interacting LLMs. The hallucination spreads, causing previously accurate LLMs to hallucinate. We study interacting LLMs and their hallucination by combining novel ideas of mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and the randomized utility model from economics to construct a useful generative model. We model the LLM with a latent state that indicates if it is truthful or not with respect to the ground truth, and extend a tractable analytical model considering an MFD to model the diffusion of information in a directed network of LLMs. To specify the probabilities that govern the dynamics of the MFD, we propose a randomized utility model. For a network of LLMs, where each LLM has two possible latent states, we posit sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and analyze the behavior of the fixed point in terms of the incentive (e.g., test-time compute) given to individual LLMs. We experimentally study and analyze the behavior of a network of $100$ open-source LLMs with respect to data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and sensitivity to framing on multiple semi-synthetic datasets."

    "abstract": "Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis but are fundamentally constrained by the requirement for large-scale, meticulously annotated datasets. This dependency on \"big data\" is a critical bottleneck in the medical domain, where patient data is inherently difficult to acquire and expert annotation is expensive, particularly for rare diseases where samples are scarce by definition. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel paradigm: Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS). Instead of adapting a pre-existing model or training a new one, our approach leverages a large-scale, pre-trained generative engine to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier. Our framework, the Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS), takes as input minimal, multi-modal task information as little as a single example image (1-shot) and a corresponding clinical text description to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier. The generative engine interprets these inputs to generate the weights for a lightweight, efficient classifier (e.g., an EfficientNet-V2), which can be deployed for inference immediately without any task-specific training or fine-tuning. We conduct extensive evaluations on challenging few-shot classification benchmarks derived from the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset and a custom rare disease dataset. Our results demonstrate that SGPS establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming advanced few-shot and zero-shot learning methods, especially in the ultra-low data regimes of 1-shot and 5-shot classification. This work paves the way for the rapid development and deployment of AI-powered diagnostic tools, particularly for the long tail of rare diseases where data is critically limited."

It reduces to the Schwarzschild metric when gamma = 1. In this paper we explore potential signatures of the gamma-metric on periodic orbits and their gravitational-wave radiation. Periodic orbits are classified by a rotational number specified by three topological numbers (z, w, v), each triple corresponding to characteristic zoom-whirl behavior. We show that deviations from gamma=1 alter the radii and angular momentum of bound orbits and thereby shift the (z, w, v) taxonomy. We also compute representative gravitational waveforms for certain periodic orbits and demonstrate that gamma != 1 can induce phase shifts and amplitude modulations correlated with changes in the zoom-whirl structure. In particular, larger zoom numbers lead to increasingly complex substructures in the waveforms, and finite deviations from gamma=1 can significantly modify these features. Our results indicate that precise measurements of waveform morphology from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals may constrain deviations from spherical symmetry encoded in gamma."

    "abstract": "To promote the practicality of deep learning-based localization, existing studies aim to address the issue of scenario dependence through meta-learning. However, these studies primarily focus on variations in environmental layouts while overlooking the impact of changes in device configurations, such as bandwidth, the number of access points (APs), and the number of antennas used. Unlike environmental changes, variations in device configurations affect the dimensionality of channel state information (CSI), thereby compromising neural network usability. To address this issue, we propose Meta-SimGNN, a novel WiFi localization system that integrates graph neural networks with meta-learning to improve localization generalization and robustness. First, we introduce a fine-grained CSI graph construction scheme, where each AP is treated as a graph node, allowing for adaptability to changes in the number of APs. To structure the features of each node, we propose an amplitude-phase fusion method and a feature extraction method. The former utilizes both amplitude and phase to construct CSI images, enhancing data reliability, while the latter extracts dimension-consistent features to address variations in bandwidth and the number of antennas. Second, a similarity-guided meta-learning strategy is developed to enhance adaptability in diverse scenarios. The initial model parameters for the fine-tuning stage are determined by comparing the similarity between the new scenario and historical scenarios, facilitating rapid adaptation of the model to the new localization scenario. Extensive experimental results over commodity WiFi devices in different scenarios show that Meta-SimGNN outperforms the baseline methods in terms of localization generalization and accuracy."

Existing token compression methods, while varied, often lack a high-level semantic understanding, leading to suboptimal merges, information redundancy, or context loss. To address these limitations, we introduce CORE (Compact Object-centric REpresentations), a new paradigm for visual token compression. CORE leverages an efficient segmentation decoder to generate object masks, which serve as a high-level semantic prior to guide the merging of visual tokens into a compact set of object-centric representations. Furthermore, a novel centroid-guided sorting mechanism restores a coherent spatial order to the merged tokens, preserving vital positional information. Extensive experiments show that CORE not only establishes a new state-of-the-art on six authoritative benchmarks for fixed-rate compression, but also achieves dramatic efficiency gains in adaptive-rate settings. Even under extreme compression, after aggressively retaining with only 2.2% of all visual tokens, CORE still maintains 97.4% of baseline performance. Our work demonstrates the superiority of object-centric representations for efficient and effective LVLM processing."

By incorporating red blood cell radial fluctuations with uncertainty-driven loss, SR-fUS achieves 25-μm spatial and 10-ms temporal resolution. SR-fUS was applied to image transient hemodynamic responses induced by pain stimulation in rat brains. SR-fUS accuracy in cortical microvasculature during whisker stimulation was further validated by a comparative study with two-photon microscopy."

Unlike other multipath components, these first-order paths carry structural information that can be exploited as additional prior knowledge for target direction estimation. To exploit this property, we construct a sparse representation of the multi-target sensing channel and propose a novel cross sparsity structure under a three-layer hierarchical structured (3LHS) prior model, which leverages the first-order paths to enhance the prior probability of the direct paths and thereby improve the estimation accuracy. Building on this model, we propose a structured fast turbo variational Bayesian inference (SF-TVBI) algorithm, which integrates an efficient message-passing strategy to enable tractable probabilistic exchange within the cross sparsity, and a two-timescale update scheme to reduce the update frequency of the high-dimensional sparse vector. Simulation results demonstrate that leveraging the proposed cross sparsity structure is able to improve the target angle estimation accuracy substantially, and the SF-TVBI algorithm achieves estimation performance comparable to that of the Turbo-VBI, but with lower computational complexity."

This results in the destruction of the donor via either the triple- or quadruple-detonation mechanism, adding significant mass to the resulting ejecta as well as modifying its structure and composition. We simulate the evolution of supernova remnants resulting from such detonations in a variety of binary progenitors and compare them against a double detonation with a surviving donor. Because of the time delay between the detonations of the two white dwarfs, high-velocity ejecta from the first explosion governs the first few centuries of remnant evolution, whereas at later times the dense core resulting from the donor detonation drives both the forward and reverse shocks to larger radii. The collision between the highest-velocity ejecta of the primary explosion and the donor carves a conical wake into the ejecta, which persists into the remnant phase regardless of whether or not the donor detonates. Our suite of simulated remnants are found to exhibit multiple distinguishing features of the explosion properties: a distinct X-ray morphology in the thermal emission and iron lines for triple detonations and smaller remnants with centrally-concentrated emission for double detonations. The remnants are also varied in their elemental abundances and distributions, particularly for lighter elements, but these have limited observational utility and are sensitive to the properties of the progenitor binary."

Traditional navigation approaches rely on static Building Information Modeling (BIM) priors or limited onboard perception. In contrast, our framework continuously fuses real-time LiDAR data from aerial and ground robots with BIM priors to maintain an evolving 2D occupancy map. We quantify navigation safety through a unified corridor-risk metric integrating occupancy uncertainty, BIM-map discrepancy, and clearance. When risk exceeds safety thresholds, the UAV autonomously re-scans affected regions to reduce uncertainty and enable safe replanning. Validation in PX4-Gazebo simulation with Robotec GPU LiDAR demonstrates that risk-triggered re-scanning reduces mean corridor risk by 58% and map entropy by 43% compared to static BIM navigation, while maintaining clearance margins above 0.4 m. Compared to frontier-based exploration, our approach achieves similar uncertainty reduction in half the mission time. These results demonstrate that integrating BIM priors with risk-adaptive aerial sensing enables scalable, uncertainty-aware autonomy for construction robotics."

Also, in conventional AL, annotation effort is a function of the ROI- larger regions make the task cognitively easier but incur higher annotation costs, whereas smaller regions demand finer precision and more attention from the expert. In this context, language guidance provides an effective alternative, requiring minimal expert effort while bypassing the cognitively demanding task of precise boundary delineation in segmentation. Towards this goal, we introduce LINGUAL: a framework that receives natural language instructions from an expert, translates them into executable programs through in-context learning, and automatically performs the corresponding sequence of sub-tasks without any human intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LINGUAL in active domain adaptation (ADA) achieving comparable or superior performance to AL baselines while reducing estimated annotation time by approximately 80%."

    "abstract": "Humans can easily identify anatomical planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal) on a 2D MRI slice, but automated systems struggle with this task. Missing plane orientation metadata can complicate analysis, increase domain shift when merging heterogeneous datasets, and reduce accuracy of diagnostic classifiers. This study develops a classifier that accurately generates plane orientation metadata. We adopt a 2.5D context-aware model that leverages multi-slice information to avoid ambiguity from isolated slices and enable robust feature learning. We train the 2.5D model on both 3D slice sequences and static 2D images. While our 2D reference model achieves 98.74% accuracy, our 2.5D method raises this to 99.49%, reducing errors by 60%, highlighting the importance of 2.5D context. We validate the utility of our generated metadata in a brain tumor detection task. A gated strategy selectively uses metadata-enhanced predictions based on uncertainty scores, boosting accuracy from 97.0% with an image-only model to 98.0%, reducing misdiagnoses by 33.3%. We integrate our plane orientation model into an interactive web application and provide it open-source."

    "abstract": "The static nature of knowledge within Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it difficult for them to adapt to evolving information, rendering knowledge editing a critical task. However, existing methods struggle with challenges of scalability and retrieval efficiency, particularly when handling complex, multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ALEX (A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor), a lightweight knowledge editing framework. The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C). Furthermore, the framework integrates an Inferential Query Synthesis (IQS) module to bridge the semantic gap between queries and facts , and a Dynamic Evidence Adjudication (DEA) engine that executes an efficient two-stage retrieval process. Experiments on the MQUAKE benchmark demonstrate that ALEX significantly improves both the accuracy of multi-hop answers (MultiHop-ACC) and the reliability of reasoning paths (HopWise-ACC). It also reduces the required search space by over 80% , presenting a promising path toward building scalable, efficient, and accurate knowledge editing systems."

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that fine-tuning on insecure code data can trigger an emergent misalignment (EMA) phenomenon, where models generate malicious responses even to prompts unrelated to the original insecure code-writing task. Such cross-domain generalization of harmful behavior underscores the need for a deeper understanding of the algorithms, tasks, and datasets that induce emergent misalignment. In this work, we extend this study by demonstrating that emergent misalignment can also arise from narrow refusal unlearning in specific domains. We perform refusal unlearning on Cybersecurity and Safety concept, and evaluate EMA by monitoring refusal scores across seven responsible AI (RAI) domains, Cybersecurity, Safety, Toxicity, Bias, Sensitive Content, Medical/Legal, and Privacy. Our work shows that narrow domain unlearning can yield compliance responses for the targeted concept, however, it may also propagate EMA to unrelated domains. Among the two intervened concepts, Cybersecurity and Safety, we find that the safety concept can have larger EMA impact, i.e, causing lower refusal scores, across other unrelated domains such as bias. We observe this effect consistently across two model families, Mistral-7b-0.3v, and Qwen-7b-2.5. Further, we show that refusal unlearning augmented with cross-entropy loss function on a small set of retain data from the affected domains can largely, if not fully, restore alignment across the impacted domains while having lower refusal rate on the concept we perform unlearning on. To investigate the underlying causes of EMA, we analyze concept entanglements at the representation level via concept vectors. Our analysis reveals that concepts with higher representation similarity in earlier layers are more susceptible to EMA after intervention when the refusal stream is altered through targeted refusal unlearning."

We refine earlier calculations and analyze allowed transitions from hybrids to conventional quarkonia, including both spin-conserved and spin-flip decays. We carry out a comprehensive error analysis and discuss the reliability of our results.

    "abstract": "Developing efficient solvers for large-scale multi-term linear matrix equations remains a central challenge in numerical linear algebra and is still largely unresolved. This paper introduces a methodology leveraging CUR decomposition for solving large-scale generalized Sylvester as well as non-Sylvester multi-term equations on low-rank matrix manifolds. The approach decomposes the original equation into two smaller subproblems: one involving all columns with a small subset of rows, and the other involving all rows with a small subset of columns. The rows and columns are strategically selected using the discrete empirical interpolation method. We further utilize the CUR properties and propose a novel iterative scheme that removes the dependencies between selected and unselected rows (and likewise for columns), thereby enabling the subset problems to be solved independently. We present a Krylov-based scheme for solving the resulting subproblems, which scales effectively to large problems and does not rely on a Sylvester structure. The method incorporates rank adaptivity, dynamically adjusting computational rank to reach the desired accuracy. The methodology is demonstrated in three representative settings: (i) implicit time integration of matrix differential equations on low-rank manifolds, leading to multi-term linear matrix equations; (ii) large-scale steady-state generalized Lyapunov equations including cases of size up to $10^{13}$ unknown entries; and (iii) non-Sylvester linear matrix equations with Hadamard product terms, such as those arising in nonlinear partial differential equations."

Identifying where rule-based practical rationality ends is the beginning of making it aware until action. Although the rules of AI behaviors are still hidden or only weakly observable, the paper has proposed a methodology to make a sense of discrimination possible and practical to identify the distinctions of the behavior of AI models with three types of decisions.

    "abstract": "Delayed radio emission has been associated with a growing proportion of tidal disruption events (TDEs). For many events, the radio synchrotron emission is inferred to originate from the interaction of mildly-relativistic outflows, launched with delay times of $\\sim 100$--$1000$ d after the TDE optical peak. The mechanism behind these outflows remains uncertain, but may relate to instabilities or state transitions in the accretion disk formed from the TDE. We model the radio emission powered by the collision of mass outflows (\"flares\") from TDE accretion disks, considering scenarios in which two successive disk flares collide with each other, as well as collisions between the outflow and the circumnuclear medium (CNM). For flare masses of $\\sim 0.01$-$0.1 M_{\\odot}$, varied CNM densities, and different time intervals between ejected flares, we demonstrate that the shocks formed by the collisions have velocities $0.05c$-$0.3c$ at $\\sim 10^{17}$ cm and power bright radio emission of $L_ν \\sim 10^{27}$-$10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$, consistent with the properties inferred for observed events. We quantify how the typical peak timescale and flux varies for different properties of our models, and compare our model predictions to a selection of TDEs with delayed radio emission. Our models successfully reproduce the light curves and SEDs for several events, supporting the idea that delayed outflows from disk instabilities and state transitions can power late-time radio emission in TDEs."

A fundamental open question is whether these powerful tools can illuminate other areas of complex systems, such as social phenomena, where energy plays no fundamental role. Here we develop a framework that derives a ``second law\" for social systems. Similarly to Landauer's principle, it constrains spontaneous changes in agent attributes (opinions, cultural traits, etc.) and their informational entropy. We apply this framework to toy agent-based models of social imitation with non-trivial phase diagrams. We demonstrate how cornerstone results -- fluctuation theorems, kinetic and thermodynamic uncertainty relations, and second-law-like inequalities -- emerge naturally in this context, even across symmetry-breaking transitions. These results reveal fundamental trade-offs in opinion currents arising from the competition between herding and anti-conformity. Moreover, they provide inference tools to extract model parameters from observations of stochastic changes in agents."

However, inferring the network's graphical structure from data remains challenging. Bayesian structure learners approach this problem by inferring a posterior distribution over the possible directed acyclic graphs underlying the BN. The inference process often requires marginalizing over probability distributions, which is typically done using dynamic programming methods that restrict the set of possible parents for each node. Instead, we present a novel method that utilizes tractable probabilistic circuits to circumvent this restriction. This method utilizes a new learning routine that trains these circuits on both the original distribution and marginal queries. The architecture of probabilistic circuits then inherently allows for fast and exact marginalization on the learned distribution. We then show empirically that utilizing our method to answer marginals allows Bayesian structure learners to improve their performance compared to current methods."

Our analysis reveals a high electron temperature ($T_e$$\\sim$30000K) in the ionized gas, independent of the ionization level. We measure a wide range in the electron densities derived from [OIII]$λ$5008/[OIII]88$μ$m and [ArIV]$λ$4713/[ArIV]$λ$4742 ratios (log($n_e$[cm$^{-3}$])$\\sim$2.7-3.8), and previous values (log($n_e$[cm$^{-3}$])>4.8) based on high-ionization rest-UV emission lines. The ionized gas appears to be clumpy with a low filling factor ranging from about 10% to 0.2% for the low- and high-density clouds. In addition, we observe a very complex ISM kinematic structure, with the presence of two distinct broad and a very-broad components (FWHM$\\sim$210 and $\\sim$1000 kms$^{-1}$) in addition to the systemic one (FWHM$\\sim$60 kms$^{-1}$) in [OIII]$λ$5008 and H$α$. These broad components are heavily extinct (A$_V$$\\sim$1.5 and 2.5, respectively), based on their Balmer decrements, while the gas associated to the narrow component is consistent with no extinction. The maximal velocities of these outflows ($\\sim$115-500kms$^{-1}$) are such that a fraction of the total outflowing gas (0.16-2.1$\\times$10$^7$M$_\\odot$) could escape into the IGM. The rest of the gas will fall back to the central regions, being available for additional star formation episodes. The presence of dusty outflows and clumpy (i.e., low filling factor) ISM give support to the Attenuation-Free scenario proposed to explain the high-z UV-bright compact galaxies such as RXCJ2248-ID. On the other hand, the high densities in the ISM, together with the high SFR surface brightness, and the amount of returning outflowing mass give support to the Feedback-Free Starburst scenario."

Redundancy has also been integrated in MaxSAT [Ihalainen et.al'22, Berg et.al'23, Bonacina et.al'24]. In this paper, we define a structured hierarchy of redundancy proof systems for MaxSAT, with the goal of studying its proof complexity. We obtain MaxSAT variants of proof systems such as SPR, PR, SR, and others, previously defined for SAT. All our rules are polynomially checkable, unlike [Ihalainen et.al'22]. Moreover, they are simpler and weaker than [Berg et.al'23], and possibly amenable to lower bounds. This work also complements the approach of [Bonacina et.al'24]. Their proof systems use different rule sets for soft and hard clauses, while here we propose a system using only hard clauses and blocking variables. This is easier to integrate with current solvers and proof checkers. We discuss the strength of the systems introduced, we show some limitations of them, and we give a short cost-SR proof that any assignment for the weak pigeonhole principle $PHP^{m}_{n}$ falsifies at least $m-n$ clauses. We conclude by discussing the integration of our rules with the MaxSAT resolution proof system, which is a commonly studied proof system for MaxSAT."

In this work, we propose AutoTool, a novel graph-based framework that bypasses repeated LLM inference by exploiting a key empirical observation: tool usage inertia - the tendency of tool invocations to follow predictable sequential patterns. AutoTool constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories, where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, effectively modeling the inertia in tool selection. It further integrates parameter-level information to refine tool input generation. By traversing this structured representation, AutoTool efficiently selects tools and their parameters with minimal reliance on LLM inference. Extensive experiments across diverse agent tasks demonstrate that AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates, offering a practical and scalable enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks. Our work highlights the promise of integrating statistical structure into LLM agent design for greater efficiency without sacrificing performance."

To establish provable frequency bin shift invariance, we use adaptive polyphase sampling (APS) as pooling layers followed by a global average pooling layer at the end of the network. Using a synthetic dataset of common interference signals, experimental results demonstrate that unlike a vanilla CNN, our model maintains consistent classification accuracy with and without random Doppler shifts despite being trained on no Doppler-shifted examples.

Their short orbital separations make tidal dissipation within the stellar host especially efficient, potentially leading to a measurable evolution of the orbit. One possible manifestation of this is orbital decay, which presents itself observationally through variations in the orbital period and thus times of transit. Here we select four promising exoplanetary systems for detecting this effect: HIP 65, NGTS-6, NGTS-10 and WASP-173. We present 33 new transit light curves taken with the 1.54 m Danish Telescope, and analyse these alongside photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and transit timing data from the literature. We construct two ephemeris models for each target: a linear ephemeris and a shrinking orbital period due to tidal decay. The linear ephemeris is preferred for all four models - the highest significance for the quadratic ephemeris is 2 sigma for WASP-173. We compare these results to theoretical predictions for tidal dissipation of gravity waves in radiation zones, and find that wave breaking is predicted only in WASP-173, making rapid decay plausible in this system but unclear in the other three. The sensitivity of transit timings to orbital decay depends on the square of the time interval covered by available observations, so our results establish a useful baseline against which future measurements can be compared. NGTS-6 and NGTS-10 are important objects for future study as they are in the first field to be observed by the upcoming PLATO mission."

Vision-based fall prediction systems offer a non-invasive solution to anticipate falls seconds before impact, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of available fall data. Contributing to these efforts, this study proposes the Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN), a dual-stream model that combines both pose and biomechanical information using a cross-attention fusion mechanism. Our model outperforms the vanilla ST-GCN baseline by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on the simulated MCF-UA stunt-actor and MUVIM datasets, respectively. The spatio-temporal attention mechanisms in the ST-GCN stream also provide interpretability by identifying critical joints and temporal phases. However, a critical simulation-reality gap persists. While our model achieves an 89.0% F1-score with full supervision on simulated data, zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects drops to 35.9%. This performance decline is likely due to biases in simulated data, such as `intent-to-fall' cues. For older adults, particularly those with diabetes or frailty, this gap is exacerbated by their unique kinematic profiles. To address this, we propose personalization strategies and advocate for privacy-preserving data pipelines to enable real-world validation. Our findings underscore the urgent need to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data to develop effective fall prediction systems for vulnerable elderly populations."

We used electronic health record (EHR) data to dynamically track AKI patients' clinical evolution and characterize AKI-to-CKD progression. Post-AKI clinical states were identified by clustering patient vectors derived from longitudinal medical codes and creatinine measurements. Transition probabilities between states and progression to CKD were estimated using multi-state modeling. After identifying common post-AKI trajectories, CKD risk factors in AKI subpopulations were identified through survival analysis. Of 20,699 patients with AKI at admission, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD. We identified fifteen distinct post-AKI states, each with different probabilities of CKD development. Most patients (75%, n=15,607) remained in a single state or made only one transition during the study period. Both established (e.g., AKI severity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease) and novel CKD risk factors, with their impact varying across these clinical states. This study demonstrates a data-driven approach for identifying high-risk AKI patients, supporting the development of decision-support tools for early CKD detection and intervention."

For $k=2$, this equality yields the celebrated Euler's partition theorem. In this paper, we present a new partition set $E_k(n)$, which is equinumerous to $B_k(n)$."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show great promise for autonomous driving, but their suitability for safety-critical scenarios is largely unexplored, raising safety concerns. This issue arises from the lack of comprehensive benchmarks that assess both external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety simultaneously. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce DSBench, the first comprehensive Driving Safety Benchmark designed to assess a VLM's awareness of various safety risks in a unified manner. DSBench encompasses two major categories: external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety, divided into 10 key categories and a total of 28 sub-categories. This comprehensive evaluation covers a wide range of scenarios, ensuring a thorough assessment of VLMs' performance in safety-critical contexts. Extensive evaluations across various mainstream open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance degradation under complex safety-critical situations, highlighting urgent safety concerns. To address this, we constructed a large dataset of 98K instances focused on in-cabin and external safety scenarios, showing that fine-tuning on this dataset significantly enhances the safety performance of existing VLMs and paves the way for advancing autonomous driving technology. The benchmark toolkit, code, and model checkpoints will be publicly accessible."

    "abstract": "The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) started physics data taking on 26 August 2025. JUNO consists of a 20-kton liquid scintillator central detector, surrounded by a 35 kton water pool serving as a Cherenkov veto, and almost 1000 m$^2$ of plastic scintillator veto on top. The detector is located in a shallow underground laboratory with an overburden of 1800 m.w.e. This paper presents the performance results of the detector, extensively studied during the commissioning of the water phase, the subsequent liquid scintillator filling phase, and the first physics runs. The liquid scintillator achieved an attenuation length of 20.6 m at 430 nm, while the high coverage PMT system and scintillator together yielded about 1785 photoelectrons per MeV of energy deposit at the detector centre, measured using the 2.223 MeV $γ$ from neutron captures on hydrogen with an Am-C calibration source. The reconstructed energy resolution is 3.4% for two 0.511 MeV $γ$ at the detector centre and 2.9% for the 0.93 MeV quenched Po-214 alpha decays from natural radioactive sources. The energy nonlinearity is calibrated to better than 1%. Intrinsic contaminations of U-238 and Th-232 in the liquid scintillator are below 10$^{-16}$ g/g, assuming secular equilibrium. The water Cherenkov detector achieves a muon detection efficiency better than 99.9% for muons traversing the liquid scintillator volume. During the initial science runs, the data acquisition duty cycle exceeded 97.8%, demonstrating the excellent stability and readiness of JUNO for high-precision neutrino physics."

    "abstract": "White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are key imaging markers in cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and related dementias. Although automated methods for WMH segmentation have advanced, most provide only global lesion load and overlook their spatial distribution across distinct white matter regions. We propose a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, are reproducibly associated with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD. These results highlight the added value of regional WMH quantification. Incorporating localized lesion metrics alongside atrophy markers may enhance early diagnosis and stratification in neurodegenerative disorders."

    "abstract": "Directional-change Intrinsic Time analysis has long revealed scaling laws in market microstructure, but the origin of their stability remains elusive. This article presents evidence that Intrinsic Time can be modeled as a memoryless exponential hazard process. Empirically, the proportion of directional changes to total events stabilizes near $1 - 1/e = 0.632$, matching the probability that a Poisson process completes one mean interval. This constant provides a natural heuristic to identify scaling regimes across thresholds and supports an interpretation of market activity as a renewal process in intrinsic time."

    "abstract": "Processing-in-memory (PIM) reduces data movement by executing near memory, but our large-scale characterization on real PIM hardware shows that end-to-end performance is often limited by disjoint host and device address spaces that force explicit staging transfers. In contrast, CXL-PIM provides a unified address space and cache-coherent access at the cost of higher access latency. These opposing interface models create workload-dependent tradeoffs that are not captured by small-scale studies. This work presents a side-by-side, large-scale comparison of PIM and CXL-PIM using measurements from real PIM hardware and trace-driven CXL modeling. We identify when unified-address access amortizes link latency enough to overcome transfer bottlenecks, and when tightly coupled PIM remains preferable. Our results reveal phase- and dataset-size regimes in which the relative ranking between the two architectures reverses, offering practical guidance for future near-memory system design."

With timely screening and intervention, the condition can be prevented from causing irreversible damage. The work introduces a state-of-the-art Ordinal Regression-based DR Detection framework that uses the APTOS-2019 fundus image dataset. A widely accepted combination of preprocessing methods: Green Channel (GC) Extraction, Noise Masking, and CLAHE, was used to isolate the most relevant features for DR classification. Model performance was evaluated using the Quadratic Weighted Kappa, with a focus on agreement between results and clinical grading. Our Ordinal Regression approach attained a QWK score of 0.8992, setting a new benchmark on the APTOS dataset."

    "abstract": "Information scrambling, the process by which quantum information spreads and becomes effectively inaccessible, is central to modern quantum statistical physics and quantum chaos. These lecture notes provide an introduction to information scrambling from both static and dynamical perspectives. The spectral properties of reduced density matrices arising from Haar-random states are developed through the geometry of the unitary group and the universal results of random matrix theory. This geometric framework yields universal, model-independent predictions for entanglement and spectral statistics, capturing generic features of quantum chaos without reference to microscopic details. Dynamical diagnostics such as the spectral form factor and out-of-time-ordered correlators further reveal the onset of chaos in time-dependent evolution. The notes are aimed at advanced undergraduate and graduate students in physics, mathematics, and computer science who are interested in the connections between quantum chaos, information dynamics, and quantum computing. Concepts such as entanglement growth, Haar randomness, random-matrix statistics, and unitary t-designs are introduced through their realization in random quantum circuits and circuit complexity. The same mathematical framework also underpins modern quantum-device benchmarking, where approximate unitary designs and random circuits translate geometric ideas into quantitative tools for assessing fidelity, noise, and scrambling efficiency in real quantum processors."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making and planning in autonomous driving, showing promising reasoning capabilities and potential to generalize across diverse traffic situations. However, current LLM-based driving agents lack explicit mechanisms to enforce traffic rules and often struggle to reliably detect small, safety-critical objects such as traffic lights and signs. To address this limitation, we introduce TLS-Assist, a modular redundancy layer that augments LLM-based autonomous driving agents with explicit traffic light and sign recognition. TLS-Assist converts detections into structured natural language messages that are injected into the LLM input, enforcing explicit attention to safety-critical cues. The framework is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and supports both single-view and multi-view camera setups. We evaluate TLS-Assist in a closed-loop setup on the LangAuto benchmark in CARLA. The results demonstrate relative driving performance improvements of up to 14% over LMDrive and 7% over BEVDriver, while consistently reducing traffic light and sign infractions. We publicly release the code and models on https://github.com/iis-esslingen/TLS-Assist."

    "abstract": "Though deep neural models adopted to realize the perception of autonomous driving have proven vulnerable to adversarial examples, known attacks often leverage 2D patches and target mostly monocular perception. Therefore, the effectiveness of Physical Adversarial Examples (PAEs) on stereo-based binocular depth estimation remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the first texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models in the context of autonomous driving. Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision. We further propose a novel merging attack that seamlessly blends the target into the environment through fine-grained PAE optimization. It has significantly enhanced stealth and lethality upon existing hiding attacks that fail to get seamlessly merged into the background. Extensive evaluations show that our PAEs can successfully fool the stereo models into producing erroneous depth information."

    "abstract": "The paper reports the results of measuring the total dose of X-ray bremsstrahlung from a powerful X-ray source based on the high-current pulsed direct-action electron accelerator Temp-B. The parameters of the high-current, tubular relativistic electron beam from the accelerator were as follows: energy 600 keV, current 13.5 kA, and pulse duration 1.0 mks. Using the pulsed magnetic field of a solenoid, the electron beam generated in a magnetically isolated diode was transported over a 55 cm distance toward the molybdenum converter. An auxiliary coil, connected in series with the solenoid, was placed adjacent to it to provide the desired magnetic field in the converter region and avoid beam losses. The methodology for determining the total dose of the produced X-ray bremsstrahlung is described. Polycrystalline detectors were used for measuring the X-ray bremsstrahlung dose. They were located 80 mm behind the converter in the polar plane, with a 20 deg separation. Measurements of the dose distribution over the polar angle showed symmetrical distributions of the radiation at both polar and azimuthal angles relative to the axis. Taking into account such symmetry and the fact that the electron beam radiates solely into the forward hemisphere, the integration over the entire sphere can be reduced to integration over just a fraction of 1/8 of the spherical surface, thereby reducing the required number of sensors. The experimentally obtained value of the total dose of the X-ray bremsstrahlung is 388.5 Gy per single pulse of the accelerator current, which is concentrated in a 120 deg cone in the direction of the beam movement."

Specifically, they struggle to comprehend hand-drawn sketches, a modality that offers an intuitive means of expressing concepts that are difficult to describe textually. We identify the primary bottleneck as the absence of a large-scale dataset that jointly models sketches, photorealistic images, and corresponding natural language instructions. To address this, we present two key contributions: (1) a new, large-scale dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets designed to facilitate both pretraining and instruction tuning, and (2) O3SLM, an LVLM trained on this dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple sketch-based tasks: (a) object localization, (b) counting, (c) image retrieval i.e., (SBIR and fine-grained SBIR), and (d) visual question answering (VQA); while incorporating the three existing sketch datasets, namely QuickDraw!, Sketchy, and Tu Berlin, along with our generated SketchVCL dataset, show that O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing LVLMs in sketch comprehension and reasoning."

On the other hand, it was recently shown that, in resistive magnetohydrodynamics, the interplay between the Israel-Stewart relaxation equation and the Ampère-Maxwell law can give rise to a pair of oscillating non-hydrodynamic modes. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon in detail. We first demonstrate that these oscillatory modes are exact solutions of the Drude model, corresponding to ordinary plasma oscillations. We then invoke the Onsager-Casimir principle to explain that their oscillatory nature reflects the distinct PT-transformation properties of the degrees of freedom: the distribution function is even, while the electric field is odd. Finally, we establish that, in a kinetic theory of charged particles, there can be at most one such pair of oscillatory modes per spatial dimension, while all other modes still must sit on the imaginary axis."

These factors hinder the stability of appearance-based similarity metrics and often lead to convergence failures or anatomically implausible alignments. To address these limitations, we propose DentalSCR, a pose-stable, contour-guided framework for accurate and interpretable silhouette-to-contour registration. Our method first constructs a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) to establish a unified cross-arch anatomical coordinate system, thereby stabilizing initialization and standardizing projection geometry across cases. Using this reference frame, we generate radiograph-like projections via a surface-based DRR formulation with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting, which preserves clinical source-object-detector magnification and emphasizes external silhouettes. Registration is then formulated as a 2D similarity transform optimized with a symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under a hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule, enabling both large capture range and subpixel-level contour agreement. We evaluate DentalSCR on 34 expert-annotated clinical cases. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in landmark error-particularly at posterior teeth-tighter dispersion on the lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at the curve level. These findings indicate that DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms and delivers high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D--2D alignment, outperforming conventional baselines."

Thanks to the capabilities of new generation telescopes and computers, a growing amount of observational and theoretical results have been recently obtained, which have important implications not only for our understanding of the (still mysterious) formation process of high-mass stars, but also for the chemistry that the primordial Solar System might have inherited from its birth environment. In this review, we summarise the main observational and theoretical results achieved in the last decades in the study of chemistry evolution in high-mass star-forming regions, and in the identification of chemical evolutionary indicators. Emphasis is especially given to observational studies, for which most of the work has been carried out so far. A comparison with the chemical evolution occurring in other astrophysical environments, in particular in low-mass star-forming cores and extragalactic cores, is also briefly presented. Current open questions and future perspectives are discussed."

    "abstract": "Dynamic fragmentation simulations are essential for predicting material response at high strain rates, yet explicit dynamic simulations that combine an extrinsic cohesive-zone model (CZM) with penalty-based contact often exhibit severe instabilities. In a two-dimensional benchmark, we observe exponential energy growth and resulting artificial fragmentation under standard contact penalty settings and time step choices, which motivates a systematic analysis of instability sources. Three mechanisms are isolated and quantified: (i) diverging initial cohesive stiffness, which constrains the stable time step; (ii) discontinuous stiffness jumps at the cohesive-contact interface; and (iii) discontinuity introduced by cohesive softening. Analytical error estimates, phase-space diagnostics, and energy growth metrics reveal that repeated cohesive-contact switching can accumulate small per-step energy errors into long-term energy drift. Within the explored parameter space, maintaining stability requires time steps well below the usual limit. To mitigate these energy artifacts, we assess an adaptive penalty strategy that ties the contact stiffness to the evolving cohesive stiffness. This modification eliminates the discontinuity and restores energy conservation, but it allows larger interpenetration, making it suitable as a diagnostic rather than a definitive remedy. Overall, our study identifies the root causes of unphysical energy drift and demonstrates that penalty-based contact is not a viable approach for long-term, energy-consistent fragmentation simulations with physically meaningful fragment statistics."

Here, we present an alternative driving-based method that allows to extract the full harmonic content of a CPR in a non-invasive way, by fitting the measured critical currents of the driven junction as a function of driving power. We test our method, both using numerical simulations and in experiments, and we show that it works very accurately, also in the presence of noise."

These constraints reduce the quality and stability of pseudo-labels, while large models, though more accurate, cannot be trained or used for routine inference on client devices. We propose SAM-Fed, a federated semi-supervised framework that leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients during training. SAM-Fed combines dual knowledge distillation with an adaptive agreement mechanism to refine pixel-level supervision. Experiments on skin lesion and polyp segmentation across homogeneous and heterogeneous settings show that SAM-Fed consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSSL methods."

To aid interpretation, we derive summary indicators from model parameters capturing possession speed, number of events, and spatial dynamics. Parameters are estimated through maximum likelihood via Generalized Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Applied to StatsBomb data from 38 Ligue 1 matches (2020/2021), our approach uncovers distinct defensive possession patterns faced by Stade Rennais.

However, existing parameterizations of implicit fields lack explicit mechanisms to ensure a tight fit between the surface and input data. To address this, we propose a novel energy equation that balances the reliability of point cloud information. Additionally, we introduce a new convolutional network that learns three-dimensional information to achieve superior optimization results. This approach ensures that the reconstructed surface closely adheres to the raw input points and infers valuable inductive biases from point clouds, resulting in a highly accurate and stable surface reconstruction.

    "abstract": "Text-to-3D generation has advanced rapidly, yet state-of-the-art models, encompassing both optimization-based and feed-forward architectures, still face two fundamental limitations. First, they struggle with coarse semantic alignment, often failing to capture fine-grained prompt details. Second, they lack robust 3D spatial understanding, leading to geometric inconsistencies and catastrophic failures in part assembly and spatial relationships. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a general framework that repurposes large vision-language models (VLMs) as powerful, differentiable semantic and spatial critics. Our core contribution is a dual-query critic signal derived from the VLM's Yes or No log-odds, which assesses both semantic fidelity and geometric coherence. We demonstrate the generality of this guidance signal across two distinct paradigms: (1) As a reward objective for optimization-based pipelines, VLM3D significantly outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks. (2) As a test-time guidance module for feed-forward pipelines, it actively steers the iterative sampling process of SOTA native 3D models to correct severe spatial errors. VLM3D establishes a principled and generalizable path to inject the VLM's rich, language-grounded understanding of both semantics and space into diverse 3D generative pipelines."

    "abstract": "Large reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet the excessive length of their chain-of-thought outputs remains a major practical bottleneck due to high computation cost and poor deployability. Existing compression methods have achieved partial success but overlook a crucial phenomenon in the training process -- the entropy conflict. During compression training, entropy decreases, leading to shorter reasoning but limited exploration, while accuracy-oriented objectives increase entropy, lengthening reasoning chains. This can cause the model to get stuck in a local dilemma. Our analysis further reveals the origin of the entropy conflict: many high-entropy tokens are logical connectors that receive larger gradients and are encouraged under the performance objective, while the compression objective simultaneously penalizes these potentially redundant connectors. This opposing pressure creates a direct source of entropy conflict. To address these issues, we adopt an entropy-guided training framework. As entropy descends, the model is guided toward efficient reasoning by encouraging concise thought steps; as entropy rises, exploration is reinforced under the compact reasoning mode to improve robustness. Experiments on six mathematical benchmarks show that our method compresses reasoning length to 20% of the original while maintaining or even surpassing baseline accuracy. Code and models will be released publicly."

With the available high-resolution UV observations from AstroSat-UVIT, complemented by GALEX, we studied the SF properties in the outskirts ($>0.5R_{25}$) of six AGN-host galaxies and compared them with four non-AGN galaxies of similar morphology. We observed a higher SF rate density ($Σ_{\\text{SFR}}$) for the UV knots in AGN-host galaxies, and it falls off less rapidly compared to non-AGN galaxies, suggesting positive AGN feedback in the outskirts of AGN-host galaxies. Additionally, FUV attenuation (A$_{\\text{FUV}}$) is also enhanced in the outer regions and falls less rapidly in AGN-host compared to non-AGN, indicating that the feedback could be coupled with dust. We speculate that the radiation-pressure-driven and/or wind mode AGN feedback could be at play even in low-luminosity nearby AGN-host galaxies."

The estimated SF rate (SFR) averaged over 100 Myr for the UV knot ($0.23\\pm0.10$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) is significantly higher compared to a typical elliptical galaxy. As the galaxy does not show the signatures of recent major mergers, the possible mechanisms for the triggered SF include AGN feedback or minor mergers. Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) observations reveal dust filaments that extend through a UV knot. The origin of dusty filaments, though not clear, could be associated with gas clouds as a result of a minor merger, cooled gas falling into the central BCG and/or condensing of the gas uplifted by AGN jet. No significant clumpy UV emission is observed in other regions along the dust filament. We speculate that mechanical feedback from the AGN jet could be playing a role in triggering SF in the UV knot."

    "abstract": "Multi-agents rely on accurate poses to share and align observations, enabling a collaborative perception of the environment. However, traditional GNSS-based localization often fails in GNSS-denied environments, making consistent feature alignment difficult in collaboration. To tackle this challenge, we propose a robust GNSS-free collaborative perception framework based on LiDAR localization. Specifically, we propose a lightweight Pose Generator with Confidence (PGC) to estimate compact pose and confidence representations. To alleviate the effects of localization errors, we further develop the Pose-Aware Spatio-Temporal Alignment Transformer (PASTAT), which performs confidence-aware spatial alignment while capturing essential temporal context. Additionally, we present a new simulation dataset, V2VLoc, which can be adapted for both LiDAR localization and collaborative detection tasks. V2VLoc comprises three subsets: Town1Loc, Town4Loc, and V2VDet. Town1Loc and Town4Loc offer multi-traversal sequences for training in localization tasks, whereas V2VDet is specifically intended for the collaborative detection task. Extensive experiments conducted on the V2VLoc dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance under GNSS-denied conditions. We further conduct extended experiments on the real-world V2V4Real dataset to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PASTAT."

    "abstract": "Forecasting 3D human motion is an important embodiment of fine-grained understanding and cognition of human behavior by artificial agents. Current approaches excessively rely on implicit network modeling of spatiotemporal relationships and motion characteristics, falling into the passive learning trap that results in redundant and monotonous 3D coordinate information acquisition while lacking actively guided explicit learning mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose an Active Perceptual Strategy (APS) for human motion prediction, leveraging quotient space representations to explicitly encode motion properties while introducing auxiliary learning objectives to strengthen spatio-temporal modeling. Specifically, we first design a data perception module that projects poses into the quotient space, decoupling motion geometry from coordinate redundancy. By jointly encoding tangent vectors and Grassmann projections, this module simultaneously achieves geometric dimension reduction, semantic decoupling, and dynamic constraint enforcement for effective motion pose characterization. Furthermore, we introduce a network perception module that actively learns spatio-temporal dependencies through restorative learning. This module deliberately masks specific joints or injects noise to construct auxiliary supervision signals. A dedicated auxiliary learning network is designed to actively adapt and learn from perturbed information. Notably, APS is model agnostic and can be integrated with different prediction models to enhance active perceptual. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods by large margins: 16.3% on H3.6M, 13.9% on CMU Mocap, and 10.1% on 3DPW."

However, existing generative models focus solely on structural aspects of materials during generation, while overlooking the underlying electronic behavior that fundamentally governs materials' stability and functionality. In this work, we present ChargeDIFF, the first generative model for inorganic materials that explicitly incorporates electronic structure into the generation process. Specifically, ChargeDIFF leverages charge density, a direct spatial representation of a material's electronic structure, as an additional modality for generation. ChargeDIFF demonstrates exceptional performance in both unconditional and conditional generation tasks compared to baseline models, with ablation studies revealing that this improvement is directly due to its ability to capture the material's electronic structure during generation. Moreover, the ability to control charge density during generation allows ChargeDIFF to introduce a novel inverse design method based on three-dimensional charge density, illustrating the potential to generate lithium-ion battery cathode materials with desired ion migration pathways, as validated by physics-based simulations. By highlighting the importance of accounting for electronic characteristics during material generation, ChargeDIFF offers new possibilities in the generative design of stable and functional materials."

    "abstract": "Nearest level modulation (NLM) is an attractive modulation method for its implementation simplicity in modular multilevel converter (MMC). However, it introduces significant voltage and current distortion when the number of submodules (SMs) per arm is small, as in medium-voltage applications. While indirect modulation offers fully decoupled control of ac-side current, dc-side current and SM capacitor energy, its performance is fundamentally reliant on accurate arm voltage synthesis, making it incompatible with the large quantization error inherent in NLM. To resolve this conflict, this paper proposes a new control strategy based on a disturbance observer (DOB). The key idea is to estimate and actively compensate for the inevitable arm voltage synthesis error induced by NLM, thereby enabling fully decoupled control of indirect-modulated MMC even under NLM operation with a small number of SMs. A key advantage is its ease of implementation, as it requires no modifications to the conventional NLM and decoupled control structure. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed method in improving current quality and decoupled SM energy control are verified through both simulation and experimental results."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in finance and economics, where prompt-based attempts against look-ahead bias implicitly assume that models understand chronology. We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps. These patterns are important for the real-time application of LLMs in finance. We release all code and evaluation templates to support full reproducibility."

Specifically, we formulate BFR as a measurement-constrained generative task by constructing an inverse problem through controlled degradations of coarse restorations, which allows posterior-guided sampling within text-to-image diffusion. Measurement constraints include both Forward Measurement, which ensures results align with input structures, and Reverse Measurement, which produces projection spaces, ensuring that the solution can align with various prompts. Experiments show that our MCS can generate prompt-aligned results and outperforms existing BFR methods. Codes will be released after acceptance."

Here, we show that the slow relaxation that is associated with the disorder-broadened density of (localized) states leads to a strong electric field F dependence of the charge carrier mobility. We interpret the results in terms of an increased effective electronic temperature T_eff that exceeds that of the lattice. We use a heat balance model to derive an analytical expression for T_eff (F) that is similar to, and puts a physical basis under the phenomenological expression proposed by Marianer and Shklovskii [Phys. Rev. B 46, 13100 (1992)]. We apply this model to analyze the field- and temperature-dependent conductivity in ZnO QDs with varying ligand length and depletion shell thickness and find (effective) localization lengths ranging from 2 to 5 nm. Both experimental and analytical results compare favorably to numerical simulations by kinetic Monte Carlo. Due to the large value of the effective localization length, the field dependence already becomes relevant at modest fields around 1-10 V/micron, that are typical for operational conditions of photovoltaic and light emitting devices based on quantum dot solids."

To achieve fast and data-efficient new subject adaptation, we propose MindCross, a novel cross-subject framework. MindCross's N specific encoders and one shared encoder are designed to extract subject-specific and subject-invariant information, respectively. Additionally, a Top-K collaboration module is adopted to enhance new subject decoding with the knowledge learned from previous subjects' encoders.

    "abstract": "LLMs still struggle with hallucination, especially when confronted with symbolic triggers like modifiers, negation, numbers, exceptions, and named entities. Yet, we lack a clear understanding of where these symbolic hallucinations originate, making it crucial to systematically handle such triggers and localize the emergence of hallucination inside the model. While prior work explored localization using statistical techniques like LSC and activation variance analysis, these methods treat all tokens equally and overlook the role symbolic linguistic knowledge plays in triggering hallucinations. So far, no approach has investigated how symbolic elements specifically drive hallucination failures across model layers, nor has symbolic linguistic knowledge been used as the foundation for a localization framework. We propose the first symbolic localization framework that leverages symbolic linguistic and semantic knowledge to meaningfully trace the development of hallucinations across all model layers. By focusing on how models process symbolic triggers, we analyze five models using HaluEval and TruthfulQA. Our symbolic knowledge approach reveals that attention variance for these linguistic elements explodes to critical instability in early layers (2-4), with negation triggering catastrophic variance levels, demonstrating that symbolic semantic processing breaks down from the very beginning. Through the lens of symbolic linguistic knowledge, despite larger model sizes, hallucination rates remain consistently high (78.3%-83.7% across Gemma variants), with steep attention drops for symbolic semantic triggers throughout deeper layers. Our findings demonstrate that hallucination is fundamentally a symbolic linguistic processing failure, not a general generation problem, revealing that symbolic semantic knowledge provides the key to understanding and localizing hallucination mechanisms in LLMs."

Additionally, the traditional patch-wise scanning tokenization workflow misaligns with the human vision cognition system, further leading to hallucination and computational redundancy. To address this issue, we propose an object-level token merging strategy for Adaptive Token compression, revealing the consistency with human vision system.

To address these challenges, we propose Certified Signed Graph Unlearning (CSGU), which provides provable privacy guarantees while preserving the sociological principles underlying SGNNs.

To address this gap, we conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with 14 lonely, terminally ill individuals. Our core contributions are: (1) An empirically-grounded model articulating the complex psychological, practical, social, and spiritual needs of this group; (2) The \"Three Pillars, Twelve Principles\" framework for designing IUIs as \"Existential Companions\"; and (3) A critical design directive derived from user evaluations: technology in this context should aim for transcendence over simulation. The findings suggest that IUIs should create experiences that augment or surpass human capabilities, rather than attempting to simulate basic human connections, which can paradoxically deepen loneliness. This research provides a clear, user-centered path for designing technology that serves not as a \"tool for dying,\" but as a \"partner for living fully until the end\"."

    "abstract": "Household tidying is an important application area, yet current benchmarks neither model user preferences nor support mobility, and they generalize poorly, making it hard to comprehensively assess integrated language-to-action capabilities. To address this, we propose RoboTidy, a unified benchmark for language-guided household tidying that supports Vision-Language-Action (VLA) and Vision-Language-Navigation (VLN) training and evaluation. RoboTidy provides 500 photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) household scenes (covering 500 objects and containers) with collisions, formulates tidying as an \"Action (Object, Container)\" list, and supplies 6.4k high-quality manipulation demonstration trajectories and 1.5k naviagtion trajectories to support both few-shot and large-scale training. We also deploy RoboTidy in the real world for object tidying, establishing an end-to-end benchmark for household tidying. RoboTidy offers a scalable platform and bridges a key gap in embodied AI by enabling holistic and realistic evaluation of language-guided robots."

The HVAC system supplies to nine university buildings with an annual average electricity consumption of $\\sim2$ GWh. Updated chiller Coefficient of Performance (COP) curves are identified, and a predictive building cooling demand model is developed using historical data from the HVAC system. Based on these inputs, a Proximal Policy Optimization based RL model is trained to optimally schedule the chillers in a receding horizon control framework with a priority reward function for constraint satisfaction. Compared to the traditional way of controlling the HVAC system based on a reactive rule-based method, the proposed controller saves up to 28\\% of the electricity consumed by simply controlling the mass flow rates of the chiller banks and with minimal constraint violations."

Existing token compression methods have yet to accommodate this emerging need of jointly compressing multimodal tokens. To bridge this gap, we present OmniZip, a training-free, audio-guided audio-visual token-compression framework that optimizes multimodal token representation and accelerates inference. Specifically, OmniZip first identifies salient audio tokens, then computes an audio retention score for each time group to capture information density, thereby dynamically guiding video token pruning and preserving cues from audio anchors enhanced by cross-modal similarity. For each time window, OmniZip compresses the video tokens using an interleaved spatio-temporal scheme. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the merits of OmniZip - it achieves 3.42X inference speedup and 1.4X memory reduction over other top-performing counterparts, while maintaining performance with no training."

The main difficulty is studying $L$-functions which are associated to $D_4$-fields whose quadratic subfield is of large discriminant. These $L$-functions are studied by utilising the so-called flipped field of a $D_4$ extension, combining a method introduced by Friedrichsen for counting $D_4$-fields, with explicit ramification theory in such fields provided by Altuğ, Shankar, Varma and Wilson."

We base our sample on integral field spectroscopy from the MaNGA data in SDSS-IV's DR17. Starting with MaNGA's calibrated row-stacked spectra, we produce new spectroscopic data cubes with minimal covariance between spaxels and higher resolution point spread functions (PSF), and then extract line fluxes for the central PSF. Using the line ratio diagnostic techniques of Ji & Yan (2020), we identify AGN galaxies and determine their H$β$ and [O III] line luminosities. For all galaxies not identified as AGN, we determine the threshold line luminosity they would have needed to be identified as AGN. These luminosity thresholds are essential to determine, because many star forming galaxies likely host AGN of significant luminosity that are unidentified because they are outshone by star formation related emission. We show that ignoring these selection effects when measuring the Eddington ratio distribution would lead to biased results. From the H$β$ luminosities and luminosity detection thresholds, accounting for selection effects, we measure the luminosity and Eddington ratio distributions of Seyferts as a function of specific star formation rate (sSFR) and stellar mass. Defining $F_{\\rm AGN}$ as the occurrence rate of AGN above a fixed Eddington ratio of $10^{-3}$, we find that $F_{\\rm AGN}$ is constant or increasing with stellar mass for star forming galaxies and declines strongly with stellar mass for quiescent galaxies. At stellar masses $\\log_{10} M_\\ast > 10.25$, the occurrence rate increases monotonically with sSFR. These patterns reveal a complicated dependence of AGN activity on galaxy properties for theoretical models to explain."

Our approach enables comparison between model-extracted and human-annotated claim sets, serving as a metric for assessing the extraction performance of models and also as a possible measure of inter-annotator agreement. We conduct experiments on newly collected dataset-claims extracted from comments under Czech and Slovak news articles-domains that pose additional challenges due to the informal language, strong local context, and subtleties of these closely related languages.

The underlying physically relevant model is a nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation with a periodic potential. We consider the evolution of piecewise smooth initial data composed of two distinct nonlinear periodic eigenmodes. To begin interpreting the resulting wave dynamics, we employ the tight-binding approximation, reducing the continuous system to a discrete NLS (DNLS) model with piecewise constant initial data (i.e., a Riemann problem), where each constant state represents a discrete Floquet-Bloch mode at the continuum model level. The resulting tight-binding approximation is shown to display higher-fidelity for {deeper} periodic potentials. This reduced DNLS model effectively models the dynamics at the minima of the periodic potential of the original continuum NLS. Within such a single-band DNLS framework, we apply tools from Whitham modulation theory and long-wave quasi-continuum reductions to uncover and analyze a rich spectrum of non-convex, discrete dispersive hydrodynamic phenomena, comparing the resulting phenomenology with that of the periodic-potential-bearing continuum model."

    "abstract": "Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have been a vital representation to represent 3D shapes or scenes with neural networks. An SDF is an implicit function that can query signed distances at specific coordinates for recovering a 3D surface. Although implicit functions work well on a single shape or scene, they pose obstacles when analyzing multiple SDFs with high-fidelity geometry details, due to the limited information encoded in the latent space for SDFs and the loss of geometry details. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a method to represent multiple SDFs in a common space, aiming to recover more high-fidelity geometry details with more compact latent representations. Our key idea is to take full advantage of the benefits of generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies, which manage to preserve high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent codes. Based on this framework, we also introduce a novel sampling strategy to sample training queries. The sampling can improve the training efficiency and eliminate artifacts caused by the influence of other SDFs. We report numerical and visual evaluations on widely used benchmarks to validate our designs and show advantages over the latest methods in terms of the representative ability and compactness."

The models were trained and tested on a dataset consisting of games played by amateur players involving students, faculty, and staff at Roanoke College. The five models are: the null model, which is based only on the live scores, a logistic regression model, a basic simulation model, a time-adjusted simulation model, and a new variation of the Massey model which updates based on the current score. We evaluate these models using two approaches. First, we compare their Brier scores. Second, we conduct head-to-head comparisons in a betting game in which one model sets the betting odds while the other places bets. In both cases, model performance is assessed not only at the start of the game but also at the start of each round. Across both evaluation methods, the score-dependent Massey model performs the best. We conclude by illustrating how this score-dependent Massey model framework can be adapted to other competitive settings beyond darts."

    "abstract": "Data-driven techniques have improved the accuracy of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models in fluid dynamics. However, modeling separated flows remains challenging due to their complex physics and sensitivity to local conditions. Existing approaches often struggle with generalization beyond training cases and lack robust uncertainty quantification frameworks, limiting their utility in complex flow regimes. We propose a Bayesian neural network (BNN)-based framework specifically designed for two-dimensional separated flows. By focusing on flow zones near separated regions, we ensure targeted training and enhance predictive reliability. The BNN framework incorporates physics-guided, invariant inputs to maintain consistency with turbulence physics. Correction terms predicted by the BNN are selectively applied to specific regions of the flow domain using a novel classifier, improving accuracy. A key feature of this approach is propagating BNN-derived corrections to flow solutions, enabling uncertainty quantification in unseen test cases. This probabilistic characterization of modeling errors offers insights into the reliability of RANS predictions across geometries with similar topologies. Preliminary results demonstrate that this method accurately predicts correction terms for Reynolds stress anisotropy and turbulent kinetic energy production in separated flow regions, effectively addressing dominant modeling errors and advancing turbulence modeling through uncertainty quantification."

From the viable regions of the parameter space, we compute the production cross sections, including all two-body decay modes of the charged Higgs boson. We mention that all two-body decay modes of the charged Higgs boson are evaluated with one-loop electroweak corrections, with two-loop QCD corrections also included for the decays of the charged Higgs into two fermions. The signal significances are also examined for several benchmark points within the updated parameter space. It is worth emphasizing that the production cross sections used for computing the significances in this work include initial-state radiation corrections up to two-loop order.

In contrast to conventional sub-connected (SC) PASS, the proposed FC architecture employs a tunable phase-shifter network to interconnect all radio frequency (RF) chains with all waveguides. This facilitates a THB framework that integrates conventional hybrid analog-digital beamforming with pinching beamforming. A weighted sum-rate (WSR) optimization problem is then formulated to jointly optimize the transmit beamformers and pinching antenna (PA) positions. Two algorithms are developed to address this challenging non-convex problem. 1) Fractional programming (FP)-based algorithm: This algorithm directly maximizes the WSR using an FP-based alternating optimization framework. Particularly, a success-history based adaptive differential evolution (SHADE) method is proposed to optimize PA positions, effectively addressing the intractable multimodal objective function. 2) Zero-forcing (ZF)-based algorithm: To reduce design complexity, zero-forcing is employed for transmit beamforming. The PA positions are subsequently optimized to maximize the WSR via a modified SHADE method. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, revealing that the FC-THB PASS achieves WSR comparable to the SC architecture while delivering superior energy efficiency with fewer RF chains."

    "abstract": "Diffusion and flow matching models have recently emerged as promising approaches for peptide binder design. Despite their progress, these models still face two major challenges. First, categorical sampling of discrete residue types collapses their continuous parameters into onehot assignments, while continuous variables (e.g., atom positions) evolve smoothly throughout the generation process. This mismatch disrupts the update dynamics and results in suboptimal performance. Second, current models assume unimodal distributions for side-chain torsion angles, which conflicts with the inherently multimodal nature of side chain rotameric states and limits prediction accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce PepBFN, the first Bayesian flow network for full atom peptide design that directly models parameter distributions in fully continuous space. Specifically, PepBFN models discrete residue types by learning their continuous parameter distributions, enabling joint and smooth Bayesian updates with other continuous structural parameters. It further employs a novel Gaussian mixture based Bayesian flow to capture the multimodal side chain rotameric states and a Matrix Fisher based Riemannian flow to directly model residue orientations on the $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ manifold. Together, these parameter distributions are progressively refined via Bayesian updates, yielding smooth and coherent peptide generation. Experiments on side chain packing, reverse folding, and binder design tasks demonstrate the strong potential of PepBFN in computational peptide design."

The approach enables the characterization of as small as $3 \\times 3$~{\\textmu}m$^2$ exfoliated flakes on a non-transmissive substrate without assuming any specific spectral shape of the refractive index. Exfoliated flakes are most commonly obtained through mechanical exfoliation, which generally produces vdW flakes with tens-of-micron lateral dimensions. As a result, conventional ellipsometry - which depends on large, uniform areas and specific spectral models - becomes challenging to apply. Our method determines the refractive index directly from the spectral position of reflectivity minima, provided the flake thickness and the substrate complex refractive index are known. We demonstrate the technique on hafnium disulfide (HfS$_2$), a vdW semiconductor with high refractive index and low absorption, retrieving its in-plane refractive index across the visible range. The results both validate previous ellipsometry measurements and establish this method as an accessible and spectral-model-free alternative for refractive index characterization of vdW materials."

    "abstract": "Join ordering is the NP-hard problem of selecting the most efficient sequence in which to evaluate joins (conjunctive, binary operators) in a database query. As the performance of query execution critically depends on this choice, join ordering lies at the core of query optimization. Traditional approaches cast this problem as a discrete combinatorial search over binary trees guided by a cost model, but they often suffer from high computational complexity and limited scalability. We show that, when the cost model is differentiable, the query plans can be continuously relaxed into a soft adjacency matrix representing a superposition of plans. This continuous relaxation, together with a Gumbel-Softmax parameterization of the adjacency matrix and differentiable constraints enforcing plan validity, enables gradient-based search for plans within this relaxed space. Using a learned Graph Neural Network as the cost model, we demonstrate that this gradient-based approach can find comparable and even lower-cost plans compared to traditional discrete local search methods on two different graph datasets. Furthermore, we empirically show that the runtime of this approach scales linearly with query size, in contrast to quadratic or exponential runtimes of classical approaches. We believe this first step towards gradient-based join ordering can lead to more effective and efficient query optimizers in the future."

Particle paths exhibit metric-governed anisotropic diffusion under random boundary forcing. Our geometric concepts, though developed explicitly for circulation-driven Hele-Shaw flows, generalize to generic driven Stokes flows and so elucidate recent observations in a three-dimensional context."

The optimality map represents the system of first order optimality conditions (Pontryagin maximum principle), and its regularity is of key importance for the qualitative and numerical analysis of optimal control problems. The case of affine problems is especially challenging due to the typical discontinuity of the optimal control functions. A remarkable feature of the obtained sufficient conditions is that they do not require convexity of the objective functional. As an application, the result is used for proving uniform convergence of the Euler discretization method for a family of affine optimal control problems."

    "abstract": "In the maritime sector, tramp shipping companies manage fleets to maximize profit while navigating market uncertainties. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) recently introduced the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, further complicating deployment decisions. This paper introduces a novel two-stage stochastic programming model for long-term fleet deployment under market uncertainty and CII regulation. It is the first to integrate key operational uncertainties such as fuel prices, freight rates, and cargo demand into a unified tactical planning framework under CII regulation, simultaneously optimizing routing, cargo allocation, and speed. Furthermore, we develop an novel efficient heuristic algorithm that reliably converges to solutions within a 5\\% optimality gap, enabling practical decision-support under uncertainty. Numerical analysis highlights two key findings based on our model: (1) It uncovers the ``CII paradox,'' a critical counterintuitive phenomenon where the present Supply-based CII regulation may increase total emissions significantly and drastically reduce profits. This challenges the conventional wisdom that stricter carbon-intensity rules invariably reduce emissions. (2) It demonstrates the advantage of stochastic modeling, showing that accounting for future uncertainties significantly narrows the revenue gap with perfect-foresight solutions, thereby offering superior economic performance over deterministic approaches. Collectively, these results deepen the understanding of environmental regulation's operational impacts and pave the way for more effective and sustainable fleet management strategies."

Traditional detection relies on manual inspection with limited scalability. Machine/Deep Learning (M/DL) approaches automate detection but suffer from suboptimal precision, limited generalizability, and high retraining costs. This is because existing methods focus on topological structures rather than comprehensive semantic characteristics of Autonomous Systems (ASes), often misinterpreting functionally similar but topologically distant ASes. To address this, we propose BGPShield, an anomaly detection framework built on LLM embeddings that captures the Behavior Portrait and Routing Policy Rationale of each AS beyond topology, such as operational scale and global role. We propose a segment-wise aggregation scheme to transform AS descriptions into LLM representations without information loss, and a lightweight contrastive reduction network to compress them into a semantic-consistent version. Using these representations, our AR-DTW algorithm aligns and accumulates semantic distances to reveal behavioral inconsistencies. Evaluated on 16 real-world datasets, BGPShield detects 100% of verified anomalies with a false discovery rate below 5%. Notably, the employed LLMs were released prior to evaluation events, verifying generalizability. Furthermore, BGPShield constructs representations for unseen ASes within one second, significantly outperforming BEAM which demands costly retraining (averaging 65 hours)."

We present a robotic platform designed to overcome these challenges and demonstrate its potential in fetoscopic laser coagulation, a complex MIS procedure typically performed only by highly experienced surgeons. Our system combines a magnetically actuated flexible endoscope with teleoperated and semi-autonomous navigation capabilities for performing targeted laser ablations. To enhance surgical awareness, the platform reconstructs real-time mosaics of the endoscopic scene, providing an extended and continuous visual context. The ability of this system to address the key limitations of MIS in open spaces is validated in vivo in an ovine model."

While applying FL in cross-silo scenarios, where organizations collaborate, it is necessary that the FL system is reliable; however, participants can fail due to various reasons (e.g., communication issues or misconfigurations). In order to provide a reliable system, it is necessary to analyze the impact of participant failures. While this problem received attention in cross-device FL where mobile devices with limited resources participate, there is comparatively little research in cross-silo FL. Therefore, we conduct an extensive study for analyzing the impact of participant failures on the model quality in the context of inter-organizational cross-silo FL with few participants. In our study, we focus on analyzing generally influential factors such as the impact of the timing and the data as well as the impact on the evaluation, which is important for deciding, if the model should be deployed. We show that under high skews the evaluation is optimistic and hides the real impact. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the timing impacts the quality of the trained model. Our results offer insights for researchers and software architects aiming to build robust FL systems."

This enables efficient conditional sampling and straightforward estimation of conditional statistics through Monte Carlo methods. The model is trained via an objective function derived from a Kullback-Leibler formulation, without requiring invertibility or adversarial training.

    "abstract": "Adult language learning varies greatly among individuals. Traditionally associated with frontotemporal language regions, this variability is increasingly seen as stemming from distributed brain networks. However, the role of these networks and their topological organization in explaining these differences remains unclear. We hypothesize that graph-theory-based network analysis of intrinsic multimodal connectivities across multiple networks explains overall and component-specific variations in language learning. We tested this in 101 healthy adults who underwent resting-state fMRI, structural MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging before seven days of six artificial language training tasks. We identified one dominant general learning component shared across tasks and five task-specific ones. Cross-validated predictive models used multimodal multi-network graph-theoretic metrics to predict final learning outcomes (LO) and rates (LR). We significantly predicted the LO and LR of the general component, which were primarily contributed by dorsal attention and frontoparietal networks. Nodal local efficiency was the most consistent predictor, with additional contributions from node clustering coefficient and network centrality for LR, highlighting local robustness, mesoscale network segregation, and global influence in explaining individual differences. Only task-specific word learning LO was predictable, relying on default mode and frontoparietal hubs with high betweenness centrality and efficiency. These findings demonstrate that intrinsic network topologies underlie differences in language learning success, supporting a multiple-systems hypothesis in which attentional-control networks interact with default and subcortical systems to shape learning trajectories. This advances mechanistic understanding and paves the way for personalized language education."

Formal methods provide strong guarantees but depend on complete models and static assumptions. Runtime verification (RV) complements them by monitoring executions at run time and, in its predictive variants, by anticipating potential violations. Large language models (LLMs), meanwhile, excel at translating natural language into formal artefacts and recognising patterns in data, yet they remain error-prone and lack formal guarantees. This vision paper argues for a symbiotic integration of RV and LLMs. RV can serve as a guardrail for LLM-driven autonomy, while LLMs can extend RV by assisting specification capture, supporting anticipatory reasoning, and helping to handle uncertainty. We outline how this mutual reinforcement differs from existing surveys and roadmaps, discuss challenges and certification implications, and identify future research directions towards dependable autonomy."

In contrast, building on recent theoretical advances, we introduce here \\textsc{BiRNe} (BIfurcations in Reaction NEtworks) Python module, which relies on a symbolic approach designed to detect bifurcations in larger reaction networks (up to 10-20 species, depending on the network's connectivity) equipped with parameter-rich kinetics. This class includes enzymatic kinetics such as Michaelis--Menten, ligand-binding kinetics like Hill functions, and generalized mass-action kinetics. For a given network, the current algorithm identifies all minimal autocatalytic subnetworks and fully characterizes the presence of bifurcations associated with zero eigenvalues, thus determining whether the network admits multistationarity. It also detects oscillatory bifurcations arising from positive-feedback structures, capturing a significant class of possible oscillations."

Scene Graphs (SGs) allow for an explicit structured representation of objects present in a traffic scene and their spatial relationships to each other. In this paper, we build upon the SG construct and propose the Abstract Scene Graph (ASG) formalism to formalize spatial properties of ADFs. We show using real-world examples how spatial properties can be formalized using ASGs. Finally, we present a framework that uses ASGs to perform Runtime Monitoring of ADFs. To this end, we also show algorithmically how a spatial property formalized as an ASG can be satisfied by ADF system behaviour."

Solving such problems is computationally demanding because it requires repeatedly solving a PDE and using its solution within an optimization process. In this paper, we first propose a fully coherent quantum algorithm for solving PDE-constrained optimization problems. The proposed method combines a quantum PDE solver that prepares the solution vector as a quantum state, and a quantum optimizer that assumes oracle access to a quantized objective function. The central idea is the explicit construction of the oracle in a form of block-encoding for the objective function, which coherently uses the output of a quantum PDE solver. This enables us to avoid classical access to the full solution that requires quantum state tomography canceling out the potential quantum speedups. We also derive the overall computational complexity of the proposed method with respect to parameters for optimization and PDE simulation, where quantum speedup is inherited from the underlying quantum PDE solver. We numerically demonstrate the validity of the proposed method by applications, including a parameter calibration problem in the Black-Scholes equation and a material parameter design problem in the wave equation. This work presents the concept of composing quantum subroutines so that the weakness of one (i.e., prohibitive readout overhead) is neutralized by the strength of another (i.e., coherent oracle access), toward a bottleneck-free quantum algorithm."

Recently, we introduced ComplexEye, a multi-lens array microscope comprising 16 independent aberration-corrected glass lenses arranged at the pitch of a 96-well plate, capable of capturing high-resolution movies of migrating cells. This architecture enables high-throughput live-cell video microscopy for migration analysis, supporting routine quantification of autonomous motility with strong potential for clinical translation. However, ComplexEye and similar high-throughput imaging platforms generate data at an exponential rate, imposing substantial burdens on storage and transmission. To address this challenge, we present FlowRoI, a fast optical-flow-based region of interest (RoI) extraction framework designed for high-throughput image compression in immune cell migration studies. FlowRoI estimates optical flow between consecutive frames and derives RoI masks that reliably cover nearly all migrating cells. The raw image and its corresponding RoI mask are then jointly encoded using JPEG2000 to enable RoI-aware compression. FlowRoI operates with high computational efficiency, achieving runtimes comparable to standard JPEG2000 and reaching an average throughput of about 30 frames per second on a modern laptop equipped with an Intel i7-1255U CPU. In terms of image quality, FlowRoI yields higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) in cellular regions and achieves 2.0-2.2x higher compression rates at matched PSNR compared to standard JPEG2000."

We choose a tight-binding antiferromagnetic helix, where the strengths of magnetic moments at different lattice sites are non-uniform. The non-uniformity is introduced in two distinct forms, correlated and uncorrelated, and in each case we find a high degree of spin polarization. The Greens formalism is used to compute the results under various input conditions, and the results are valid for a broad range of physical parameters. Our analysis can open up a new direction of getting spin selectivity in different magnetic systems with zero net magnetization, in the absence of an electric field."

For the dynamic problem, only the case with a scaled Brownian motion reference process has been explored by Kato. Here, we derive large deviation results using the variational approach, with the aim of going beyond the Brownian reference dynamics considered by Kato. Specifically, we develop a uniform on compacts Laplace principle for bridge processes conditioned on their endpoints. When combined with existing results for the static problem, this leads to a large deviation principle for the corresponding (dynamic) Schrödinger bridge. In addition to the specific results of the paper, our work puts such large deviation questions into the weak convergence framework, and we conjecture that the results can be extended to cover also more involved types of reference dynamics. Specifically, we provide an outlook on applying the result to reflected Schrödinger bridges."

These challenges make conventional optimization and value-based RL approaches computationally inefficient and difficult to scale. This paper applies a Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) framework, instantiated through Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO), to enable coordinated restoration across interconnected microgrids. Each agent controls a distinct microgrid with different loads, DER capacities, and switch counts, introducing practical structural heterogeneity. Decentralized actor policies are trained with a centralized critic to compute advantage values for stable on-policy updates. A physics-informed OpenDSS environment provides full power flow feedback and enforces operational limits via differentiable penalty signals rather than invalid action masking. The total DER generation is capped at 2400 kW, and each microgrid must satisfy local supply-demand feasibility. Experiments on the IEEE 123-bus and IEEE 8500-node systems show that HAPPO achieves faster convergence, higher restored power, and smoother multi-seed training than DQN, PPO, MAES, MAGDPG, MADQN, Mean-Field RL, and QMIX. Results demonstrate that incorporating microgrid-level heterogeneity within the HARL framework yields a scalable, stable, and constraint-aware solution for complex PDS restoration."

This paper demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can dismantle these protective barriers by democratizing access to strategic expertise. Through empirical analysis of rent division scenarios on Spliddit algorithms, we show that users can obtain actionable manipulation strategies via simple conversational queries to AI assistants. We present four distinct manipulation scenarios: exclusionary collusion where majorities exploit minorities, defensive counterstrategies that backfire, benevolent subsidization of specific participants, and cost minimization coalitions. Our experiments reveal that LLMs can explain algorithmic mechanics, identify profitable deviations, and generate specific numerical inputs for coordinated preference misreporting--capabilities previously requiring deep technical knowledge. These findings extend algorithmic collective action theory from classification contexts to resource allocation scenarios, where coordinated preference manipulation replaces feature manipulation. The implications reach beyond rent division to any domain using algorithmic fairness mechanisms for resource division. While AI-enabled manipulation poses risks to system integrity, it also creates opportunities for preferential treatment of equity deserving groups. We argue that effective responses must combine algorithmic robustness, participatory design, and equitable access to AI capabilities, acknowledging that strategic sophistication is no longer a scarce resource."

This modular design is computationally inefficient, leads to suboptimal performance, and prevents the unification of diffusion with the single-network architectures common in vision foundation models. Our goal is to unify these three components into a single, end-to-end trainable network. We first demonstrate that a naive joint training approach fails catastrophically due to ``latent collapse'', where the diffusion training objective interferes with the network's ability to learn a good latent representation. We identify the root causes of this instability by drawing a novel analogy between diffusion and self-distillation based unsupervised learning method. Based on this insight, we propose Diffusion as Self-Distillation (DSD), a new framework with key modifications to the training objective that stabilize the latent space. This approach enables, for the first time, the stable end-to-end training of a single network that simultaneously learns to encode, decode, and perform diffusion. DSD achieves outstanding performance on the ImageNet $256\\times 256$ conditional generation task: FID=13.44/6.38/4.25 with only 42M/118M/205M parameters and 50 training epochs on ImageNet, without using classifier-free-guidance."

The TabPFN model, trained on 498 nuclei, accurately learns the relationship between the properties of the nuclear structure and $P_α$, achieving a root mean square deviation of $σ_{\\mathrm{rms}} = 0.211$. The predicted factors reveal clear odd-even staggering and shell closure effects, and exhibit a linear correlation with $Q_α^{-1/2}$, extending the Geiger-Nuttall systematics. When incorporated into CPPM calculations, the machine learning-based $P_α$ values significantly improve half-life predictions. The capability of the model is demonstrated through predictions for superheavy nuclei ($Z = 117$--120), suggesting $N = 184$ as a potential neutron magic number."

    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of myocardial scar from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) cardiac MRI is essential for evaluating tissue viability, yet remains challenging due to variable contrast and imaging artifacts. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide complementary physiological information, as conduction abnormalities can help localize or suggest scarred myocardial regions. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal framework that integrates ECG-derived electrophysiological information with anatomical priors from the AHA-17 atlas for physiologically consistent LGE-based scar segmentation. As ECGs and LGE-MRIs are not acquired simultaneously, we introduce a Temporal Aware Feature Fusion (TAFF) mechanism that dynamically weights and fuses features based on their acquisition time difference. Our method was evaluated on a clinical dataset and achieved substantial gains over the state-of-the-art image-only baseline (nnU-Net), increasing the average Dice score for scars from 0.6149 to 0.8463 and achieving high performance in both precision (0.9115) and sensitivity (0.9043). These results show that integrating physiological and anatomical knowledge allows the model to \"see beyond the image\", setting a new direction for robust and physiologically grounded cardiac scar segmentation."

This work advances the field by leveraging multimodal, multi-turn customer support dialogues, where users often share both textual complaints and visual evidence (e.g., screenshots, product photos) to enable fine-grained classification of complaint aspects and severity. We introduce VALOR, a Validation-Aware Learner with Expert Routing, tailored for this multimodal setting. It employs a multi-expert reasoning setup using large-scale generative models with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for nuanced decision-making. To ensure coherence between modalities, a semantic alignment score is computed and integrated into the final classification through a meta-fusion strategy. In alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), the proposed framework supports SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) by advancing AI-driven tools for robust, scalable, and context-aware service infrastructure. Further, by enabling structured analysis of complaint narratives and visual context, it contributes to SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) by promoting more responsive product design and improved accountability in consumer services. We evaluate VALOR on a curated multimodal complaint dataset annotated with fine-grained aspect and severity labels, showing that it consistently outperforms baseline models, especially in complex complaint scenarios where information is distributed across text and images. This study underscores the value of multimodal interaction and expert validation in practical complaint understanding systems.

In this paper, we present the massive runaway star HD~254577 as the pre-supernova binary companion to the progenitor of the supernova remnant IC~443 and the neutron star (NS) CXOU~J61705.3$+$222127. We performed spectroscopic observations of the runaway star and specified its atmospheric parameters. Together with the precise \\textit{Gaia} DR3 astrometry and photometry, we identified the possible birth origin of the runaway star, and by isochrone fitting, we determined the progenitor mass. From the \\textit{Gaia} DR3 proper motions, we specified the possible explosion sites and calculated the neutron star (NS) velocity. HD~254577 is a hot and evolved star with an effective temperature of $24000\\pm1000$ K (B0.5II) and a surface gravity of $\\log({g~\\rm[cm/s^2]})=2.75\\pm0.25$. It is probably a single star with a peculiar 3-D velocity of $31.3^{+1.2}_{-0.9}$ km~s$^{-1}$, lying at a heliocentric distance of $1701^{+55}_{-54}$ pc. The cometary tail of the NS implies that it is moving away from the same site as the runaway star. From the flight trajectories, we calculated that the NS has typical pulsar velocities such as $254-539$ km~s$^{-1}$ at a distance of $1.7$ kpc for $10-20$ kyr ages. Together with the blue-only shifted interstellar medium lines on its spectrum, HD~254577 must be the pre-supernova binary companion to the progenitor of IC~443. By identifying the pre-supernova companion and the possible parent cluster, we showed that the progenitor zero-age main sequence mass is high: $31-64$ M$_\\odot$.

However, these methods have only considered 2D reconstruction tasks and do not directly extend to 3D image reconstruction problems, such as in Computed Tomography (CT). To bridge this gap, we propose NEtwork-Regularized diffusion sampling for 3D CT (NERD) by incorporating an L1 regularization into the optimization objective. This regularizer encourages spatial continuity across adjacent slices, reducing inter-slice artifacts and promoting coherent volumetric reconstructions. Additionally, we introduce two efficient optimization strategies to solve the resulting objective: one based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and another based on the Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (PDHG) method. Experiments on medical 3D CT data demonstrate that our approach achieves either state-of-the-art or highly competitive results."

A few of papers have already investigated its accuracy in predicting different biomolecular structures. However, the potential applications of AF3 beyond basic structure prediction have not been fully explored. In our study, we firstly focused on structure predictions of antibody-antigen (CD47) complexes, which is believed to be challenge for AF3 due to limited resolved cognate crystallographic structures. Furtherly, we aimed to the potentiality of AF3 in performing pre-screening for potent antibody candidates as an auxiliary work through binding affinity analysis compared to other molecular docking modules of commercial software, which would greatly benefit the lead identification or optimization process in the drug development. In essence, this is not limited to antibody-antigen binding affinity, but many other chemical or physical properties of any drug candidate based on AF3's accurate predicting structures that are extremely close to the reality. According to our experimental results, AF3 is a very promising competitor, which can efficiently produce highly reliable molecular structures and subsequent binding energy predictions for most subjects. Surprisingly, an unexpected and nonrandom phenomenon \"reverse docking\" was observed for two of our antibody subjects, suggesting new issues arising from the architectural revolution of AF3. Our analysis and error correction experiments show that this phenomenon is likely to be caused by revolutionized AI model architectures, which provides important experience and reminders for the optimization and design direction of AI for structural prediction.

    "abstract": "Recent observations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies combined with large-scale structure may point towards higher values of the scalar spectral index, $n_s$. This puts previously preferred inflationary models, such as $α$-attractors, in tension with the new measurements. Pending a resolution of the tension between BAO parameters as determined by CMB datasets and those determined by DESI, we explore in this work the large-$n_s$ regime of $α$-attractor T-models. We show that some T-models can self-consistently produce an extended reheating stage with a stiff equation of state $(\\bar w>1/3)$, which allows values for $n_s$ closer to unity. We employ constraints from P-ACT-LB-BK18 data to illustrate what large-$n_s$ observations might imply for T-models. We show that the $n_s$ measurement yields an upper limit on $α$ that is stronger than the one from the tensor-to-scalar ratio only. We find that $n_s$ is maximised for $α\\sim1$, therefore the seven Poincaré models are well placed to deliver large $n_s$. However, the ability of a stiff reheating stage to increase the compatibility of T-models with large-$n_s$ measurements saturates as $\\bar{w}\\to1$. Thanks to this effect, we establish that the largest $n_s$ that T-models can produce is $n_s=0.9682$. T-models are therefore highly predictive in the large-$n_s$ regime and our result provides, under the assumption of perturbative reheating, a benchmark which could be used in the future to rule out T-models."

    "abstract": "Peptide-based drugs can bind to protein interaction sites that small molecules often cannot, and are easier to produce than large protein drugs. However, designing effective peptide binders is difficult. A typical peptide has an enormous number of possible sequences, and only a few of these will fold into the right 3D shape to match a given protein target. Existing computational methods either generate many candidate sequences without considering how they will fold, or build peptide backbones and then find suitable sequences afterward. Here we introduce ApexGen, a new AI-based framework that simultaneously designs a peptide's amino-acid sequence and its three-dimensional structure to fit a given protein target. For each target, ApexGen produces a full all-atom peptide model in a small number of deterministic integration steps. In tests on hundreds of protein targets, the peptides designed by ApexGen fit tightly onto their target surfaces and cover nearly the entire binding site. These peptides have shapes similar to those found in natural protein-peptide complexes, and they show strong predicted binding affinity in computational experiments. Because ApexGen couples sequence and structure design at every step of Euler integration within a flow-matching sampler, it is much faster and more efficient than prior approaches. This unified method could greatly accelerate the discovery of new peptide-based therapeutics."

We build M-CALLM, a framework that transforms multimodal sensor streams into hierarchical context for LLM-based prediction, and evaluate three paradigms (zero-shot prompting, few-shot learning, and supervised fine-tuning) against statistical baselines across intervention mode (real-time prediction) and simulation mode (autoregressive forecasting) Head-to-head comparison on 16 groups (64 participants, ~25 hours) demonstrates that context-aware LLMs achieve 96% accuracy for conversation prediction, a 3.2x improvement over LSTM baselines, while maintaining sub-35ms latency. However, simulation mode reveals brittleness with 83% degradation due to cascading errors. Deep-dive into modality-specific performance shows conversation depends on temporal patterns, proximity benefits from group structure (+6%), while shared attention fails completely (0% recall), exposing architectural limitations. We hope this work spawns new ideas for building intelligent collaborative sensing systems that balance semantic reasoning capabilities with fundamental constraints."

While traditional methods estimate the human in image coordinates, many applications require human motion to be estimated in world coordinates.

We address this with BEDLAM2.0, a new dataset that goes beyond the popular BEDLAM dataset in important ways. In addition to introducing more diverse and realistic cameras and camera motions, BEDLAM2.0 increases diversity and realism of body shape, motions, clothing, hair, and 3D environments. Additionally, it adds shoes, which were missing in BEDLAM. BEDLAM has become a key resource for training 3D human pose and motion regressors today and we show that BEDLAM2.0 is significantly better, particularly for training methods that estimate humans in world coordinates. We compare state-of-the art methods trained on BEDLAM and BEDLAM2.0, and find that BEDLAM2.0 significantly improves accuracy over BEDLAM.

    "abstract": "To distinguish Markov equivalent graphs in causal discovery, it is necessary to restrict the structural causal model. Crucially, we need to be able to distinguish cause $X$ from effect $Y$ in bivariate models, that is, distinguish the two graphs $X \\to Y$ and $Y \\to X$. Location-scale noise models (LSNMs), in which the effect $Y$ is modeled based on the cause $X$ as $Y = f(X) + g(X)N$, form a flexible class of models that is general and identifiable in most cases. Estimating these models for arbitrary noise terms $N$, however, is challenging. Therefore, practical estimators are typically restricted to symmetric distributions, such as the normal distribution. As we showcase in this paper, when $N$ is a skewed random variable, which is likely in real-world domains, the reliability of these approaches decreases. To approach this limitation, we propose SkewD, a likelihood-based algorithm for bivariate causal discovery under LSNMs with skewed noise distributions. SkewD extends the usual normal-distribution framework to the skew-normal setting, enabling reliable inference under symmetric and skewed noise. For parameter estimation, we employ a combination of a heuristic search and an expectation conditional maximization algorithm. We evaluate SkewD on novel synthetically generated datasets with skewed noise as well as established benchmark datasets. Throughout our experiments, SkewD exhibits a strong performance and, in comparison to prior work, remains robust under high skewness."

However, existing generative models typically confine the generative paradigm to the training phase, primarily for representation learning. During online inference, they revert to a standard discriminative paradigm, failing to leverage their powerful generative capabilities to further improve prediction accuracy. This fundamental asymmetry between the training and inference phases prevents the generative paradigm from realizing its full potential. To address this limitation, we propose the Symmetric Masked Generative Paradigm for CTR prediction (SGCTR), a novel framework that establishes symmetry between the training and inference phases. Specifically, after acquiring generative capabilities by learning feature dependencies during training, SGCTR applies the generative capabilities during online inference to iteratively redefine the features of input samples, which mitigates the impact of noisy features and enhances prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of SGCTR, demonstrating that applying the generative paradigm symmetrically across both training and inference significantly unlocks its power in CTR prediction."

    "abstract": "A key challenge in Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is to continually learn under shifting distributions while preserving knowledge from previous domains. Existing methods face a fundamental dilemma. On one hand, projecting all domains into a single unified visual space leads to inter-domain interference and semantic distortion, as large shifts may vary with not only visual appearance but also underlying semantics. On the other hand, isolating domain-specific parameters causes knowledge fragmentation, creating \"knowledge islands\" that hamper knowledge reuse and exacerbate forgetting. To address this issue, we propose LAVA (Language-Anchored Visual Alignment), a novel DIL framework that replaces direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by a text-based reference anchor. LAVA guides the visual representations of each incoming domain to preserve a consistent relative geometry, which is defined by mirroring the pairwise semantic similarities between the class names. This anchored geometric structure acts as a bridge across domains, enabling the retrieval of class-aware prior knowledge and facilitating robust feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on standard DIL benchmarks demonstrate that LAVA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/ShuyiGeng/LAVA."

    "abstract": "We derive an explicit analytic expression for the first quantum correction to the second virial coefficient of a $d$-dimensional fluid whose particles interact via the generalized Lennard-Jones $(2n,n)$ potential. By introducing an appropriate change of variable, the correction term is reduced to a single integral that can be evaluated in closed form in terms of parabolic cylinder or generalized Hermite functions. The resulting expression compactly incorporates both dimensionality and stiffness, providing direct access to the low- and high-temperature asymptotic regimes. In the special case of the standard Lennard-Jones fluid ($d=3$, $n=6$), the formula obtained is considerably more compact than previously reported representations based on hypergeometric functions. The knowledge of this correction allows us to determine the first quantum contribution to the Boyle temperature, whose dependence on dimensionality and stiffness is explicitly analyzed. Moreover, the same methodology can be systematically extended to obtain higher-order quantum corrections."

    "abstract": "Language-conditioned manipulation facilitates human-robot interaction via behavioral cloning (BC), which learns control policies from human demonstrations and serves as a cornerstone of embodied AI. Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states."

For protons, both $N_g$ and $S$ rise toward small $x$ yet stay below $1/α_s$ in our baseline setup. For nuclei, by contrast, the nuclear entropy $S_A$ attains the $1/α_s$ benchmark in a small-$x$ window where the proton does not. This singles out nuclei as the natural environment to search for saturon-like behavior and motivates precision small-$x$ measurements and high-occupancy $pA$ and $AA$ collisions."

This paper introduces a novel mitigation strategy discovered through training multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents in a simulated ring-road environment. The agents autonomously develop a cooperative driving policy, where most vehicles maintain minimal headways to maximize throughput, while a single \"buffer\" vehicle adopts a larger headway to absorb perturbations and prevent wave propagation. This strategy enhances stability without sacrificing overall flow. We further demonstrate that adapting this cooperative strategy to classical car-following models, such as the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), yields improved stability and traffic efficiency. Furthermore, we show within a parametrised linear framework, that the cooperative strategy can optimise system performance under stability constraints. Our findings offer promising insights for future autonomous vehicle systems and highway management."

We begin by summarizing the magnetic field configurations that enable prominence support, followed by a classification of four representative plasma formation mechanisms: injection, levitation, evaporation--condensation, and in-situ condensation. Each mechanism is analyzed in terms of its physical basis, numerical realizations, and observational diagnostics. A central focus is placed on the evaporation--condensation scenario, which has seen significant development over the past decade through numerical simulations. We also discuss recent progress in modeling in-situ condensation triggered by magnetic reconnection and levitation dynamics. Throughout, we emphasize the complementary nature of different mechanisms and their potential coexistence in forming and maintaining prominence mass. Observational constraints and recent high-resolution data are reviewed to assess the physical plausibility of each mechanism. We conclude by highlighting open questions and future directions in connecting multi-scale physical processes to the observed diversity of prominence behaviors."

    "abstract": "Infrared unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) target images often suffer from motion blur degradation caused by rapid sensor movement, significantly reducing contrast between target and background. Generally, detection performance heavily depends on the discriminative feature representation between target and background. Existing methods typically treat deblurring as a preprocessing step focused on visual quality, while neglecting the enhancement of task-relevant features crucial for detection. Improving feature representation for detection under blur conditions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel Joint Feature-Domain Deblurring and Detection end-to-end framework, dubbed JFD3. We design a dual-branch architecture with shared weights, where the clear branch guides the blurred branch to enhance discriminative feature representation. Specifically, we first introduce a lightweight feature restoration network, where features from the clear branch serve as feature-level supervision to guide the blurred branch, thereby enhancing its distinctive capability for detection. We then propose a frequency structure guidance module that refines the structure prior from the restoration network and integrates it into shallow detection layers to enrich target structural information. Finally, a feature consistency self-supervised loss is imposed between the dual-branch detection backbones, driving the blurred branch to approximate the feature representations of the clear one. Wealso construct a benchmark, named IRBlurUAV, containing 30,000 simulated and 4,118 real infrared UAV target images with diverse motion blur. Extensive experiments on IRBlurUAV demonstrate that JFD3 achieves superior detection performance while maintaining real-time efficiency."

To address these challenges, we introduce ATLAS (AGI-Oriented Testbed for Logical Application in Science), a large-scale, high-difficulty, and cross-disciplinary evaluation suite composed of approximately 800 original problems. Developed by domain experts (PhD-level and above), ATLAS spans seven core scientific fields: mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, earth science, and materials science. Its key features include: (1) High Originality and Contamination Resistance, with all questions newly created or substantially adapted to prevent test data leakage; (2) Cross-Disciplinary Focus, designed to assess models' ability to integrate knowledge and reason across scientific domains; (3) High-Fidelity Answers, prioritizing complex, open-ended answers involving multi-step reasoning and LaTeX-formatted expressions over simple multiple-choice questions; and (4) Rigorous Quality Control, employing a multi-stage process of expert peer review and adversarial testing to ensure question difficulty, scientific value, and correctness. We also propose a robust evaluation paradigm using a panel of LLM judges for automated, nuanced assessment of complex answers. Preliminary results on leading models demonstrate ATLAS's effectiveness in differentiating their advanced scientific reasoning capabilities. We plan to develop ATLAS into a long-term, open, community-driven platform to provide a reliable \"ruler\" for progress toward Artificial General Intelligence."

We analyse the proper motions of the clusters, which have been measured based on multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. Additionally, we infer from the HST data homogeneous and robust estimates for the distances, ages and metallicities of the clusters. This collection of information, in combination with literature line-of-sight velocities, allows us to investigate the full 3D dynamics of our sample of clusters within the frame of the LMC in a self-consistent way. While most young clusters orbit the LMC close to the stellar disc plane, NGC 1850 (~100 Myr old) depicts a peculiar case. Depending on the exact distance from the disc, it follows either a highly inclined, retrograde orbit or an eccentric orbit along the bar structure. The orbits of young clusters that formed North of the LMC centre show signs that might be connected to the resettling motion of the LMC bar structure. Based on the dynamic properties in combination with the positions of the clusters in the age-metallicity space, we find no clear-cut evidence for clusters in our sample that could have been stripped from the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) onto the LMC. We finally compare the kinematics of the intermediate-age clusters with a suite of simple numerical simulations of the Magellanic system to interpret the cluster motions. A possible interaction history of the LMC with the SMC, where the SMC had two past crossings of the LMC disc plane (about 300 and 900 Myr ago), in combination with the recent SMC pericentre passage, can qualitatively explain the observed kinematic structure of the clusters analysed in this work."

In this work, we introduce a controlled violation of this principle by inserting a parametric controlled-unitary gate that enables a tunable leakage of quantum information from the black hole interior to the exterior, while preserving global unitarity. By varying the deformation parameter, we study the evolution of entanglement entropy, mutual information, and entanglement negativity throughout the evaporation process. While the semi-causal case yields a Page-like entropy curve with vanishing late-time correlations, we find that even small violations of semi-causality produce a non-zero residual entropy and persistent negativity across the horizon. These features mimic quantum-gravity-induced effects such as remnant formation and horizon permeability, suggesting that minimal deviations from classical causality can leave long-lived imprints on black hole information dynamics."

I conclude that in the thermodynamic limit, the diverging component is indeed present, although the crossover to a regime dominated by the anomalous component may occur at extremely long system sizes. Finally, I study a variant of the ding-a-ling model, previously claimed to satisfy Fourier law, showing that it too exhibits a diverging conductivity in the thermodynamic limit."

Unlike the continuous fundamental solution used in boundary integral methods, the LGF introduces no singularity, which simplifies numerical implementation. Boundary conditions are incorporated through local Lagrange interpolation on unfitted cut cells. The resulting method retains key advantages of boundary integral approaches-including dimension reduction and the absence of artificial boundary conditions--while enabling finite differences for complex geometries. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the method for various scatterers, including circular, triangular, and multiple-body configurations."

The developed algorithm leverages either pre-fault or fault-time data to construct input-output predictors, yielding offset-free control without the need for physics-based modelling. Simulation results show that pre-fault offset-free DPC doubles the critical equivalent grid impedance that can be handled and reduces the root mean squared error during faults by a factor of 40, while maintaining computation times comparable to conventional PI control. These findings demonstrate that the developed offset-free data predictive controller offers a simple, robust, and computationally efficient alternative to conventional control, significantly enhancing fault-ride-through capabilities of converters in weak grids."

However, existing deep-learning approaches rely heavily on modality-specific training, large annotated datasets, and controlled scanning conditions, which limit generalization across devices and hinder deployment in real clinical workflows. Moreover, raw intraoral meshes exhibit substantial variation in arch pose, incomplete geometry caused by occlusion or tooth contact, and a lack of texture cues, making unified semantic interpretation highly challenging. To address these limitations, we propose ArchMap, a training-free and knowledge-guided framework for robust structured dental understanding. ArchMap first introduces a geometry-aware arch-flattening module that standardizes raw 3D meshes into spatially aligned, continuity-preserving multi-view projections. We then construct a Dental Knowledge Base (DKB) encoding hierarchical tooth ontology, dentition-stage policies, and clinical semantics to constrain the symbolic reasoning space. We validate ArchMap on 1060 pre-/post-orthodontic cases, demonstrating robust performance in tooth counting, anatomical partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and the identification of clinical conditions such as crowding, missing teeth, prosthetics, and caries. Compared with supervised pipelines and prompted VLM baselines, ArchMap achieves higher accuracy, reduced semantic drift, and superior stability under sparse or artifact-prone conditions. As a fully training-free system, ArchMap demonstrates that combining geometric normalization with ontology-guided multimodal reasoning offers a practical and scalable solution for the structured analysis of 3D intraoral scans in modern digital orthodontics."

Large language models appear to bring this vision closer, showing impressive results in automatically generating models for classical benchmarks. However, much of this apparent success may derive from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning: many standard CP problems are likely included in the training data of these models. To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements. We then compared the models produced by three representative LLMs across original and modified descriptions. Our qualitative analysis shows that while LLMs can produce syntactically valid and semantically plausible models, their performance drops sharply under contextual and linguistic variation, revealing shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording."

We study how differences in colour ($c$), stretch ($x_{1}$), and host galaxy properties-stellar mass ($M$) and specific star formation rate (sSFR)-between calibration and Hubble Flow (HF) Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) samples used by SH0ES affect SN luminosity standardization and $H_{0}$ estimates. We generate subsamples from both, estimating $H_{0}$, $M_{B}$, $α$, $β$, $Δ_{host}$, and $σ_{int}$. We use Kolmogorov-Smirnov to assess the consistency between subsamples and reveal how parameter estimates change as sample matching improves. The calibration sample is not fully representative of the HF sample, especially in $M$ and sSFR. Improving sample consistency leads to changes in $H_{0}$, $M_{B}$, $α$, and $σ_{int}$, though overall values remain broadly stable. Better-matched subsamples tend to yield a mass step consistent with zero within 1$σ$. By disentangling SN subpopulations, we find persistent differences in $H_{0}$ ($\\sim$2-3$σ$) and $M_{B}$ ($\\sim2σ$) between low- and high-stretch SNe: $H_{0} = 75.27 \\pm 1.18$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for low-stretch and $H_{0} = 71.25 \\pm 1.59$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for high-stretch, resulting in Hubble tensions of 6.07$σ$ and 2.52$σ$. These differences suggest SNe Ia subpopulations with varying dust and intrinsic colour not captured by a single $β$, impacting cosmology. Estimating a single $H_{0}$ for both subpopulations yields $H_{0} = 73.78 \\pm 2.17$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, with a much larger uncertainty that lowers the Hubble tension from $5.87σ$ to $\\sim2.86σ$. Our results suggest that the mass step may arise from an over-correction of more than one SN subpopulation associated to different environments."

    "abstract": "Understanding the physical interaction with wearable robots is essential to ensure safety and comfort. However, this interaction is complex in two key aspects: (1) the motion involved, and (2) the non-linear behaviour of soft tissues. Multiple approaches have been undertaken to better understand this interaction and to improve the quantitative metrics of physical interfaces or cuffs. As these two topics are closely interrelated, finite modelling and soft tissue characterisation offer valuable insights into pressure distribution and shear stress induced by the cuff. Nevertheless, current characterisation methods typically rely on a single fitting variable along one degree of freedom, which limits their applicability, given that interactions with wearable robots often involve multiple degrees of freedom. To address this limitation, this work introduces a dual-variable characterisation method, involving normal and tangential forces, aimed at identifying reliable material parameters and evaluating the impact of single-variable fitting on force and torque responses. This method demonstrates the importance of incorporating two variables into the characterisation process by analysing the normalized mean square error (NMSE) across different scenarios and material models, providing a foundation for simulation at the closest possible level, with a focus on the cuff and the human limb involved in the physical interaction between the user and the wearable robot."

    "abstract": "In clinical machine learning, the coexistence of multiple models with comparable performance -- a manifestation of the Rashomon Effect -- poses fundamental challenges for trustworthy deployment and evaluation. Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using these tools facilitates the selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings."

    "abstract": "Intraoral 3D reconstruction is fundamental to digital orthodontics, yet conventional methods like intraoral scanning are inaccessible for remote tele-orthodontics, which typically relies on sparse smartphone imagery. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for novel view synthesis, its application to the standard clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photographs is challenging. The large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces common in intraoral settings can destabilize simultaneous pose and geometry estimation. Furthermore, sparse-view photometric supervision often induces a frequency bias, leading to over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Dental3R}, a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust, high-fidelity reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs. Our method first constructs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs. The GAPS focuses on correspondence matching, thereby improving the stability of the geometry initialization and reducing memory usage. Building on the recovered poses and point cloud, we train the 3DGS model with a wavelet-regularized objective. By enforcing band-limited fidelity using a discrete wavelet transform, our approach preserves fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases. Experimental results demonstrate that Dental3R effectively handles sparse, unposed inputs and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods."

Designing battery swapping and charging networks that are cost-efficient, grid-compatible, and sustainable is therefore a pressing yet complex challenge: service providers must jointly optimize station locations, battery inventory, and grid interaction under high-dimensional uncertainty. We develop an integrated location-inventory-grid model and employ a continuous approximation approach to overcome the intractability of discrete formulations. Our analysis compares centralized versus decentralized charging, with and without participation in frequency regulation. The results reveal that centralized charging, when combined with frequency regulation, not only reduces cost but also strengthens grid stability. However, it may constrain operational flexibility near the optimum, potentially challenging efforts to mitigate environmental impacts by lowering battery inventories. These results offer actionable guidance for cost-efficient, environmentally sustainable, and grid-compatible scaling of urban EV infrastructure to meet the demands of large-scale EV adoption."

Applying the result on the signed projective cube $SPC(2k-1)$, we conclude that every signed bipartite graph of negative girth at least $2k$ whose underlying graph is a partial 3-tree admits a homomorphism to $SPC(2k-1)$. For planar partial 3-trees, applying duality we conclude that if $G$ is a planar $2k$-regular multigraph whose dual has treewidth at most 3 and such that every edge-cut $(X, V\\backslash X)$, where $|X|$ is odd, has size at least $2k$, then $G$ is $2k$-edge-colorable. This supports a conjecture of Seymour which, in full generality, largely extends Tait's reformulation of the four-color theorem, claiming that the fractional edge-chromatic number of a planar multigraph determines its edge-chromatic number. Finally, noting the contrast between fractional isomorphism and quantum isomorphism, where the former admits a polynomial time algorithm while the latter is proved to be undecidable, and observing the similarities of these notions to the subject of our study, we ask if there is an algorithm to decide if an input signed graph $\\widehat{B}$ has the following property: if a signed planar graph $\\widehat{G}$ does not map to $\\widehat{B}$, it would be because a cycle in $\\widehat{G}$ does not map to $\\widehat{B}$. In other words, minimal planar graphs that do not map to $\\widehat{B}$ are signed cycles."

Like any projection method, their outcomes are inherently uncertain and sensitive to multiple factors. However, such factors are rarely addressed. Applying variance-based sensitivity analysis to both direct and indirect effects within the employment module of the MikroSim model for Germany, we show that commonly considered sources of uncertainty, namely coefficient and parameter uncertainty, are less influential than qualitative modeling choices. Because dynamic microsimulations are inherently complex and are computationally intensive, it is crucial to consider potential factors of uncertainty and their influence on simulation outputs in order to more carefully design simulation setups and better communicate results. We find, that simple summary measures insufficiently capture overall model uncertainty and urge modelers to account for these broader sources when designing microsimulations and their results."

These lines are detectable in metal-rich and, in contrast to atomic C lines, also in metal-poor late-type stars. However, only 3D LTE analyses of the CH lines have been performed so far. Aims. We test the formation of CH lines in the solar spectrum, using for the first time, 3D Non-LTE (NLTE) models. We also aim to derive the solar photospheric abundance of C, using the diagnostic transitions in the optical (4218 - 4356 Å) and infrared (33025 - 37944 Å). Methods. We use the updated NLTE model molecule from Popa et al. (2023) and different solar 3D radiation-hydrodynamics model atmospheres. The models are contrasted against new spatially-resolved optical solar spectra, and the center-to-limb variation (CLV) of CH lines is studied. Results. The 1D LTE and 1D NLTE models fail to describe the line CLV, and lead to underestimated solar C abundances. The 3D NLTE modelling of diagnostic lines in the optical and IR yields a carbon abundance of A(C)=$8.52\\pm0.07$ dex. The estimate is in agreement with recent results based on neutrino fluxes measured by Borexino. Conclusions. 3D NLTE modelling and tests on spatially-resolved solar data are essential to derive robust solar abundances. The analysis presented here focuses on CH, but we expect that similar effects will be present for other molecules of astrophysical interest."

This paper develops a decision-making model integrating system dynamics with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (NSGA-II) to balance economic returns, environmental protection, and social satisfaction. We collect multi-source data from 2008-2024 including visitor arrivals (up to 3.1M), government revenue/expenditure (up to $10.3M), glacier retreat (220-350 ft), CO2 emissions (77K-105K tons), and social satisfaction (0.29-0.48), and establish a dynamic system with four modules: tourist behavior, government finance, environmental evolution, and social well-being. We optimize three objectives via NSGA-II: cumulative net revenue, final environmental index, and final social satisfaction. Experiments on Juneau show optimal solutions yield net revenue up to $1.64B with environmental index 0.93 and social satisfaction 0.86. Extending to Iceland reveals Pareto fronts spanning revenues $150M-$200M, environment indices up to 0.92, and social satisfaction above 0.80. Sobol and Morris sensitivity analyses indicate carbon fees and price elasticity account for over 60% of environmental outcome variance, while capacity limits explain around 90% of net revenue variability. Scenario simulations demonstrate how capacity limits and dynamic pricing on crowded attractions, combined with marketing and infrastructure investment in lesser-known sites, mitigate congestion and enhance sustainability. This work contributes: (i) an integrated system-dynamics and NSGA-II framework for sustainable tourism management; (ii) demonstrated portability via case studies on Juneau and Iceland; and (iii) global sensitivity analysis highlighting influential policy levers for decision makers."

Here, we propose a scalable architecture for producing correlated few-photon entangled states via cascaded inelastic scattering in a nonlinear waveguide. When a single photon scatters off a far detuned excited two-level emitter, it coherently converts into a propagating doublon, a bound photon pair with anomalous dispersion. This doublon can subsequently scatter off a downstream excited emitter to further convert into a triplon, and so on, thereby establishing a photon-number amplification cascade $|\\cdot \\rangle \\!\\! \\rightarrow \\!\\! |\\!\\!: \\rangle \\!\\! \\rightarrow \\! \\! |\\!\\!\\therefore \\rangle \\!\\! \\to \\!\\! ...$ Central to this process is the concept of a pseudo-giant atom, which we introduce here to capture the non-local scattering potential emergent from the wave functions of bound states. By implementing this scheme using a real giant atom with multiple engineered coupling points, we achieve unidirectional and full controllable photon conversion without backscattering. The resulting output state forms a programmable superposition of spatially and temporally isolated photon-number components, automatically sorted by their distinct group velocities. This work opens a new paradigm in quantum state engineering, enabling on-demand generation of complex multi-photon resources for quantum simulation, metrology, and scalable quantum networks."

In this work, we introduce spatial regret, a graph-informed metric that measures the worst-case performance gap between a distributed controller and an oracle which is assumed to have access to additional sensor information. The oracle's graph is a user-specified augmentation of the available information graph, resulting in a benchmark policy that highlights disturbances for which additional sensor information would significantly improve performance. Minimizing spatial regret yields distributed controllers-respecting the nominal information graph-that emulate the oracle's response to disturbances that are characteristic of large-scale networks, such as localized perturbations. We show that minimizing spatial regret admits a convex reformulation as an infinite program with a finite-dimensional approximation. To scale to large networks, we derive a computable upper bound on the spatial regret metric whose minimization problem can be solved in a distributed way. Numerical experiments on power-system models demonstrate that the resulting controllers mitigate localized disturbances more effectively than controllers optimized using classical metrics."

We prove well-posedness and stability of the flow, and that, in the long term, the energy always converges to its minimal value. The analysis is based on a change of variable to study the flow in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, in which the evolution is no longer a gradient flow but described by a monotone operator. Under a restrictive assumption we prove the convergence of our modified JKO scheme towards this flow as the time step vanishes. We also provide numerical illustrations of the intriguing properties of this newly defined gradient flow."

    "abstract": "Collagen fibrils are the building block of many biological tissues, which viability depend on the fibrils properties. Altered properties of collagen fibrils are central to the appearance of many diseases, and physiological or native properties must be reproduced for tissue engineering. Yet, the self-assembly, the structure, and therefore the properties of collagen fibrils remain elusive. One main reason is the extreme sensitivity of the fibrils to their environmental conditions, and in particular hydration which is only loosely bound by experimental measurements. Furthermore, mechanics are an integral part of the self-assembly process and may result in internal stresses in collagen fibrils in native conditions. Here, we propose to investigate internal stresses in collagen fibrils by means of molecular dynamics simulations of the collagen microfibril model. Our simulations reveal the quantitative evolution of internal stresses in collagen fibrils with hydration. We establish a value of native hydration of collagen fibrils at 0.78 g/g based on an absence of cross-sectional stresses. In turn, we determine a quantitative estimate of internal longitudinal stresses in collagen fibrils in native conditions of 210 MPa. We find that internal longitudinal stresses are caused by an over-extended protein backbone rather than partial hydration, which appears remnant of the local forces driving collagen self-assembly. We also demonstrate the consequences of internal longitudinal stresses on the mechanical properties of collagen fibrils, which the absence of induces more than a 20% decrease in the Young's modulus. Overall, our findings provide insights into the native structure and properties of collagen fibrils. More than ever, collagen fibrils appear to be assembled via an out-of-equilibrium process key for the synthesis of viable tissues."

    "abstract": "The automatic movie dubbing model generates vivid speech from given scripts, replicating a speaker's timbre from a brief timbre prompt while ensuring lip-sync with the silent video. Existing approaches simulate a simplified workflow where actors dub directly without preparation, overlooking the critical director-actor interaction. In contrast, authentic workflows involve a dynamic collaboration: directors actively engage with actors, guiding them to internalize the context cues, specifically emotion, before performance. To address this issue, we propose a new Retrieve-Augmented Director-Actor Interaction Learning scheme to achieve authentic movie dubbing, termed Authentic-Dubber, which contains three novel mechanisms: (1) We construct a multimodal Reference Footage library to simulate the learning footage provided by directors. Note that we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve deep comprehension of emotional representations across multimodal signals. (2) To emulate how actors efficiently and comprehensively internalize director-provided footage during dubbing, we propose an Emotion-Similarity-based Retrieval-Augmentation strategy. This strategy retrieves the most relevant multimodal information that aligns with the target silent video. (3) We develop a Progressive Graph-based speech generation approach that incrementally incorporates the retrieved multimodal emotional knowledge, thereby simulating the actor's final dubbing process. The above mechanisms enable the Authentic-Dubber to faithfully replicate the authentic dubbing workflow, achieving comprehensive improvements in emotional expressiveness. Both subjective and objective evaluations on the V2C Animation benchmark dataset validate the effectiveness. The code and demos are available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/Authentic-Dubber."

We address this by constructing a large, music-related natural language corpus (40B tokens) that combines open source and in-house data, and by implementing a domain-first data pipeline: a lightweight classifier filters and weights in-domain text, followed by multi-stage cleaning, de-duplication, and privacy-preserving masking. We further integrate multi-source music text with associated metadata to form a broader, better-structured foundation of domain knowledge. On the training side, we introduce reference-model (RM)-based token-level soft scoring for quality control: a unified loss-ratio criterion is used both for data selection and for dynamic down-weighting during optimization, reducing noise gradients and amplifying task-aligned signals, thereby enabling more effective music-domain continued pretraining and alignment. To assess factuality, we design the MusicSimpleQA benchmark, which adopts short, single-answer prompts with automated agreement scoring. Beyond the benchmark design, we conduct systematic comparisons along the axes of data composition. Overall, this work advances both the right corpus and the right objective, offering a scalable data-training framework and a reusable evaluation tool for building domain LLMs in the music field."

    "abstract": "Magnetic topology is central to modern quantum magnet, where spin chirality governs exotic spin winding, real-space Berry phase, and topological Hall effect. A key unresolved challenge is how to electrically switch topological spin chirality and its associated gauge flux, an essential requirement for manipulating its topological quantum properties. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the concept of current-switching spin chirality. We identify the new vdW antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2 as an ideal platform, hosting a topological 3Q state with a minimum chirality cell, an ultrahigh skyrmion density, a non-centrosymmetric geometry, and a strong Berry curvature. Using a Co1/3TaS2/Pt heterostructure, we achieve the nonvolatile and reversible switching by current via current-driven spin-orbit torque based on Pts spin Hall effect. Beyond this conventional route, we further discover intrinsic self-torque-induced chirality switching within Co1/3TaS2, driven purely by current, without a magnetic field, and with high energy efficiency. These complementary pathways establish a unified framework for electrically creating and controlling spin chirality. Our results demonstrate a practical route toward chiral spintronics. They can be naturally generalised to other skyrmion systems, offering new opportunities in symmetry control, topological manipulation, and spin-chirality-based quantum functionalities."

To address these limitations, we propose a novel autoregressive diffusion model that processes input audio in a streaming manner. This design ensures flexibility with varying audio lengths and achieves low latency independent of audio duration. Specifically, we select a limited number of past frames as historical motion context and combine them with the audio input to create a dynamic condition. This condition guides the diffusion process to iteratively generate facial motion frames, enabling real-time synthesis with high-quality results. Additionally, we implemented a real-time interactive demo, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. We will release the code at https://zju3dv.github.io/StreamingTalker/."

However, it also suffers from large variance and path degeneracy which prevent it from scaling well with increased search depth, i.e., increased sequential compute. To address these problems, we introduce Twice Sequential Monte Carlo Tree Search (TSMCTS). Across discrete and continuous environments TSMCTS outperforms the SMC baseline as well as a popular modern version of MCTS. Through variance reduction and mitigation of path degeneracy, TSMCTS scales favorably with sequential compute while retaining the properties that make SMC natural to parallelize."

    "abstract": "The Whisper model, an open-source automatic speech recognition system, is widely adopted for its strong performance across multilingual and zero-shot settings. However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions."

Online data curation extends this idea by dynamically selecting training samples based on the model's evolving state. While effective in classification and multimodal learning, existing online sampling strategies rarely extend to object detection because of its structural complexity and domain gaps. We introduce DetGain, an online data curation method specifically for object detection that estimates the marginal perturbation of each image to dataset-level Average Precision (AP) based on its prediction quality. By modeling global score distributions, DetGain efficiently estimates the global AP change and computes teacher-student contribution gaps to select informative samples at each iteration. The method is architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive, enabling straightforward integration into diverse object detection architectures. Experiments on the COCO dataset with multiple representative detectors show consistent improvements in accuracy. DetGain also demonstrates strong robustness under low-quality data and can be effectively combined with knowledge distillation techniques to further enhance performance, highlighting its potential as a general and complementary strategy for data-efficient object detection."

The platform allowed achieving sufficiently effective gain for amplified spontaneous emission at a threshold as low as 1.8 kW/cm2 under quasi-CW pumping, even at a con-centration two orders of magnitude lower than the minimal concentration considered to be required for gain in conventional colloidal quantum dots. We show that the low-loss optical waveguiding of the fiber is crucial for efficient stimulated emission, rendering liquid-core fibers as a promising and unique platform to realize lasers based on colloidally dispersed nanocrystals."

We examine the behavior of MA-EUR when the memory qubit undergoes noisy dynamics implemented via high-order controlled processes, namely, the quantum switch and the quantum time-flip. We consider a setting in which the control qubit is the very system on which the measurements are performed, while the target qubit serves as a noisy quantum memory. Focusing on Pauli channels, we show that feeding them into the quantum switch and the quantum time-flip can significantly reduce the total entropic uncertainty as compared to their direct application. Our results reveal that indefinite causal order and input-output direction can serve as resources to mitigate the effects of noise in the context of MA-EUR and its applications."

In this work, the concept of \"temporal taper\", the temporal counterpart of a conventional spatial taper with a nearly full-band antireflection feature and good compatibility with gradual time-varying components, has been experimentally realized. A 1D temporal metamaterial base on voltage-controlled varactors has been designed experimentally validated. The temporal taper based broadband antireflection exempts the system from spatial matching insertions, and enables agile impedance matching for various terminal loads, positioning it as a promising approach in future photonic systems."

This task is particularly challenging due to rapid succession, motion blur, and subtle visual differences. Consequently, most existing methods rely on domain-specific, end-to-end training with large labeled datasets and often struggle in few-shot conditions due to their dependence on pixel- or pose-based inputs alone. However, obtaining large labeled datasets is practically hard. We propose a Unified Multi-Entity Graph Network (UMEG-Net) for few-shot PES. UMEG-Net integrates human skeletons and sport-specific object keypoints into a unified graph and features an efficient spatio-temporal extraction module based on advanced GCN and multi-scale temporal shift. To further enhance performance, we employ multimodal distillation to transfer knowledge from keypoint-based graphs to visual representations. Our approach achieves robust performance with limited labeled data and significantly outperforms baseline models in few-shot settings, providing a scalable and effective solution for few-shot PES.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential for enhancing EL performance. Prior research has leveraged LLMs to improve entity disambiguation and input representation, yielding significant gains in accuracy and robustness. However, these approaches typically apply LLMs to isolated stages of the EL task, failing to fully integrate their capabilities throughout the entire process. In this work, we introduce DeepEL, a comprehensive framework that incorporates LLMs into every stage of the entity linking task. Furthermore, we identify that disambiguating entities in isolation is insufficient for optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel self-validation mechanism that utilizes global contextual information, enabling LLMs to rectify their own predictions and better recognize cohesive relationships among entities within the same sentence. Extensive empirical evaluation across ten benchmark datasets demonstrates that DeepEL substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.6\\% in overall F1 score and a remarkable 4% gain on out-of-domain datasets.

Persisting these objects is critical, not only to enhance system robustness against unexpected failures but also to support continuous, non-linear data exploration via versioning. Existing object persistence mechanisms (e.g., Pickle, Dill) rely on complete snapshotting, often redundantly storing unchanged objects during execution and exploration, resulting in significant inefficiency in both time and storage. Unlike DBMSs, data science systems lack centralized buffer managers that track dirty objects. Worse, object states span various locations such as memory heaps, shared memory, GPUs, and remote machines, making dirty object identification fundamentally more challenging. In this work, we propose a graph-based object store, named Chipmink, that acts like the centralized buffer manager. Unlike static pages in DBMSs, persistence units in Chipmink are dynamically induced by partitioning objects into appropriate subgroups (called pods), minimizing expected persistence costs based on object sizes and reference structure. These pods effectively isolate dirty objects, enabling efficient partial persistence. Our experiments show that Chipmink is general, supporting libraries that rely on shared memory, GPUs, and remote objects. Moreover, Chipmink achieves up to 36.5x smaller storage sizes and 12.4x faster persistence than the best baselines in real-world notebooks and scripts."

    "abstract": "We study a class of stochastic resetting (SR) processes in which a diffusing particle alternates between free motion and confinement by an externally controlled potential. When the particle is recaptured, it undergoes a return trajectory that drives it toward a designated reset point. In standard SR, such returns are treated as instantaneous, but in realistic setups they have finite duration and introduce imprecision in the starting points of subsequent search attempts. We analyze a fluctuating harmonic potential in which return trajectories are forcibly terminated the moment the particle reaches the origin, ensuring that all outward (diffusive) trajectories begin from the same point. This is implemented through instantaneous positional information: a feedback signal that shortens the return phase without incurring additional mechanical energetic cost. We examine several search protocols built on this controlled return mechanism and determine their mean first-passage times (MFPTs). Of particular interest is a protocol in which outward diffusion is eliminated entirely and the return motion itself becomes the search mechanism. This \"search by return\" perspective reverses the conventional logic of SR and yields a closed-form MFPT that highlights the efficiency of using return dynamics as the primary search strategy."

To better capture the count nature of the data, we introduce a 3D-consistent prior for flow matching that combines a learned zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) prior with a spatial-empirical prior constructed from neighboring sections. A global attention block introduces 3D H&E scaling linearly with the number of spots in the slide, enabling training and inference on large 3D ST datasets. Across three spatial transcriptomics datasets spanning different tissue types and resolutions, HoloTea consistently improves 3D expression accuracy and generalization compared to 2D and 3D baselines. We envision HoloTea advancing the creation of accurate 3D virtual tissues, ultimately accelerating biomarker discovery and deepening our understanding of disease."

    "abstract": "We study the three-dimensional incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations near Couette flow with a constant magnetic field perpendicular to the shear plane. Couette flow induces mixing and generates magnetic induction, while the constant magnetic field stabilizes $z$-dependent modes. In contrast, the $z$-averaged magnetic field exhibits algebraic growth. Letting $μ$ denote the inverse fluid and magnetic Reynolds numbers, we analyze how $μ$ governs stability thresholds in Sobolev spaces. We identify a nonlinear transient-growth regime characterized by the sharp threshold $5/6\\le γ\\le 1 $. For $x$-average-free initial data of size $μ^γ$, solutions are nonlinearly stable; however, for certain initial data, the solution departs from the linear dynamics at rate $μ^{γ-1}$ due to a first-order nonlinear instability. The exponent $γ= 5/6$ is optimal for the associated energy functional and cannot be improved in Sobolev spaces without secondary transient-growth mechanisms. Below this threshold, solutions necessarily transition away from the linear dynamics at a minimal rate. As a consequence, the $3d$ results yield sharp Sobolev stability thresholds for the $2d$ MHD equations around Couette flow without a constant magnetic field. In particular, the threshold is strictly larger than in prior $2d$ results with a constant field, revealing destabilizing effects normally suppressed by a constant magnetic field. Crucially, this stabilization is restricted to the direction of the magnetic field."

    "abstract": "Detecting political bias in news media is a complex task that requires interpreting subtle linguistic and contextual cues. Although recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have enabled automatic bias classification, the extent to which large language models (LLMs) align with human judgment still remains relatively underexplored and not yet well understood. This study aims to present a comparative framework for evaluating the detection of political bias across human annotations and multiple LLMs, including GPT, BERT, RoBERTa, and FLAN. We construct a manually annotated dataset of news articles and assess annotation consistency, bias polarity, and inter-model agreement to quantify divergence between human and model perceptions of bias. Experimental results show that among traditional transformer-based models, RoBERTa achieves the highest alignment with human labels, whereas generative models such as GPT demonstrate the strongest overall agreement with human annotations in a zero-shot setting. Among all transformer-based baselines, our fine-tuned RoBERTa model acquired the highest accuracy and the strongest alignment with human-annotated labels. Our findings highlight systematic differences in how humans and LLMs perceive political slant, underscoring the need for hybrid evaluation frameworks that combine human interpretability with model scalability in automated media bias detection."

    "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) make symbolic music generation increasingly accessible, producing music with distinctive composition and rich expressiveness remains a significant challenge. Many studies have introduced emotion models to guide the generative process. However, these approaches still fall short of delivering novelty and creativity. In the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR), auditory perception is recognized as a key dimension of musical experience, offering insights into both compositional intent and emotional patterns. To this end, we propose a neural network named CPFG-Net, along with a transformation algorithm that maps perceptual feature values to chord representations, enabling melody harmonization. The system can controllably predict sequences of perceptual features and tonal structures from given melodies, and subsequently generate harmonically coherent chord progressions. Our network is trained on our newly constructed perceptual feature dataset BCPT-220K, derived from classical music. Experimental results show state-of-the-art perceptual feature prediction capability of our model as well as demonstrate our musical expressiveness and creativity in chord inference. This work offers a novel perspective on melody harmonization and contributes to broader music generation tasks. Our symbolic-based model can be easily extended to audio-based models."

Yet converting unstructured educational materials, such as lecture notes and slides, into KGs that capture key pedagogical content remains difficult. We propose a framework for knowledge graph construction and refinement grounded in rate-distortion (RD) theory and optimal transport geometry. In the framework, lecture content is modeled as a metric-measure space, capturing semantic and relational structure, while candidate KGs are aligned using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion. The rate term, expressed via the size of KG, reflects complexity and compactness. Refinement operators (add, merge, split, remove, rewire) minimize the rate-distortion Lagrangian, yielding compact, information-preserving KGs. Our prototype applied to data science lectures yields interpretable RD curves and shows that MCQs generated from refined KGs consistently surpass those from raw notes on fifteen quality criteria. This study establishes a principled foundation for information-theoretic KG optimization in personalized and AI-assisted education."

While AI and human biases have been studied extensively in isolation, this paper examines their complex interaction. Specifically, we examined how class imbalance as an AI bias affects people's ability to appropriately rely on an AI-based decision-support system, and how it interacts with base rate neglect as a human bias. In a within-subject online study (N= 46), participants classified three diseases using an AI-based decision-support system trained on either a balanced or unbalanced dataset. We found that class imbalance disrupted participants' calibration of AI reliance. Moreover, we observed mutually reinforcing effects between class imbalance and base rate neglect, offering evidence of a compound human-AI bias. Based on these findings, we advocate for an interactionist perspective and further research into the mutually reinforcing effects of biases in human-AI interaction."

We simulate the gravitational collapse of isolated, parsec-scale turbulent cores using the FLASH code, modelling stars as sink particles. Our simulations incorporate ionizing radiation and the associated radiation pressure from stellar sources, and non-ionizing radiation and its dust heating, along with self-consistent chemistry, to capture the properties of emerging ultra-compact HII regions. Dust, gas, and radiation temperature are computed independently. The initial conditions are informed by ALMAGAL observations. We assess stellar feedback, comparing ionizing radiation and radiation pressure. Ionizing radiation ultimately halts mass accretion on to sink particles, while direct radiation pressure enhances the expansion of HII regions. Heating from non-ionizing radiation suppresses fragmentation. We examine the effect of spatial resolution, finding that higher resolution leads to more sink particles which are situated in environments with higher densities. As a result, ionizing radiation remains trapped longer, allowing continued accretion and yielding a higher overall star formation efficiency (SFE). We explore the impact of varying initial conditions, including the core density profile, virial parameter, and metallicity. Our parameter study reveals that a flatter density profile, higher virial parameter, and increased metallicity promote fragmentation, potentially enhancing the SFE by slowing the growth of the most massive stars and delaying the onset of stellar feedback. Overall, we find SFEs between 35% and 57%. Stellar feedback dictates the final SFE."

The approach is based on a two potential framework, similar to the concept of generalized standard materials (GSMs). To describe the material behavior, neural network-based free energy and dissipation potentials are employed. The evolution of crystallinity is derived from the two potentials and resembles a classical GSM-type equation. Two additional Lagrange multipliers together with the corresponding Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions are introduced to ensure boundedness of the crystallinity, such that it can be interpreted as a variable of concentration type. The neural network-based potentials ensure all physically desirable properties by construction. Most importantly, objectivity, material symmetry, and thermodynamic consistency are automatically fulfilled. In addition, an alternative derivation of the governing model equations in time-discrete form is presented based on an incremental variational framework, which also serves as the basis for a finite element implementation. We demonstrate the predictive capability of the PANN using three different experimental data sets from literature, considering both stress and crystallinity evolution at material point level as well as the corresponding field distributions in a notched specimen. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model can be flexibly employed for both unfilled and filled NR."

Furthermore, we apply the QME in a quantum Otto refrigerator, thereby increasing its cooling power. This proof-of-concept experiment unveils new practical paths for improving quantum thermal tasks."

    "abstract": "Incomplete data are common in real-world tabular applications, where numerical, categorical, and discrete attributes coexist within a single dataset. This heterogeneous structure presents significant challenges for existing diffusion-based imputation models, which typically assume a homogeneous feature space and rely on stochastic denoising trajectories. Such assumptions make it difficult to maintain conditional consistency, and they often lead to information collapse for categorical variables or instability when numerical variables require deterministic updates. These limitations indicate that a single diffusion process is insufficient for mixed-type tabular imputation. We propose a hybrid deterministic diffusion framework that separates heterogeneous features into two complementary generative channels. A continuous DDIM-based channel provides efficient and stable deterministic denoising for numerical variables, while a discrete latent-path diffusion channel, inspired by loopholing-based discrete diffusion, models categorical and discrete features without leaving their valid sample manifolds. The two channels are trained under a unified conditional imputation objective, enabling coherent reconstruction of mixed-type incomplete data. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves higher imputation accuracy, more stable sampling trajectories, and improved robustness across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR settings compared with existing diffusion-based and classical methods. These results demonstrate the importance of structure-aware diffusion processes for advancing deep learning approaches to incomplete tabular data."

This system exhibiting self similarity in different generations, can support localized modes either in the external or multiple internal corners depending on the controllable distortion introduced into first generation structure. Nonlinear corner modes can be selectively excited in this dissipative system using resonant optical pumping. Strong polariton-polariton interactions lead to tilt of the resonance curves and bistability as the pump amplitude increases, allowing control over corner state profiles. Linear stability analysis illustrates dynamical stability of such states. Our results show how nontrivial topology manifests itself in self similar, aperiodic structures and indicate that fractal geometry may bring qualitatively new localization scenarios in polariton HOTIs."

We follow the trend of dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting based methods, and address several significant challenges. To model complex hand-object interaction with mutual occlusion and edge blur, we present interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with newly introduced optimizable parameters aiming to adopt piecewise linear hypothesis for clearer structural representation. Moreover, considering the complementarity and tightness of hand shape and object shape during interaction dynamics, we incorporate hand information into object deformation field, constructing interaction-aware dynamic fields to model flexible motions. To further address difficulties in the optimization process, we propose a progressive strategy that handles dynamic regions and static background step by step. Correspondingly, explicit regularizations are designed to stabilize the hand-object representations for smooth motion transition, physical interaction reality, and coherent lighting. Experiments show that our approach surpasses existing dynamic 3D-GS-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing dynamic hand-object interaction."

The principle of the experiment is that use of line emission rather than the usual sub-keV quasi-blackbody source allows keV radiation to play a more dominant role compared to softer X-rays and thus mimic the effect of a blackbody with a higher effective spectral temperature. Our aim is to reproduce in the laboratory the extreme photoionization conditions found in accretion-powered astrophysical sources. In this paper, we compare the experimental results on K-$β$ X-ray Ar spectra with modelling using the time-dependent version of the Cloudy astrophysical code. The results indicate that photoionized laboratory plasmas can be successfully modelled with codes such as Cloudy that have been developed for application to astrophysical sources. Our comparison of simulation and experiment shows that the flux of sub-keV photons that photoionize the outer-shell electrons can have a significant effect, and that detailed measurements of the X-ray drive spectrum across all photon energy ranges are crucial for accurate modelling of experiments."

The model is integrated into a web application with an advanced graphical user interface (GUI), allowing physicians to specify preferences and hospital staff to configure the MIP model to their roster requirements without any mathematical or technical background. This approach enables easy adaptation to different hospitals or departments and straightforward updates in response to structural changes, such as new duties or modified qualifications. The applicability and effectiveness of the framework are demonstrated using real-world data from three departments in different hospitals specializing in internal medicine, cardiology, and orthopedics/trauma surgery. In one department, the system is already in everyday use, while in the other two, our model achieves comparable or improved roster quality relative to existing department-specific models, highlighting its potential as a versatile and practical tool for physician rostering."

We demonstrate the utility of this framework via simulations calibrated to realistic sensor densities and spatial coverage. Using the simulation framework, we explore the stability and performance of the approach with respect to the number of time points and data/covariate availability, demonstrating gains over single-source models through point and gridded data fusion.

There is a need for a single, reproducible case study that links questions, model building, diagnostics, and interpretation. Methods: We reanalyze a published mouse body-weight experiment with 31 mice in three groups weighed weekly for 12 weeks. After reshaping the data to long format and using profile plots to motivate linear time trends, we fit three random-intercept linear mixed models: a common-slope model, a fully interacted group-by-time model, and a parsimonious model with group-specific intercepts, a shared slope for two groups, and an extra slope for the third. Models are compared using maximum likelihood, AIC, BIC, and likelihood ratio tests, and linear contrasts are used to estimate group differences in weekly means and 12 week gains. Results: The parsimonious model fits as well as the fully interacted model and clearly outperforms the common-slope model, revealing small and similar gains in two groups and much steeper growth in the third, with highly significant contrasts for excess weight gain. Interpretation: This case study gives a complete, executable workflow for longitudinal linear mixed modeling, from raw data and exploratory plots through model selection, diagnostics, and targeted contrasts. By making explicit the mapping from scientific questions to model terms and estimable contrasts, and by providing R code and a stepwise checklist, it serves as a practical template for teaching and applied work in biostatistics, epidemiology, and related fields"

    "abstract": "Achieving a balance between lightweight design and high performance remains a significant challenge for speech enhancement (SE) tasks on resource-constrained devices. Existing state-of-the-art methods, such as MUSE, have established a strong baseline with only 0.51M parameters by introducing a Multi-path Enhanced Taylor (MET) transformer and Deformable Embedding (DE). However, an in-depth analysis reveals that MUSE still suffers from efficiency bottlenecks: the MET module relies on a complex \"approximate-compensate\" mechanism to mitigate the limitations of Taylor-expansion-based attention, while the offset calculation for deformable embedding introduces additional computational burden. This paper proposes IMSE, a systematically optimized and ultra-lightweight network. We introduce two core innovations: 1) Replacing the MET module with Amplitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA). MALA fundamentally rectifies the \"amplitude-ignoring\" problem in linear attention by explicitly preserving the norm information of query vectors in the attention calculation, achieving efficient global modeling without an auxiliary compensation branch. 2) Replacing the DE module with Inception Depthwise Convolution (IDConv). IDConv borrows the Inception concept, decomposing large-kernel operations into efficient parallel branches (square, horizontal, and vertical strips), thereby capturing spectrogram features with extremely low parameter redundancy. Extensive experiments on the VoiceBank+DEMAND dataset demonstrate that, compared to the MUSE baseline, IMSE significantly reduces the parameter count by 16.8\\% (from 0.513M to 0.427M) while achieving competitive performance comparable to the state-of-the-art on the PESQ metric (3.373). This study sets a new benchmark for the trade-off between model size and speech quality in ultra-lightweight speech enhancement."

Recent offloading systems migrate the KVCache to CPU memory and incorporate top-k attention to reduce the volume of data transferred from the CPU, while further applying system-level optimizations such as on-GPU caching and prefetching to lower transfer overhead. However, they overlook the CPU bottleneck in three aspects: (1) substantial overhead of fine-grained dynamic cache management performed on the CPU side, (2) significant transfer overhead from poor PCIe bandwidth utilization caused by heavy gathering operations at the CPU side, and (3) GPU runtime bubbles introduced by coarse-grained CPU-centric synchronization. To address these challenges, we propose CLO, a CPU-light KVCache offloading system via algorithm-system co-design. CLO features: (1) a coarse-grained head-wise approximate on-GPU caching strategy with negligible cache management cost, (2) seamless combination of data prefetching and on-GPU persistent caching for lower transfer overhead, (3) a zero-copy transfer engine to fully exploit PCIe bandwidth, and a GPU-centric synchronization method to eliminate GPU stalls. Evaluation on two widely-used LLMs demonstrates that CLO achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art systems, while substantially minimizing CPU overhead, fully utilizing PCIe bandwidth, thus improving decoding throughput by 9.3%-66.6%. Our results highlight that algorithm-system co-design is essential for memory-constrained LLM inference on modern GPU platforms. We open source CLO at https://github.com/CommediaJW/CLO."

    "abstract": "Electron matter waves coherently diffract when passing through a periodic structure of light formed by two interfering light waves. In this so-called Kapitza-Dirac effect, the electron momentum changes due to absorption and emission of photons via stimulated Compton scattering. Until now, the effect has only been observed with low energy electrons due to the small momentum of a visible photon compared to the momentum of high energy electron leading to diffraction angles of 10^(-4) rad or smaller. We report on the observation of the Kapitza-Dirac effect in a scanning electron microscope using high energy (20 keV and 30 keV) electrons with de-Broglie wavelengths of 9 pm and 7 pm, respectively. The photon sidebands in the electron transverse momentum spectrum are detected in the convergent beam diffraction geometry using spatial filtering. As the coupling strength between the electrons and the light field increases, the sideband populations exhibit coherent, reversible oscillations among diffraction orders. The effect can serve as a coherent electron beam-splitter or a phase-plate in various types of electron microscopes."

    "abstract": "We develop a hybrid qubit-qumode framework for simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions. In this approach, fermionic matter fields are represented by qubits, while U(1) gauge fields are encoded in continuous-variable bosonic modes whose canonical quadratures capture the electric and vector-potential components of the theory. To reconcile the non-compact phase space of the qumodes with the compact U(1) gauge symmetry, we introduce and compare two complementary constraint-enforcement strategies: (i) a squeezing-based projection that confines qumode states to the unit circle through an effective modification of the inner product, and (ii) a method that dynamically enforces compactness via a penalty Hamiltonian term. We construct the corresponding hybrid Hamiltonian, derive its decomposition into experimentally accessible qubit-qumode gates, and analyze its spectrum in the analytically tractable single-plaquette limit. The hybrid formulation reproduces the correct gauge-invariant dynamics and provides a scalable route toward simulating Abelian lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter on near-term hybrid quantum architectures. Ground-state preparation and convergence are demonstrated using a continuous-variable extension of the Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) algorithm, establishing a general framework for hybrid discrete-continuous quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories."

An auxiliary subnetwork is integrated into a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to enable spatial feature learning. An optimization method is then developed to refine the RSS predictions by aggregating multiple prediction sets, achieving an improved localization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a root mean squared error (RMSE) comparable to the ground-truth measurements while outperforming state-of-the-art reconstruction methods. When the reconstructed fingerprint is combined with measured data for training, the fingerprinting localization achieves accuracy comparable to models trained on fully measured datasets."

Our goal is to devise an effective multi-view imaging technique that can jointly leverage the targets' echo signals at all the receive BSs to precisely construct the image of these targets. To achieve this goal, we propose a two-phase approach. In Phase I, each receive BS recovers an individual image based on the sample covariance matrix of its received signals. Specifically, we propose a novel covariance-based imaging framework to jointly estimate effective scattering intensity and grid positions, which reduces the number of estimated parameters leveraging channel statistical properties and allows grid adjustment to conform to target geometry. In Phase II, the CPU fuses the individual images of all the receivers to construct a high-quality image of all the targets. Specifically, we design edge-preserving natural neighbor interpolation (EP-NNI) to map individual heterogeneous images onto common and finer grids, and then propose a joint optimization framework to estimate fused scattering intensity and BS fields of view. Extensive numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly enhances imaging performance, facilitating high-quality environment reconstruction for future 6G networks."

These clumps dominate the stellar mass budget of the Misty Moons ($\\gtrsim80\\%$), similar to other high-$z$ clumps, which suggests a highly clustered mode of star formation in the early Universe, unlike seen in local dwarf galaxies. We convolve the source-plane image with the JWST/NIRCam point-spread function to produce a mock NIRCam image of the Misty Moons without lensing magnification, and find that the intrinsic galaxy has a radial surface-brightness profile comparable to those of $z\\gtrsim10$ faint galaxies, such as JADES-GS-z13-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1, indicating that the Misty Moons represents a typical $z\\gtrsim10$ faint galaxy.

    "abstract": "Delineating farm boundaries through segmentation of satellite images is a fundamental step in many agricultural applications. The task is particularly challenging for smallholder farms, where accurate delineation requires the use of high resolution (HR) imagery which are available only at low revisit frequencies (e.g., annually). To support more frequent (sub-) seasonal monitoring, HR images could be combined as references (ref) with low resolution (LR) images -- having higher revisit frequency (e.g., weekly) -- using reference-based super-resolution (Ref-SR) methods. However, current Ref-SR methods optimize perceptual quality and smooth over crucial features needed for downstream tasks, and are unable to meet the large scale-factor requirements for this task. Further, previous two-step approaches of SR followed by segmentation do not effectively utilize diverse satellite sources as inputs. We address these problems through a new approach, $\\textbf{SEED-SR}$, which uses a combination of conditional latent diffusion models and large-scale multi-spectral, multi-source geo-spatial foundation models. Our key innovation is to bypass the explicit SR task in the pixel space and instead perform SR in a segmentation-aware latent space. This unique approach enables us to generate segmentation maps at an unprecedented 20$\\times$ scale factor, and rigorous experiments on two large, real datasets demonstrate up to $\\textbf{25.5}$ and $\\textbf{12.9}$ relative improvement in instance and semantic segmentation metrics respectively over approaches based on state-of-the-art Ref-SR methods."

In this work we propose several approaches to effectively increase item diversity within the domain of book recommendations, on top of a collaborative filtering algorithm. These approaches are intended to improve book recommendations in the web catalogs of public libraries. Furthermore, we introduce metrics to evaluate the resulting strategies, and show that the proposed system finds a suitable balance between accuracy and beyond-accuracy aspects."

The automated line identifications by PyEMILI demonstrate significant improvements in both completeness and accuracy compared to the previous manual identifications in the literature. Since our last report of PyEMILI, the atomic transition database used by the code has been further expanded by cross-matching the Kurucz Line Lists. Moreover, to aid the PyEMILI identification of numerous faint optical recombination lines (ORLs) of CII, NII, OII and NeII, we compiled a new dataset of effective recombination coefficients for these nebular lines, and created a new subroutine in the code to generate theoretical spectra of heavy-element ORLs at various electron temperature and density cases; these theoretical spectra can be used to fit the observed recombination spectrum of a PN to obtain the electron temperature, density and ionic abundances using the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We present MCMC-derived parameters for a sample of PNe. This work establishes PyEMILI as a robust and versatile tool for both line identification and plasma diagnostics in deep spectroscopy of gaseous nebulae."

    "abstract": "Approximate duals of B-splines were first used by Chui et al. (2004) for the purpose of constructing tight wavelet frames on bounded intervals. They are splines with local support, whose inner product with a polynomial in the spline space provides the exact coefficient in the representation of the same polynomial in the B-spline basis. This implies that the associated integral operator is a quasi-projection in the sense of Jia (2004). Moreover, the approximation of smooth functions in Sobolev spaces by this quasi-projection yields the optimal approximation order. More recently, for applications in isogeometric analysis, the optimal approximation order should also be obtained for functions in a slightly larger space, the so-called bent Sobolev space defined in \\cite{Bazilevsetal2006,daVeigaetal2014}. This requires the construction of enhanced approximate duals, whose corresponding integral operator provides the exact representation of all spline functions with respect to a coarse knot vector, using only few interior knots of the given knot vector. Our analysis provides an explicit construction and hints for an efficient computation of enhanced approximate duals. Explicit representations as linear combinations of B-splines are provided for $m=2$ and $m=3$, and two numerical examples for splines of order $3\\le m\\le 6$ demonstrate the optimal approximation order for functions in bent Sobolev spaces."

The variability of human behaviour poses particular challenges for formal verification and synthesis. We present a model-based framework that enables design-time exploration of safe shared-control strategies in human-automation systems. The approach combines active automata learning -- to derive coarse, finite-state abstractions of human behaviour from simulations -- with game-theoretic reactive synthesis to determine whether a controller can guarantee safety when interacting with these models. If no such strategy exists, the framework supports iterative refinement of the human model or adjustment of the automation's controllable actions. A driving case study, integrating automata learning with reactive synthesis in UPPAAL, illustrates the applicability of the framework on a simplified driving scenario and its potential for analysing shared-control strategies in human-centred cyber-physical systems."

We performed X-ray monitoring of the source with NICER and AstroSat near the peak of the event. Our primary objective is to investigate the energy and luminosity dependence of the pulsed emission, characterize the spin evolution, and study the broadband X-ray spectral properties of RX J0520.5-6932 during the outburst. The AstroSat/LAXPC and NICER light curves reveal pronounced short-duration flaring activity lasting ~400-700 s, with enhancements by a factor of ~2. The pulse profile exhibits a strong dependence on both energy and intensity, evolving from a simple single-peaked structure at low energies to complex multi-peaked shapes at intermediate energies, and reverting to simpler morphologies at higher energies. Pulse profiles during the flares differ significantly from those in the persistent state, indicating changes in the pulsed beam pattern with a change in the intensity on a short timescale. Broadband spectral analysis reveals a soft excess and an emission feature at ~1 keV, likely arising from reprocessed emission in the accretion disc and fluorescence from Ne K and Fe L ions. Continuous NICER monitoring over nearly one orbital cycle enabled us to track spin evolution with accretion-driven spin-up and spectral variability in the soft X-ray band. Additionally, a declining spin-up rate is observed during the outburst, likely due to a gradual reduction in mass accretion rate. Our results provide a comprehensive view of the complex accretion dynamics in RX J0520.5-6932 during its 2024 outburst. The strong variability in pulse shape and spin behaviour highlights rapid changes in the accretion geometry and torque as a function of accretion rate. [Abridged]"

The field of Explainability Engineering tackles this challenge by developing explanation models at design time. These models are designed from system design artefacts and stakeholder needs to develop correct and good explanations. To support this field, we propose an approach that enables context-aware, ante-hoc explanations of (un)expectable driving manoeuvres at runtime. The visual yet formal language Traffic Sequence Charts is used to formalise explanation contexts, as well as corresponding (un)expectable driving manoeuvres. A dedicated runtime monitoring enables context-recognition and ante-hoc presentation of explanations at runtime. In combination, we aim to support the bridging of correct and good explanations.

However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process. MiAD achieves an $8.2\\%$ S.U.N. rate on the MP-20 dataset, which substantially exceeds existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Our goal is to constrain the chemistry and kinematics of the gas phase molecules detected in the inner disc. We use iSLAT to examine the observed molecular lines and DuCKLiNG to detect, fit, and analyse the molecular emission. We find gas phase H2O, CO, CO2, and OH in the disc, as well as HI recombination lines. Surprisingly, we also detect gas phase SiO in the fundamental v=1-0 vibrational band. We derive column densities and temperature ranges of the detected species, arising from the inner ~0.2 au, hinting towards a compact and very warm disc. The molecular column densities are much higher than found in lower mass T Tauri discs. In general, the molecular composition is consistent with an O-rich gas from which silicate-rich solids condense and the strong gas phase molecular line emission suggests a low dust opacity. The unexpected detection of gas phase SiO at the source velocity points to an incomplete condensation of rock forming elements in the disc, suggesting chemical disequilibrium and/or an underestimate of the gas kinetic temperature."

Guided by these insights, we developed PACEE, an assistant for supporting parent-AI collaborative emotion education. PACEE enables parents to engage in emotional dialogues about common scenarios, with multiple forms of support provided by generative AI. It combines insights from parents and AI to model children's emotional states and collaboratively delivers personalized, parent-mediated guidance. In a user study involving 16 families, we found that PACEE significantly enhances parent-child engagement, encourages more in-depth emotional communication, and improves the parental experience. Our findings advance emotion coaching theory in both family settings and LLM-assisted contexts, offering valuable insights for designing AI-supported, parent-centered family education systems."

High-precision few-body methods, such as the Gaussian Expansion Method (GEM), are applicable to solve quantum few-body systems up to four- and five-body systems. By combining the HAL QCD potentials with the GEM, one can predict the level structure of novel hypernuclei prior to experimental observation. In this review, we utilize the lattice QCD $NΞ$ potential obtained by the HAL QCD method to investigate the few-body systems $NNΞ$ and $NNNΞ$. Our analysis indicates that the lightest bound $Ξ$ hypernucleus is the $NNNΞ$ system. To extract detailed information on the isospin and spin components of the $NΞ$ interaction, we perform a four-body calculation for the $ααNΞ$ system with the total isospin $T = 0$ and $T = 1$. We demonstrate that the level structure of this system is sensitive to the isospin and spin dependencies of the $NΞ$ interaction. Furthermore, we propose experimental investigations to produce the $NNNΞ$ and $ααNΞ$ systems via the $(K^-, K^+)$ and $(K^-, K^0)$ reactions on $^4$He and $^{10}$B targets, respectively."

At the heart of Wave-Former's design is a novel three-stage pipeline which bridges raw wireless signals with recent advancements in vision-based shape completion by incorporating physical properties of mmWave signals. The pipeline proposes candidate geometric surfaces, employs a transformer-based shape completion model designed specifically for mmWave signals, and finally performs entropy-guided surface selection. This enables Wave-Former to be trained using entirely synthetic point-clouds, while demonstrating impressive generalization to real-world data.In head-to-head comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines, Wave-Former raises recall from 54% to 72% while maintaining a high precision of 85%."

    "abstract": "Mass spectra and Mott transitions of neutral mesons $K_0, π_0, η, η'$ at finite temperature and magnetic field are investigated in a three-flavor PNJL model. We focus on the effect of gluons, which is simulated by the Polyakov potential and the inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) effect, which is mimicked by using a magnetic field dependent coupling constant. Mass spectra show similar structure when introducing the contribution of Polyakov potential and IMC effect. The mass of $K_0$ meson $m_{K_0}$ is controlled by chiral symmetry breaking and restoration. It increases with temperature in the low temperature region, and shows a mass jump at the Mott transition. Further increasing temperature, $m_{K_0}$ firstly decreases and then increases with temperature. $π_0$ meson is not only the pseudo-Goldstone boson of chiral symmetry breaking, but also influenced by the flavor mixing of $π_0-η-η'$. The behavior of $m_{π_0}$ is different from $m_{K_0}$ only at high temperature region, which decreases with temperature. For $η$ and $η'$ mesons, they are affected by both the $U_A(1)$ anomaly and the flavor mixing of $π_0-η-η'$. The mass of $η$ meson $m_η$ decreases with temperature in low temperature region and then shows a jump at its Mott transition. After that $m_η$ firstly decreases and later increases with temperature. $η'$ mesons is a resonant state in vacuum and in medium, and its mass $m_{η'}$ continuously decreases and then increases with temperature. The mass jumps of $K_0, π_0, η$ mesons are caused by the dimension reduction of the constituent quarks under external magnetic field. In the PNJL model, the Mott transition temperature of $K_0,\\ π_0$ mesons ($ η$ meson) decrease (increases) with magnetic field. The IMC effect leads to the lower value for meson Mott transition temperature."

    "abstract": "Recent trends in SLAM and visual navigation have embraced 3D Gaussians as the preferred scene representation, highlighting the importance of estimating camera poses from a single image using a pre-built Gaussian model. However, existing approaches typically rely on an iterative \\textit{render-compare-refine} loop, where candidate views are first rendered using NeRF or Gaussian Splatting, then compared against the target image, and finally, discrepancies are used to update the pose. This multi-round process incurs significant computational overhead, hindering real-time performance in robotics. In this paper, we propose iGaussian, a two-stage feed-forward framework that achieves real-time camera pose estimation through direct 3D Gaussian inversion. Our method first regresses a coarse 6DoF pose using a Gaussian Scene Prior-based Pose Regression Network with spatial uniform sampling and guided attention mechanisms, then refines it through feature matching and multi-model fusion. The key contribution lies in our cross-correlation module that aligns image embeddings with 3D Gaussian attributes without differentiable rendering, coupled with a Weighted Multiview Predictor that fuses features from Multiple strategically sampled viewpoints. Experimental results on the NeRF Synthetic, Mip-NeRF 360, and T\\&T+DB datasets demonstrate a significant performance improvement over previous methods, reducing median rotation errors to 0.2° while achieving 2.87 FPS tracking on mobile robots, which is an impressive 10 times speedup compared to optimization-based approaches.

In particular, jailbreak attacks that bypass built-in safety mechanisms are increasingly recognized as a tangible threat across industries, driving the need for diverse templates to support red-teaming efforts and strengthen defensive techniques. However, current approaches predominantly rely on two limited strategies: (i) substituting harmful queries into fixed templates, and (ii) having the LLM generate entire templates, which often compromises intent clarity and reproductibility. To address this gap, this paper introduces the Embedded Jailbreak Template, which preserves the structure of existing templates while naturally embedding harmful queries within their context. We further propose a progressive prompt-engineering methodology to ensure template quality and consistency, alongside standardized protocols for generation and evaluation. Together, these contributions provide a benchmark that more accurately reflects real-world usage scenarios and harmful intent, facilitating its application in red-teaming and policy regression testing."

In the late stages of stellar evolution, intense shell burning can cause distinct convective regions to merge, fundamentally restructuring the stellar interior. Although such phenomena are difficult to observe directly, the observation of ``Mg-rich'' supernova remnants (SNRs) has recently emerged as a potential signature of these events. In this study, we reanalyze X-ray observations of J0550--6823, a SNR in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and a new candidate Mg-rich SNR. Our spectral analysis confirms a low Ne/Mg mass ratio of $\\approx$1, and its classification as Mg-rich. By comparing the observational results with pre-supernova models, we suggest that the progenitor of J0550-6823 likely had an extended convective shell that reduces the Ne/Mg ratio prior to its explosion. Furthermore, we observe that $\\sim$2--3 Mg-rich SNRs exist in the LMC, suggesting that $\\lesssim$10--40\\% of massive stars in the LMC may have had an extended convective shell, similar to what we observed in J0550-6823.

Building upon the ideal-theoretic, computational, and categorical foundations of Papers A to D (Rao 2025A, Rao 2025B1, Rao 2025B2, Rao 2025C, Rao 2025D), the present study constructs the algebraic and geometric infrastructure necessary to place Gamma-semirings within the modern language of derived and categorical geometry. We define the affine Gamma-spectrum Spec_Gamma(T) together with its structure sheaf O_{Spec_Gamma(T)}, establishing a Zariski-type topology adapted to ternary Gamma-operations. In this setting, the category of Gamma-modules is shown to be additive, exact, and monoidal-closed, supporting derived functors Ext_Gamma and Tor^Gamma, whose existence is ensured through explicit projective and injective resolutions. The derived category D(T-Gamma-Mod) is then constructed to host homological dualities and Serre-type vanishing theorems, culminating in a categorical analogue of the Serre-Swan correspondence (Swan 1962, Gelfand 1960) for Gamma-modules. Geometric and categorical unification is achieved through fibered and derived Gamma-stacks, which provide a natural environment for studying morphisms of affine Gamma-schemes and cohomological descent. The theory connects with noncommutative geometry and higher-arity (n-ary) generalizations, showing that derived Gamma-geometry forms a coherent homological universe capable of expressing algebraic, geometric, and physical dualities within one categorical law. Computational methods for finite Gamma-semirings and applications to mathematical physics, where ternary operations model triadic couplings, are also discussed."

The existing LTR methods based on cross-entropy (CE) loss not only struggle to learn features with desirable properties but also couple imbalanced classifier vectors in the denominator of its Softmax, amplifying the imbalance effects in LTR. In this paper, for the LTR, we propose a binary cross-entropy (BCE)-based tripartite synergistic learning, termed BCE3S, which consists of three components: (1) BCE-based joint learning optimizes both the classifier and sample features, which achieves better compactness and separability among features than the CE-based joint learning, by decoupling the metrics between feature and the imbalanced classifier vectors in multiple Sigmoid; (2) BCE-based contrastive learning further improves the intra-class compactness of features; (3) BCE-based uniform learning balances the separability among classifier vectors and interactively enhances the feature properties by combining with the joint learning. The extensive experiments show that the LTR model trained by BCE3S not only achieves higher compactness and separability among sample features, but also balances the classifier's separability, achieving SOTA performance on various long-tailed datasets such as CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018."

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) greatly enhances large language models (LLMs) performance in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, naive RAG methods struggle with multi-hop question answering due to their limited capacity to capture complex dependencies across documents. Recent studies employ graph-based RAG to capture document connections. However, these approaches often result in a loss of semantic coherence and introduce irrelevant noise during node matching and subgraph construction. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroPath, an LLM-driven semantic path tracking RAG framework inspired by the path navigational planning of place cells in neurobiology. It consists of two steps: Dynamic Path Tracking and Post-retrieval Completion. Dynamic Path Tracking performs goal-directed semantic path tracking and pruning over the constructed knowledge graph (KG), improving noise reduction and semantic coherence. Post-retrieval Completion further reinforces these benefits by conducting second-stage retrieval using intermediate reasoning and the original query to refine the query goal and complete missing information in the reasoning path. NeuroPath surpasses current state-of-the-art baselines on three multi-hop QA datasets, achieving average improvements of 16.3% on recall@2 and 13.5% on recall@5 over advanced graph-based RAG methods. Moreover, compared to existing iter-based RAG methods, NeuroPath achieves higher accuracy and reduces token consumption by 22.8%. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of NeuroPath across four smaller LLMs (Llama3.1, GLM4, Mistral0.3, and Gemma3), and further validate its scalability across tasks of varying complexity.

Notably, an epistatically constrained population achieves maximal average fitness at an intermediate level of environmental stochasticity. We then extend this framework to more complex systems, demonstrating robust hysteresis loops in both a disordered multi-locus model and in biophysically realistic simulation of protein structural flexibility. Finally, we present direct empirical evidence of evolutionary hysteresis. By analyzing two decades of metagenomic time-series data from freshwater C. Nanopelagicaceae experiencing strong seasonal temperature cycles, we find that approximately 65% of seasonally oscillating alleles exhibit statistically significant hysteresis. Together, these results establish hysteresis as a general, measurable feature of evolution and a potential probe of complex fitness landscapes."

Our approach extends privacy auditing beyond traditional membership inference to protected attributes, with labels as a special case, addressing a key gap in existing techniques. We provide theoretical foundations for our method and perform experiments on Criteo and CIFAR-10 datasets that demonstrate its effectiveness in auditing label privacy guarantees.

To address this, we propose SCAR, a Semantic-Context-driven method for Autoregressive models. SCAR introduces two key components: Compressed Semantic Prefilling, which encodes high-level semantics into a compact and efficient prefix, and Semantic Alignment Guidance, which aligns the last visual hidden states with target semantics during autoregressive decoding to enhance instruction fidelity. Unlike decoding-stage injection methods, SCAR builds upon the flexibility and generality of vector-quantized-based prefilling while overcoming its semantic limitations and high cost. It generalizes across both next-token and next-set AR paradigms with minimal architectural changes. SCAR achieves superior visual fidelity and semantic alignment on both instruction editing and controllable generation benchmarks, outperforming prior AR-based methods while maintaining controllability.

Exponential maps preserve geodesics but have stiff, radius-dependent Jacobians, while volume-preserving charts maintain densities but distort geodesic distances. Both approaches entangle curvature with model parameters, inflating gradient variance. In high-dimensional latent normalizing flows, the wrapped exponential prior can stretch radii far beyond the curvature scale, leading to poor test likelihoods and stiff solvers. We introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric method that selects the base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. RC lets radial parameters retain their usual meaning in geodesic units, while the chart can be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. We extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume and show that RC is the only construction for geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. We derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information, with smaller dial values reducing gradient variance and flow cost. Empirically, RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models. RC improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows, making RC-bExp a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds."

This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale."

Conventional encryption schemes such as AES, TDES, ECC, and ElGamal provide strong cryptographic guarantees, but they remain fundamentally agnostic to where decryption takes place.In practice, this means that once a decryption key is leaked or intercepted, any adversary can misuse the key to decrypt the protected content from any location. We present a location-dependent cryptosystem in which the decryption key is not transmitted as human- or machine-readable data, but implicitly encoded in precise time-of-flight differences of ultra-wideband (UWB) data transmission packets. The system leverages precise timing hardware and a custom JMTK protocol to map a SHA-256 hashed AES key onto scheduled transmission timestamps. Only receivers located within a predefined spatial region can observe the packet timings that align with the intended \"time slot\" pattern, enabling them to reconstruct the key and decrypt the secret. Receivers outside the authorized region observe incorrect keys. We implement a complete prototype that encrypts and transmits audio data using our cryptosystem, and only when the receiver is within the authorized data, they are able to decrypt the data. Our evaluation demonstrates that the system (i) removes the need to share decryption passwords electronically or physically, (ii) ensures the decryption key cannot be recovered by the eavesdropper, and (iii) provides a non-trivial spatial tolerance for legitimate users."

In this paper, we propose HiEAG, a novel Hierarchical Evidence-Augmented Generation framework to refine external consistency checking through leveraging the extensive knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach decomposes external consistency checking into a comprehensive engine pipeline, which integrates reranking and rewriting, apart from retrieval. Evidence reranking module utilizes Automatic Evidence Selection Prompting (AESP) that acquires the relevant evidence item from the products of evidence retrieval. Subsequently, evidence rewriting module leverages Automatic Evidence Generation Prompting (AEGP) to improve task adaptation on MLLM-based OOC misinformation detectors. Furthermore, our approach enables explanation for judgment, and achieves impressive performance with instruction tuning. Experimental results on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed HiEAG surpasses previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the accuracy over all samples."

    "abstract": "Robust and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding remains a fundamental open problem. While optical sensors such as RGB and LiDAR offer high spatial fidelity, they suffer from severe occlusions and introduce privacy risks in indoor environments. In contrast, millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar preserves privacy and penetrates obstacles, but its inherently low spatial resolution makes reliable geometric reasoning difficult. We introduce RISE, the first benchmark and system for single-static-radar indoor scene understanding, jointly targeting layout reconstruction and object detection. RISE is built upon the key insight that multipath reflections, traditionally treated as noise, encode rich geometric cues. To exploit this, we propose a Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement that explicitly models Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure to recover secondary (ghost) reflections and reveal invisible structures. On top of these enhanced observations, a simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework transforms fragmented radar responses into complete layout reconstruction and object detection. Our benchmark contains 50,000 frames collected across 100 real indoor trajectories, forming the first large-scale dataset dedicated to radar-based indoor scene understanding. Extensive experiments show that RISE reduces the Chamfer Distance by 60% (down to 16 cm) compared to the state of the art in layout reconstruction, and delivers the first mmWave-based object detection, achieving 58% IoU. These results establish RISE as a new foundation for geometry-aware and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding using a single static radar."

    "abstract": "Post-disaster reconnaissance reports contain critical evidence for understanding multi-hazard interactions, yet their unstructured narratives make systematic knowledge transfer difficult. Large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for analyzing these reports, but often generate unreliable or hallucinated outputs when domain grounding is absent. This study introduces the Mixture-of-Retrieval Agentic RAG (MoRA-RAG), a knowledge-grounded LLM framework that transforms reconnaissance reports into a structured foundation for multi-hazard reasoning. The framework integrates a Mixture-of-Retrieval mechanism that dynamically routes queries across hazard-specific databases while using agentic chunking to preserve contextual coherence during retrieval. It also includes a verification loop that assesses evidence sufficiency, refines queries, and initiates targeted searches when information remains incomplete. We construct HazardRecQA by deriving question-answer pairs from GEER reconnaissance reports, which document 90 global events across seven major hazard types. MoRA-RAG achieves up to 94.5 percent accuracy, outperforming zero-shot LLMs by 30 percent and state-of-the-art RAG systems by 10 percent, while reducing hallucinations across diverse LLM architectures. MoRA-RAG also enables open-weight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to proprietary models. It establishes a new paradigm for transforming post-disaster documentation into actionable, trustworthy intelligence for hazard resilience."

    "abstract": "Research on affective visualization design has shown that color is an especially powerful feature for influencing the emotional connotation of visualizations. Associations between colors and emotions are largely driven by lightness (e.g., lighter colors are associated with positive emotions, whereas darker colors are associated with negative emotions). Designing visualizations to have all light or all dark colors to convey particular emotions may work well for visualizations in which colors represent categories and spatial channels encode data values. However, this approach poses a problem for visualizations that use color to represent spatial patterns in data (e.g., colormap data visualizations) because lightness contrast is needed to reveal fine details in spatial structure. In this study, we found it is possible to design colormaps that have strong lightness contrast to support spatial vision while communicating clear affective connotation. We also found that affective connotation depended not only on the color scales used to construct the colormaps, but also the frequency with which colors appeared in the map, as determined by the underlying dataset (data-dependence hypothesis). These results emphasize the importance of data-aware design, which accounts for not only the design features that encode data (e.g., colors, shapes, textures), but also how those design features are instantiated in a visualization, given the properties of the data."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) raises expectations of substantial increases in rates of technological and scientific progress, but such anticipations are often not connected to detailed ground-level studies of AI use in innovation processes. Accordingly, it remains unclear how and to what extent AI can accelerate innovation. To help to fill this gap, we report results from 32 interviews with U.S.-based academic manufacturing and materials sciences researchers experienced with AI and machine learning (ML) techniques. Interviewees primarily used AI for modeling of materials and manufacturing processes, facilitating cheaper and more rapid search of design spaces for materials and manufacturing processes alike. They report benefits including cost, time, and computation savings in technology development. However, interviewees also report that AI/ML tools are unreliable outside design spaces for which dense data are already available; that they require skilled and judicious application in tandem with older research techniques; and that AI/ML tools may detrimentally circumvent opportunities for disruptive theoretical advancement. Based on these results, we suggest there is reason for optimism about acceleration in sustaining innovations through the use of to AI/ML; but that support for conventional empirical, computational, and theoretical research is required to maintain the likelihood of further major advances in manufacturing and materials science."

However, the transport-layer security for such 3D content remains largely unaddressed. Existing volumetric streaming pipelines inherit uniform encryption schemes from 2D video, overlooking the heterogeneous privacy sensitivity of different geometry and the strict motion-to-photon latency constraints of real-time XR. We take an initial step toward content-aware secure volumetric video delivery by introducing Privis, a saliency-guided transport framework that (i) partitions volumetric assets into independent units, (ii) applies lightweight authenticated encryption with adaptive key rotation, and (iii) employs selective traffic shaping to balance confidentiality and low latency. Privis specifies a generalized transport-layer security architecture for volumetric media, defining core abstractions and adaptive protection mechanisms. We further explore a prototype implementation and present initial latency measurements to illustrate feasibility and design tradeoffs, providing early empirical guidance toward future work on real-time, saliency-conditioned secure delivery."

RECAP starts by pre-training a generalist VLA with offline RL, which we call $π^{*}_{0.6}$, that can then be specialized to attain high performance on downstream tasks through on-robot data collection. We show that the $π^{*}_{0.6}$ model trained with the full RECAP method can fold laundry in real homes, reliably assemble boxes, and make espresso drinks using a professional espresso machine.

Compared to similarity-based merging or pruning, the confidence signal in Co-Me reliably indicates regions emphasized by the transformer, enabling substantial acceleration without degrading performance. Co-Me applies seamlessly to various multi-view and streaming visual geometric transformers, achieving speedups that scale with sequence length. When applied to VGGT and MapAnything, Co-Me achieves up to $11.3\\times$ and $7.2\\times$ speedup, making visual geometric transformers practical for real-time 3D perception and reconstruction."

    "abstract": "Vector search has been widely employed in recommender system and retrieval-augmented-generation pipelines, commonly performed with vector indexes to efficiently find similar items in large datasets. Recent growths in both data and task complexity have motivated placing vector indexes onto remote storage -- cloud-native vector search, which cloud providers have recently introduced services for. Yet, despite varying workload characteristics and various available vector index forms, providers default to using cluster-based indexes, which on paper do adapt well to differences between disk and cloud-based environment: their fetch granularities and lack of notable intra-query dependencies aligns with the large optimal fetch sizes and minimizes costly round-trips (i.e., as opposed to graph-based indexes) to remote storage, respectively. This paper systematically studies cloud-native vector search: What and how should indexes be built and used for on-cloud vector search? We analyze bottlenecks of two common index classes, cluster and graph indexes, on remote storage, and show that despite current standardized adoption of cluster indexes on the cloud, graph indexes are favored in workloads requiring high concurrency and recall, or operating on high-dimensional data or large datatypes. We further find that on-cloud search demands significantly different indexing and search parameterizations versus on-disk search for optimal performance. Finally, we incorporate existing cloud-based caching setups into vector search and find that certain index optimizations work against caching, and study how this can be mitigated to maximize gains under various available cache sizes."

These gates are constructed using a sequence of single-flux quantum (SFQ) pulses that are sent to the qubit through either capacitive or inductive coupling. The schedule of SFQ pulses is constructed with an on-ramp and an off-ramp applied prior to and after a pulse train, where the pulses are spaced at intervals equal to the qubit period. We reduce the optimization problem to the scheduling of a fixed number of SFQ pulses in the on-ramp and solve it by relaxing the discretization constraint of the SFQ clock as an intermediate step, allowing the use of the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno optimizer. Using this approach, gate fidelities of 99.99 % can be achieved for inductive coupling and 99.9 % for capacitive coupling, with leakage being the main source of coherent errors for both approaches."

For drug discovery specifically, a key inflection - akin to vision's \"ImageNet moment\" - arrived in 2015, when deep neural networks surpassed traditional approaches on the Tox21 Data Challenge. This milestone accelerated the adoption of deep learning across the pharmaceutical industry, and today most major companies have integrated these methods into their research pipelines. After the Tox21 Challenge concluded, its dataset was included in several established benchmarks, such as MoleculeNet and the Open Graph Benchmark. However, during these integrations, the dataset was altered and labels were imputed or manufactured, resulting in a loss of comparability across studies. Consequently, the extent to which bioactivity and toxicity prediction methods have improved over the past decade remains unclear. To this end, we introduce a reproducible leaderboard, hosted on Hugging Face with the original Tox21 Challenge dataset, together with a set of baseline and representative methods. The current version of the leaderboard indicates that the original Tox21 winner - the ensemble-based DeepTox method - and the descriptor-based self-normalizing neural networks introduced in 2017, continue to perform competitively and rank among the top methods for toxicity prediction, leaving it unclear whether substantial progress in toxicity prediction has been achieved over the past decade. As part of this work, we make all baselines and evaluated models publicly accessible for inference via standardized API calls to Hugging Face Spaces."

    "abstract": "Despite the growing availability of 3D urban datasets, extracting insights remains challenging due to computational bottlenecks and the complexity of interacting with data. In fact, the intricate geometry of 3D urban environments results in high degrees of occlusion and requires extensive manual viewpoint adjustments that make large-scale exploration inefficient. To address this, we propose a view-based approach for 3D data exploration, where a vector field encodes views from the environment. To support this approach, we introduce a neural field-based method that constructs an efficient implicit representation of 3D environments. This representation enables both faster direct queries, which consist of the computation of view assessment indices, and inverse queries, which help avoid occlusion and facilitate the search for views that match desired data patterns. Our approach supports key urban analysis tasks such as visibility assessments, solar exposure evaluation, and assessing the visual impact of new developments. We validate our method through quantitative experiments, case studies informed by real-world urban challenges, and feedback from domain experts. Results show its effectiveness in finding desirable viewpoints, analyzing building facade visibility, and evaluating views from outdoor spaces.

Compared to our previous work, in addition to using squeezing as a resource, the present architecture reduces damping and noise by minimizing the number of homodyne measurements required in GKP state generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these improvements - including dynamic input-state resetting and an improved breeding algorithm - by achieving a fault-tolerance threshold of 11.5 dB cluster squeezing using the RHG surface code for error correction, without requiring active switching or photon-number resource states."

Say we are given information on the poles of $A(s)$ with $|\\Im s| \\leq T$ for some large constant $T$. What is the best way to use such finite spectral data to give explicit estimates on sums $\\sum_{n\\leq x} a_n$? The problem of giving explicit bounds on the Mertens function $M(x) = \\sum_{n\\leq x} μ(n)$ illustrates how open this basic question was. Bounding $M(x)$ might seem equivalent to estimating $ψ(x) = \\sum_{n\\leq x} Λ(n)$ or the number of primes $\\leq x$. However, we have long had fairly good explicit bounds on prime counts, while bounding $M(x)$ remained a notoriously stubborn problem. We prove a sharp, general result on sums $\\sum_{n\\leq x} a_n n^{-σ}$ for $a_n$ bounded, giving an optimal way to use information on the poles of $A(s)$ with $|\\Im s|\\leq T$ and no data on the poles above. Our bounds on $M(x)$ are stronger than previous ones by many orders of magnitude. (Similar results for $ψ(x)$ are given in a companion paper.) Using rigorous residue computations by D. Platt, we obtain, for $x\\geq 1$, $$|M(x)|\\leq \\frac{3}{π\\cdot 10^{10}}\\cdot x + 11.39 \\sqrt{x}.$$ This is a corollary of our main result, essentially an explicit formula with the contribution of each pole clearly stated; we shall discuss how this finer structure can be useful. Our proof mixes a Fourier-analytic approach in the style of Wiener--Ikehara with contour-shifting, using optimal approximants of Beurling--Selberg type (Carneiro--Littmann, 2013); for $σ=1$, the approximant in (Vaaler, 1985) reappears. While we proceed independently of existing explicit work on $M(x)$ and $ψ(x)$, our method has an important step in common with work on another problem by (Ramana--Ramaré, 2020)."

    "abstract": "Protoplanetary disks observed in millimeter continuum and scattered light show a variety of substructures. Various physical processes in the disk could trigger such features -- one of which that has been previously theorized for passive disks is the thermal wave instability -- the flared disk may become unstable as directly illuminated regions puff up and cast shadows behind them. This would manifest as bright and dark rings, and a staircase-like structure in the disk optical surface. We provide a realistic radiation hydrodynamic model to test the limits of the thermal wave instability in irradiated disks. We carry out global axisymmetric 2D hydrostatic and dynamic simulations including radiation transport with frequency-dependent ray-traced irradiation and flux-limited diffusion (FLD). We found that starlight-driven shadows are most prominent in optically thick, slow cooling disks, shown by our models with high surface densities and dust-to-gas ratios of sub-micron grains of 0.01. We recover that thermal waves form and propagate inwards in the hydrostatic limit. In contrast, our hydrodynamic models show bumps and shadows within 30 au that converge to a quasi-steady state on several radiative diffusion timescales -- indicating a long-lived staircase structure. We find that existing thermal pressure bumps could produce and enhance this effect, forming secondary shadowing downstream. Hydrostatic models with self-consistent dust settling instead show a superheated dust irradiation absorption surface with a radially smooth temperature profile without staircases. We conclude that one can recover thermally induced flared-staircase structures in radiation hydrodynamic simulations of irradiated protoplanetary disks using flux-limited diffusion. We highlight the importance of modeling dust dynamics consistently to explain starlight-driven shadows."

However, its lossless, reactive power-agnostic model often yields dispatches that are infeasible under practical operating scenarios such as the nonlinear AC power flow (ACPF) equations. While theoretical analysis demonstrates that DCOPF solutions are inherently AC-infeasible, their widespread industry adoption suggests substantial practical utility. This paper develops a unified DCOPF-ACPF pipeline to recover AC feasible solutions from DCOPF-based dispatches. The pipeline uses four DCOPF variants and applies AC feasibility recovery using both distributed slack allocation and PV/PQ switching. The main objective is to identify the most effective pipeline for restoring AC feasibility. Evaluation across over 10,000 dispatch scenarios on various test cases demonstrates that the structured ACPF model yields solutions that satisfy both the ACPF equations, and all engineering inequality constraints. In a 13,659 bus case, the mean absolute error and cost differences between DCOPF and ACOPF are reduced by 75% and 93%, respectively, compared to conventional single slack bus methods. Under extreme loading conditions, the pipeline reduces inequality constraint violations by a factor of 3 to 5."

By leveraging both Euclidean and non-Euclidean transportation-related data, including traffic patterns, road users, and weather conditions, GNNs offer promising solutions for analyzing and enhancing VSN applications. The survey systematically categorizes and analyzes existing studies according to major VSN-related tasks, including traffic flow and trajectory prediction, traffic forecasting, signal control, driving assistance, routing problem, and connectivity management. It further provides quantitative insights and synthesizes key takeaways derived from the literature review. Additionally, the survey examines the available datasets and outlines open research directions needed to advance GNN-based VSN applications. The findings indicate that, although GNNs demonstrate strong potential for improving the accuracy, robustness, and real-time performances of on task-specific or sub-VSN graphs, there remains a notable absence of studies that model a complete, standalone VSN encompassing all functional components.

This work extends previous gluon-PDF extractions by performing a detailed analysis of key systematic effects, including gauge-link smearing, lattice spacing, pion mass, and nucleon boost momentum. The self-renormalization framework mitigates ultraviolet divergences associated with Wilson-line self-energy and renormalon contributions by combining lattice matrix elements with perturbative short-distance information, thereby preserving the correct infrared structure. Calculations are performed on $N_f=2+1+1$ HISQ ensembles generated by the MILC Collaboration at three lattice spacings and two pion masses, with boosted nucleon states reaching momenta up to 2.2~GeV. We determine renormalization factors from zero-momentum matrix elements and apply hybrid renormalization to suppress discretization artifacts. After extrapolating large-separation behavior and performing Fourier transforms, we reconstruct quasi-PDFs and match them to lightcone PDFs using next-to-leading order Wilson coefficients. Our results demonstrate that smearing and lattice-spacing effects are under control, and pion-mass and lattice-spacing dependence is mild relative to the current $O(10^6)$ statistics; however, momentum dependence remains a significant source of uncertainty. Future work including even larger boost momenta will be essential to reduce systematics in lattice determinations of the gluon PDF and to advance toward precision QCD phenomenology at the LHC and the future Electron-Ion Collider."

    "abstract": "Trained on massive cross-species DNA corpora, DNA large language models (LLMs) learn the fundamental \"grammar\" and evolutionary patterns of genomic sequences. This makes them powerful priors for DNA sequence modeling, particularly over long ranges. However, two major constraints hinder their use in practice: the quadratic computational cost of self-attention and the growing memory required for key-value (KV) caches during autoregressive decoding. These constraints force the use of heuristics such as fixed-window truncation or sliding windows, which compromise fidelity on ultra-long sequences by discarding distant information. We introduce FOCUS (Feature-Oriented Compression for Ultra-long Self-attention), a progressive context-compression module that can be plugged into pretrained DNA LLMs. FOCUS combines the established k-mer representation in genomics with learnable hierarchical compression: it inserts summary tokens at k-mer granularity and progressively compresses attention key and value activations across multiple Transformer layers, retaining only the summary KV states across windows while discarding ordinary-token KV. A shared-boundary windowing scheme yields a stationary cross-window interface that propagates long-range information with minimal loss. We validate FOCUS on an Evo-2-based DNA LLM fine-tuned on GRCh38 chromosome 1 with self-supervised training and randomized compression schedules to promote robustness across compression ratios. On held-out human chromosomes, FOCUS achieves near-lossless fidelity: compressing a 1 kb context into only 10 summary tokens (about 100x) shifts the average per-nucleotide probability by only about 0.0004. Compared to a baseline without compression, FOCUS reduces KV-cache memory and converts effective inference scaling from O(N^2) to near-linear O(N), enabling about 100x longer inference windows on commodity GPUs with near-lossless fidelity."

    "abstract": "Primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) is a common prediction of a wide class of inflationary models. Equilateral-type PNG, generically predicted by single-field inflationary models with higher-derivative interactions, imprints subtle but measurable signatures on the large-scale distribution of matter. An important parameter of these imprints is the PNG-induced bias coefficient $b_ψ$, which quantifies how the abundance and clustering of dark matter halos and galaxies respond to mode coupling in the initial conditions. Measuring $b_ψ$ is important for constraining equilateral PNG, yet it is notoriously challenging due to its degeneracy with Gaussian scale-dependent bias contributions. In this work, we present the first precision measurements of equilateral $b_ψ$ for dark matter halos using effective field theory at the field level. We show that this approach disentangles PNG effects from those of the Gaussian bias by virtue of noise variance cancellation. We compare our results with the phenomenological predictions based on the Peak-Background Split model, finding some agreement at the qualitative level on the redshift and mass dependence, but poor agreement at the quantitative level. We present a fitting formula for $b_ψ$ as a function of the linear bias, which can be used to set priors in PNG searches with ongoing and future galaxy surveys."

    "abstract": "Annotation bias in NLP datasets remains a major challenge for developing multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in culturally diverse settings. Bias from task framing, annotator subjectivity, and cultural mismatches can distort model outputs and exacerbate social harms. We propose a comprehensive framework for understanding annotation bias, distinguishing among instruction bias, annotator bias, and contextual and cultural bias. We review detection methods (including inter-annotator agreement, model disagreement, and metadata analysis) and highlight emerging techniques such as multilingual model divergence and cultural inference. We further outline proactive and reactive mitigation strategies, including diverse annotator recruitment, iterative guideline refinement, and post-hoc model adjustments. Our contributions include: (1) a typology of annotation bias; (2) a synthesis of detection metrics; (3) an ensemble-based bias mitigation approach adapted for multilingual settings, and (4) an ethical analysis of annotation processes. Together, these insights aim to inform more equitable and culturally grounded annotation pipelines for LLMs."

    "abstract": "In forensic craniofacial identification and in many biomedical applications, craniometric landmarks are important. Traditional methods for locating landmarks are time-consuming and require specialized knowledge and expertise. Current methods utilize superimposition and deep learning-based methods that employ automatic annotation of landmarks. However, these methods are not reliable due to insufficient large-scale validation studies. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework Cranio-ID: First, an automatic annotation of landmarks on 2D skulls (which are X-ray scans of faces) with their respective optical images using our trained YOLO-pose models. Second, cross-modal matching by formulating these landmarks into graph representations and then finding semantic correspondence between graphs of these two modalities using cross-attention and optimal transport framework. Our proposed framework is validated on the S2F and CUHK datasets (CUHK dataset resembles with S2F dataset). Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, which demonstrates significant improvements in both reliability and accuracy, as well as its effectiveness in cross-domain skull-to-face and sketch-to-face matching in forensic science."

    "abstract": "Many living organisms can exploit quantum mechanical effects to gain distinct biological advantages. In plants, photosynthesis uses quantum coherence to achieve near 100% efficiency in energy transfer. With advances in experimental techniques, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy can reveal dynamic processes such as coherence and coupling within a system, and it plays an important role in studying energy transfer in photosynthesis. On the theory side, methods such as the generalized Bloch-Redfield theory and the hierarchical equations of motion are used to model photosynthetic systems. Quantum simulation, as a high-efficiency and low-complexity approach, has also made progress across various platforms in the study of photosynthesis. In recent years, a series of studies has introduced quantum coherence into artificial systems to enhance energy transfer efficiency, laying the groundwork for the design of coherent devices with efficient energy transport. Birds can use the weak geomagnetic field and spin-dependent chemical reactions to detect direction. Theoretical frameworks for animal navigation include magnetite-based mechanisms, magnetoreceptor genes, and the radical-pair mechanism. Quantum simulations of navigation have also advanced on multiple platforms. Inspired by animal navigation, diverse quantum effects have been applied to improve sensing and to support navigation tasks. This paper presents a comprehensive review of progress on quantum coherence in photosynthesis and avian navigation, along with related theoretical methods, quantum simulation approaches, and research on quantum coherent devices."

Thermodynamic variables are treated as conjugate pairs of coordinates and momenta, allowing extensive and intensive quantities to be promoted to operators in a Hilbert space. The formalism is applied to the ideal gas, the van der Waals gas, and the photon gas, illustrating both first- and second-class quantization procedures. For the ideal gas, a Schrödinger-like equation emerges in which entropy plays the role of time, and the wave function acquires a phase determined by the internal energy. A pseudo-Hermitian framework restores Hermiticity of the temperature operator and establishes the equivalence among constraint realizations. The approach naturally leads to thermodynamic uncertainty relations and suggests extensions to quantum and topological phase transitions, as well as black-hole and non-equilibrium thermodynamics."

    "abstract": "In precision sports such as archery, athletes' performance depends on both biomechanical stability and psychological resilience. Traditional motion analysis systems are often expensive and intrusive, limiting their use in natural training environments. To address this limitation, we propose a machine learning-based multimodal framework that integrates wearable sensor data for simultaneous action recognition and stress estimation. Using a self-developed wrist-worn device equipped with an accelerometer and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, we collected synchronized motion and physiological data during real archery sessions. For motion recognition, we introduce a novel feature--Smoothed Differential Acceleration (SmoothDiff)--and employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to identify motion phases, achieving 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score. For stress estimation, we extract heart rate variability (HRV) features from PPG signals and apply a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, achieving 80% accuracy in distinguishing high- and low-stress levels. The proposed framework demonstrates that integrating motion and physiological sensing can provide meaningful insights into athletes' technical and mental states. This approach offers a foundation for developing intelligent, real-time feedback systems for training optimization in archery and other precision sports."

In the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrum, CHs appear as dark patches. Using daily hand-drawn maps from the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), we developed a semi-automated pipeline to digitize the SWPC maps into binary segmentation masks. The resulting masks constitute the CHASM-SWPC dataset, a high-quality dataset to train and test automated CH detection models, which is released with this paper. We developed CHASM (Coronal Hole Annotation using Semi-automatic Methods), a software tool for semi-automatic annotation that enables users to rapidly and accurately annotate SWPC maps. The CHASM tool enabled us to annotate 1,111 CH masks, comprising the CHASM-SWPC-1111 dataset. We then trained multiple CHRONNOS (Coronal Hole RecOgnition Neural Network Over multi-Spectral-data) architecture (Jarolim et al. 2021) neural networks using the CHASM-SWPC dataset and compared their performance. Training the CHRONNOS neural network on these data achieved an accuracy of 0.9805, a True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.6807, and an intersection-over-union (IoU) of 0.5668, which is higher than the original pretrained CHRONNOS model Jarolim et al.

    "abstract": "We propose FreeMusco, a motion-free framework that jointly learns latent representations and control policies for musculoskeletal characters. By leveraging the musculoskeletal model as a strong prior, our method enables energy-aware and morphology-adaptive locomotion to emerge without motion data. The framework generalizes across human, non-human, and synthetic morphologies, where distinct energy-efficient strategies naturally appear--for example, quadrupedal gaits in Chimanoid versus bipedal gaits in Humanoid. The latent space and corresponding control policy are constructed from scratch, without demonstration, and enable downstream tasks such as goal navigation and path following--representing, to our knowledge, the first motion-free method to provide such capabilities. FreeMusco learns diverse and physically plausible locomotion behaviors through model-based reinforcement learning, guided by the locomotion objective that combines control, balancing, and biomechanical terms. To better capture the periodic structure of natural gait, we introduce the temporally averaged loss formulation, which compares simulated and target states over a time window rather than on a per-frame basis. We further encourage behavioral diversity by randomizing target poses and energy levels during training, enabling locomotion to be flexibly modulated in both form and intensity at runtime. Together, these results demonstrate that versatile and adaptive locomotion control can emerge without motion capture, offering a new direction for simulating movement in characters where data collection is impractical or impossible."

Nonetheless, simulation is critical to the success of the field and a requirement for algorithm development and validation, as well as hardware design. GPU-acceleration has become standard practice for simulation, and due to the exponential scaling inherent in classical methods, multi-GPU simulation can be required to achieve representative system sizes. In this case, inter-GPU communications can bottleneck performance. In this work, we present the introduction of MPI into the QED-C Application-Oriented Benchmarks to facilitate benchmarking on HPC systems. We review the advances in interconnect technology and the APIs for multi-GPU communication. We benchmark using a variety of interconnect paths, including the recent NVIDIA Grace Blackwell NVL72 architecture that represents the first product to expand high-bandwidth GPU-specialized interconnects across multiple nodes. We show that while improvements to GPU architecture have led to speedups of over 4.5X across the last few generations of GPUs, advances in interconnect performance have had a larger impact with over 16X performance improvements in time to solution for multi-GPU simulations."

    "abstract": "Persistent tensions in the Hubble constant (H0) and the matter clustering parameter (S8) motivate late-time new physics that suppresses structure growth without significantly altering the background expansion history of the LambdaCDM model. We study a class of dark-sector dynamics in which a scalar dark energy field, governed by a Z2-symmetric quartic potential, interacts with dark matter through Yukawa and portal couplings. When the matter density drops below a critical threshold, a cosmological spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism generates a time-dependent vacuum expectation value v(a) and activates an effective coupling eta(a). This creates a symmetric phase (a <= ac) identical to LambdaCDM at early times, and a broken phase (a > ac) in which eta(a) > 0 transfers energy from dark matter to dark energy, suppressing linear structure growth. Using RSD, BAO, cosmic chronometers, Pantheon+SH0ES supernovae, and compressed Planck distance priors, we compare a fixed LambdaCDM background with a self-consistent coupled-scalar evolution. The RSD-only analysis shows a strong shift: the dynamical background gives Omega_m ~ 0.31 +/- 0.10 and sigma8,0 ~ 0.59 +/- 0.01, while the fixed-background case gives Omega_m ~ 0.20 +/- 0.09 and sigma8,0 ~ 0.75 +/- 0.05. In the full joint fit, we obtain Omega_m = 0.29 +/- 0.01, H0 = 69.7 +/- 0.6 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, and sigma8,0 = 0.78 +/- 0.01. A late-time interaction triggered by spontaneous symmetry breaking can therefore damp structure growth and ease the S8 tension while leaving the expansion history and the inferred H0 essentially unchanged, suggesting distinct physical origins for the two tensions."

A recent study in ICLR demonstrated that crafting large perturbations can shift inputs far into regions capable of generating a certificate for an incorrect class. Our study investigates if perturbations needed to cause a misclassification and yet coax a certified model into issuing a deceptive, large robustness radius for a target class can still be made small and imperceptible. We explore the idea of region-focused adversarial examples to craft imperceptible perturbations, spoof certificates and achieve certification radii larger than the source class ghost certificates. Extensive evaluations with the ImageNet demonstrate the ability to effectively bypass state-of-the-art certified defenses such as Densepure.

We employ the communication matrix formalism where the measurement statistics of a prepare-and-measure scenario is represented as a stochastic communication matrix. In order to differentiate between any two quantum channels, the informational completeness of the set-up is both necessary and sufficient. On the other hand, if we want to uniquely characterize any quantum channel, in addition we also need to have a complete description of the set-up. We show that in many important cases we can deduce this information directly from the communication matrix of the set-up before applying the channel. Given that we trust the dimension of the system, we show that we can deduce the information completeness of the set-up directly from the rank of the communication matrix. Furthermore, we show that another quantity of the communication matrix, called the information storability, can be used to self-test the set-up (up to unitary or antiunitary freedom) for an important class of states and measurements. This provides us a semi-device-independent way to identify quantum channels from the prepare-and-measure statistics. Lastly, we consider scenarios where we might have some additional information about the channels or additional resources at our disposal which could help us relax some of the assumptions of the proposed scenario."

By incorporating the power dynamics of OWF and HVDC during frequency disturbance, the traditional SFR model is extended to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of HVDC-connected OWF to onshore grid frequency dynamics. Furthermore, the control parameters to provide frequency support are optimally designed based on the extended SFR model by considering constraints on wind turbine power variation and DC voltage fluctuation. Compared to the works relying on detailed simulations, the salient novelty of the paper lies in the fast and accurate system performance analysis and control parameter design, ensuring efficiency and practicality for real-world applications. Comprehensive case studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC and the MATLAB/SIMULINK platforms demonstrate that the system frequency response characteristics can be evaluated accurately and improved significantly while satisfying the operational constraints."

    "abstract": "This study proposes a roadside unit (RSU)-enabled autonomous driving framework addressing occlusion challenges through global state awareness and dynamic resource co-optimization. The methodology resolves two interconnected problems: (1) navigation reliability degradation caused by occluded road users, and (2) communication resource allocation inefficiency in high-mobility vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks. A three-tier technical architecture is developed: (a) RSU-assisted environmental state estimation that fuses infrastructure-side perception with vehicular status to mitigate occlusion-induced uncertainty, (b) joint communication-planning optimization via a differentiable end-to-end framework, unifying motion control and resource allocation decisions, and (c) distributed motion planning with latency-aware safety verification, ensuring real-time feasibility through edge-assisted pipeline optimization. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance in occlusion-rich scenarios compared to existing V2X-dependent approaches, achieving balanced improvement in task completion rates and communication overhead reduction. The framework maintains operational robustness under varying traffic densities while ensuring real-time computational feasibility through edge-assisted pipeline optimization."

QFN, a leadless package, is an ideal choice for applications where size, weight thermal and electrical characteristics are critical, particularly in mobile and handheld devices. Applications like automotive, defense and high current circuits require the package to be mounted on thick printed circuit boards (PCB). The motivation of this work is to understand the effect of design variations of solder joints affecting reliability and optimize the solder package to improve reliability for application on different PCBs. Initially, the material properties of the PCBs were determined using Thermal Mechanical Analyzer (TMA), Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer (DMA). The PCBs were then cross sectioned to find the layer composition and Copper content in the boards. Different designs of solder joints were made using ANSYS Space Claim. The quarter models of boards with the different solder designs were then subjected to Accelerated Thermal Cycling Tests, to study stresses generated on the solder joints and variation in Plastic work. A comparative study was performed on obtained results for different solder designs and on different PCB boards to propose the optimum solder design to reduce solder damage and increased life in QFN assemblies."

Yet, many conventional stroke rehabilitation methods tend to overlook this crucial element, focusing primarily on repetitive, individual exercises. These may lead to disengagement, reduced motivation, and slower recovery, highlighting the need for more socially enriched rehabilitation approaches. This work proposes a collection of multi-user eXtended Reality (XR) serious games designed to assist stroke rehabilitation. Developed with guidance from healthcare professionals using a Human-Centered Design (HCD) methodology, the games promote physical and cognitive recovery while emphasizing social interaction among stroke survivors. By dynamically transitioning between immersive to augmented environments (i.e., Virtual to Augmented Reality (VR/AR) and vice-versa), the games used offer a stimulating experience. Initial findings confirmed the functionality and user acceptance of the games, with participants responding positively to the engaging nature and social aspects, offering valuable feedback to guide future enhancements."

    "abstract": "To meet the health management requirements of aerospace missions and considering the operating characteristics of Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) under computational resource constraints, this paper proposes a remaining useful life (RUL) prediction method based on the integration of a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The GRU is employed to model the temporal evolution of device operating features and predict degradation trends, while the VAE performs latent-space modeling and reconstruction-error quantification of degradation states, thereby enabling both quantitative RUL estimation and uncertainty characterization. In degradation trend prediction, the GRU is compared with the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The results show that the GRU significantly outperforms EKF in accuracy and achieves performance comparable to LSTM, while requiring only about three-quarters of the parameters and slightly higher inference speed, highlighting its lightweight nature. By combining historical operating data with GRU predictions, the VAE effectively captures latent features of the degradation process and quantifies the degree of degradation through reconstruction error, thus enabling robust RUL estimation with uncertainty analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight neural network achieves a root-mean-square error below 0.003 for degradation prediction and an average error of less than 10% for RUL estimation. The model consistently tracks the overall degradation trend and maintains high accuracy with minimal computational overhead, indicating strong potential for deployment in resource-constrained end devices."

The strained Si layers are formed by the amalgamation of a 2% Ge mole fraction into the unstrained or intrinsic Si layer. The induced strain significantly enhances the effective-mobility of the electron which plays a vital role in the device's performance.

    "abstract": "The electrification of aircraft represents a viable approach to achieving decarbonization in the aviation sector. In substituting combustion-driven propulsion systems, an increased required power-to-weight ratio and high fault-tolerance expectations challenge this transition. The environmental conditions in 6000 m, the high required power density, and the high required reliability challenge the heat sink design. Most failure mechanisms in the field of power electronics are temperature-dependent. Nevertheless, the heat sink weight and the available hydraulic power limit design factors. Thus, effective cooling strengthens the reliability of power electronics and increases aircraft safety. With the help of additive manufacturing (AM) and genetic algorithms (GA), a compromise can be found between heat transfer, pressure drop, weight, and temperature spreading. How does such an additively manufactured heat sink perform compared to well-established baseplate (BP) designs based on Pin Fins or jet impingement? Can a genetic algorithm optimize an entire BP close to the application? This investigation uses a genetic optimization approach of a triply periodic minimal surface structure. A multi-criteria optimization finds the optimal BP design based on the mentioned objectives. A proof of concept is presented by discussing the feasibility of BP design for a two-level and three-level module."

    "abstract": "Recently, the Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are emerging as an important tool for neurorehabilitation, cognitive monitoring and human-machine interaction where the multimodal integration of neural signals improves system robustness. Among these available modalities, the Electroencephalography (EEG) provides high temporal resolution while functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) captures complementary hemodynamic responses. However, the existing methods often depends on decision-level fusion which fails to fully exploit the deep cross-modal relationships between EEG and fNIRS. Hence, this research proposes Crossattention Transformer-based Fusion Framework (CTFF) for more effective multimodal representation. Initially, the input data is collected from EEG-fNIRS dataset which contains synchronized multimodal brain data. Then, the collected data is preprocessed with Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Band-Pass Filter (BPF) to remove non-neural artifacts and isolate task-related signals respectively. Further, the modalityspecific encoders are trained with contrastive pretraining to learn robust latent embeddings and align modalities in a shared space. After that, an intermediate fusion stage employs a crossattention transformer to capture temporal dependencies and nonlinear interactions across modalities. Finally, the pooled fused features are classified through a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with auxiliary losses for generalization and uncertainty estimation. The proposed CTFF achieved better results in terms of accuracy (99.89 %) than existing Schizophrenia Diagnosis Framework (Schizo-Net) model."

Using the traditional carrier cascade modulation strategy to control the floating capacitor will lead to a sudden change in the floating capacitor voltage at the carrier junction. Although the carrier overlap modulation strategy can solve the problem of levitated capacitor voltage jumping, its control strategy will increase harmonics in the output voltage and current. Given the above issues, this paper optimizes the carrier overlapping method to inhibit the jumping of the floating capacitor voltage at the carrier junction without increasing the harmonics of the output voltage and current significantly. In this paper, the theoretical feasibility of the scheme is verified by simulation, after which an experimental platform is built. The simulation and experiment results prove that the capacitor voltage fluctuation of this scheme is reduced by 38% compared with the carrier cascade, which indicates that this scheme has a particular engineering value."

    "abstract": "Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a key imaging technique in clinical practice offering unique functional insights. However, its broader applicability is limited by radiation exposure and lengthy scan times, and reducing either degrades image quality by increasing noise. Over recent years, U-Net-based convolutional neural networks have become dominant approaches for PET denoising. These methods show good performance in denoising, but they offer limited uncertainty handling due to their deterministic nature and are prone to oversmoothing. This paper critically evaluates the applicability of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) for low-dose PET image denoising, particularly when training data is limited. We adapted a conditional DDPM architecture to the PET context and compared its performance to a U-Net baseline on clinical PET data. The conditional DDPM was both deployed as a standalone method and in a hybrid-ensemble format where it was placed in series with the baseline U-Net. The conditional DDPM, while promising in theory, introduced unrealistic features in some outputs and was computationally intensive. The hybrid model, intended to combine both strengths, underperformed due to high sample variability in DDPM outputs. Contrary to recent studies suggesting DDPM superiority, our experiments demonstrate that DDPMs underperform relative to U-Net, showing inferior PSNR and SSIM and introducing notable artifacts. Our findings highlight the importance of training dataset size and quality for DDPM effectiveness and provide practical guidelines regarding the trustworthiness of diffusion models for clinical PET denoising."

The system undergoes evaluation through benchmarking that matches traditional ACO and alternative optimization algorithms while showing maximal accuracy levels and excellent adaptability features and computational efficiency outcomes. Real-life applications of the fuzzy logic-based ACO system are demonstrated in logistics as well as healthcare and IoT-based decision systems and these applications show its feasibility at different scales. Experimental tests validate that fuzzy logicbased advancements in ACO promote outstanding results in highly complex situations combined with dynamic problem spaces. The research demonstrates how combinatorial AI methods can autonomously learn while optimizing real-time operations which creates the foundation for future AI-driven choice systems across multiple industrial sectors."

    "abstract": "The smart skin antenna integrates with the carrier height, and polarization provides refined recognition capabilities, both of which combine to achieve maximum aperture and improved degrees of freedom. However, the beam performance of skin antenna depends on strain measurement data, and real-time monitoring will introduce errors, causing steering vector mismatches that degrade beam performance and polarization accuracy. To address this challenge, an online optimization method is proposed to achieve robust polarized beamforming in smart skin antenna array. The strain measurement data is used to develop a reconfigurable antenna model online via the modal method. Building on this foundation, the improved feature subspace (IFS) method estimates the actual steering vector in real-time. The estimated steering vector is then integrated with second-order cone programming (SOCP) algorithm to achieve online optimal robust polarized beamforming for smart skin array. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method not only enables real-time reconstruction of the optimal robust polarized beamforming but also significantly improves the overall performance of the smart skin array. The optimizations in beamwidth, pattern gain, and polarization matching exceed those of previous studies, highlighting the engineering potential of smart skin arrays in robust polarized beamforming."

    "abstract": "Electric vehicle (EV) cluster virtual energy storage (VES) participates in grid dispatch through aggregators. However, due to the stochastic characteristics of EV mobility, the VES of each cluster struggles to fully respond to the aggregators’ reference power setpoints. To address the deviation between the VES response power of each cluster and the aggregators’ reference power commands, this paper proposes a dual-layer dispatch command deviation mitigation strategy for photovoltaic-storage charging stations. Based on the number and parameters of in-service EVs, a quantifiable model of VES deviation mitigation capacity is established to evaluate the local EV cluster’s VES deviation management capacity. Subsequently, a local deviation mitigation strategy is proposed. To tackle residual deviations after local regulation, cross-cluster coordinated deviation mitigation and dynamic adjustment strategies are proposed, enabling full utilization of multi-cluster VES resources. Simulation results show that the proposed method effectively reduces dispatch command execution deviations, enhances the aggregators’ economic benefits, and ensures the safe and stable operation of the distribution network."

This study analyses the physiological and subjective responses of participants when exposed to immersive safety training content using a VR headset and a desktop computer monitor. Sixteen students voluntarily participated in the experiment. Participants viewed three videos on occupational safety which were created for the purpose of safety training. Their HR (Heart Rate) and HRV (Heart Rate Variability) were measured before, during, and after the training. SDNN (Standard Deviation of NN Intervals) and RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences) were observed as the primary HRV data. Questionnaires were used to collect subjective responses. During and after training, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding HR and RMSSD. The VR training video significantly increased the trainees’ SDNN values compared to the video presented on a computer monitor. Immersive training experiences resulted in higher levels of stress and emotional involvement. As compared to traditional training, VR training was easier to comprehend, more effective, and more satisfying for trainees. This study shows the possibility of VR-based occupational safety training."

    "abstract": "Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) is widely used as an imaging solution to aid diagnosis and other clinical tasks. However, this comes at the price of a deterioration in image quality due to the low dose of radiation used to reduce the risk of secondary cancer development. While some efficient methods have been proposed to enhance LDCT quality, many overestimate noise and perform excessive smoothing, leading to a loss of critical details. In this paper, we introduce D-PerceptCT, a novel architecture inspired by key principles of the Human Visual System (HVS) to enhance LDCT images. The objective is to guide the model to enhance or preserve perceptually relevant features, thereby providing radiologists with CT images where critical anatomical structures and fine pathological details are perceptually visible. D-PerceptCT consists of two main blocks: 1) a Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex), which integrates semantic priors from a pretrained DINOv2 model with local spatial features, allowing the network to incorporate semantic-awareness during enhancement; (2) a Global-Local State-Space block that captures long-range information and multiscale features to preserve the important structures and fine details for diagnosis. In addition, we propose a novel deep perceptual loss, designated as the Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF), which is inspired by human contrast sensitivity, to further emphasize perceptually important features. Extensive experiments on the Mayo2016 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of D-PerceptCT method for LDCT enhancement, showing better preservation of structural and textural information within LDCT images compared to SOTA methods."

Effective evaluation of generated motion requires metrics that capture realism, accuracy, and diversity. Existing approaches tend to overemphasize similarity to ground truth, assume Gaussian distributions, ignore temporal structure, or rely heavily on subjective assessments. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel evaluation method based on Conditional Glow Normalizing Flows, which model the full data distribution without assuming gaussianity and without requiring paired reference samples. Trained on two contrasting datasets, AMASS, which contains high-fidelity motion capture performed by real actors, and Mixamo, a synthetic dataset with retargeted animations, our model provides exact likelihood estimates that quantify the degree to which a motion sequence aligns with real or synthetic distributions. This enables not just binary classification, but a nuanced evaluation of physical and kinematic plausibility. We conduct extensive experiments across several state-of-the-art generative models, demonstrating that our likelihood-based metric offers an interpreTable tool for motion validation."

To address these limitations, this paper presents AGDYOLO, a novel object detection framework empowered by Adaptive Group-wise Dynamics (AGD), designed to balance efficiency and robustness through adaptive feature learning. The framework integrates four key components: (1) a GhostNet-based lightweight backbone to minimize model size and computational cost; (2) an Adaptive Down-Sampling (ADS) module to preserve fine-grained spatial details for detecting small waste items; (3) multi-scale Receptive Field Block (RFB) modules in the neck to enhance contextual discrimination among visually similar categories; and (4) ODConv-enabled dynamic heads that adaptively capture shape variations in irregularly shaped objects. A large-scale waste dataset is constructed, comprising 4,800 highresolution images across 60 fine-grained classes, with detailed annotations for occlusion level, object size, and deformation degree. Extensive ablation studies and cross-dataset validation on TrashNet and TACO demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the AGD framework. Experimental results show that AGD-YOLO achieves 83.2% mAP@50 with only 7.1 M parameters and runs at 165 FPS on an RTX 4060 Ti 16 G, outperforming YOLOv8 by +6.9% in mAP and reducing misclassification rates by up to 46% in heavily occluded scenarios.

    "abstract": "The increasing computational, storage, and networking demands of modern data centers have led to escalating power densities, posing significant thermal management challenges. Air-cooled high-performance servers necessitate low air supply temperatures and elevated airflow rates, rendering air cooling progressively inefficient beyond specific thermal design power (TDP) thresholds. Single-phase liquid immersion cooling (Sp-LIC) presents a viable alternative by leveraging the high thermal capacity and superior heat dissipation capabilities of dielectric fluids, which establish direct contact with all powered components. Additionally, Sp-LIC enhances system reliability by shielding IT hardware from environmental contaminants while reducing both capital expenditure (CapEx) and operational costs through the elimination of fans and air handling units. Unlike direct-to-chip liquid cooling, Sp-LIC obviates the need for intricate coolant distribution manifolds, as the dielectric fluid directly interfaces with all server components, making it particularly advantageous for hyperscale, edge, and modular data center deployments. This study investigates the thermal performance of single-phase immersion cooling under forced convection, wherein coolant flow is directed toward the heat sink. Performance is assessed across varying flow rates and power dissipation levels using three commercially available heat sink configurations: an aluminum heat sink, a copper heat sink, and an aluminum heat sink featuring a copper vapor chamber base. The coolant flow rate is varied between 1 and 8 LPM, while power dissipation ranges from 250 W to 900 W, with the fluid inlet temperature maintained at $40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. A Thermal Test Vehicle (TTV) replicating a server environment, inclusive of a motherboard and Dual Inline Memory Modules (DIMMs), is employed. Experimental measurements, including case temperature and pressure drop, are analyzed to evaluate system performance, with thermal resistance calculated for each heat sink configuration."

This paper considers the error functions to be minimized in designing a phase equalizer. This equalizer consists of cascaded allpass sections, which is called cascade-form allpass (CFAP) phase equalizer. We first derive the error of its frequency-response (FR), and then relate the FR-error with the phase-deviation of the CFAP phase equalizer. This paper proves that the absolute FR-error of the CFAP phase equalizer equals the absolute sine of half phase-deviation. This relation signifies that minimizing either the absolute FR-error or the absolute sine of half phase-deviation produces the same result. To demonstrate this equivalence, we simulate an example of designing the CFAP phase equalizer by utilizing both FR-error and sine of half phase-deviation. Simulation results confirm the mathematically proved error equivalence."

While previous research has established that users respond to personal space violations in VR similarly as in real-world settings, phase-specific physiological responses and the modulating effects of facial expressions remain understudied. We investigated physiological and subjective responses to personal space violations by virtual avatars, to understand how threatening facial expressions and interaction phases (approach vs. standing) influence these responses. Sixteen participants experienced a 2×2 factorial design manipulating Personal Space (intrusion vs. respect) and Facial Expression (neutral vs. angry) while we recorded skin conductance response (SCR), heart rate variability (HRV), and discomfort ratings. Personal space boundaries were individually calibrated using a stop-distance procedure. Results show that SCR responses are significantly higher during the standing phase compared to the approach phase when personal space was violated, indicating that prolonged proximity within personal space boundaries is more physiologically arousing than the approach itself. Angry facial expressions significantly reduced HRV, reflecting decreased parasympathetic activity, and increased discomfort ratings, but did not amplify SCR responses. These findings demonstrate that different physiological modalities capture distinct aspects of proxemic responses: SCR primarily reflects spatial boundary violations, while HRV responds to facial threat cues. Our results provide insights for developing comprehensive multi-modal assessments of social behavior in virtual environments and inform the design of more realistic avatar interactions."

    "abstract": "In-Mold Electronics (IME) offers transformative possibilities for the seamless integration of electronic circuits into diverse product forms and surfaces. Despite the advancements, there remains a significant gap in detailed research concerning the electrical characteristics of IME circuits, especially when subjected to thermal shock. This study seeks to address this research void by examining how thermal cycling affects the electrical performance of thermoformed substrates. The changes in electrical parameters of the circuit have been examined after first printing on the polycarbonate substrate using a screen printer and thermoforming over a mold designed for the door handle of a car when subjected to thermal cycling. The electrical performance of an RC oscillator circuit additively fabricated on a polycarbonate substrate with surface mount components has been examined and compared with a rigid FR4 board. Electrically conductive adhesive has been used to attach the components. The evolution of the circuit performance has been measured through thermal cycling, which is expected in automotive grade-3 applications."

Based on this scenario, this paper additionally considers the coordinate control and power flow interaction among the local weak ac grid, VSC-HVDC rectifier station and the renewable resources [represented by the commonly used grid-following (GFL) inverter]. By applying the frequency-following voltage-forming control method in the VSC-HVDC system and adding an outer active power balance control loop, the rectifier station can not only achieve the voltage supporting that to avoid the weak-grid instability of GFL inverter, but also realize the active power flow balance to determine how much power that comes from the renewable resources could flow into the HVDC system. A full-order state-space model is established to access the small-signal stability and the port admittance bode plot is also obtained accordingly to verify the voltage supporting performance. Two operating case studies are conducted to demonstrate the grid-strength improvement as well as the active power balance performance by this control method."

Firstly, the one-dimensional time-domain disturbance signal is converted into a two-dimensional visual image by using the Markov transfer field. After that, RepVGG extracts the disturbance features covered in the image from the sample set by itself. At the same time, in order to improve its feature extraction ability, the atrous spatial pyramid pooling module is introduced. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy can effectively overcome the shortcomings of traditional methods such as strong subjectivity and poor anti-noise performance in the case of no noise and signal-to-noise ratio of 30dB and 20dB, and has a high recognition rate for composite PQD."

    "abstract": "Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are lightweight hardware security primitives suitable for resource-constrained Internet of Things(IoT) devices. The Arbiter PUF (APUF), as a classic strong PUF structure, is well-suited for lightweight device authentication. Unfortunately, due to certain structural characteristics, the classic APUF can be successfully modeled by various machine learning (ML) models with only a small number of CRP (Challenge-Response Pair) samples. To address this security issue, In this paper, we build upon the classic APUF structure by introducing a Chain Block Obfuscation(CBO) mechanism and a Markov obfuscation mechanism at the input and output stages, respectively. This approach demonstrates strong resistance against four machine learning models—logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategies (CMA-ES), and artificial neural networks (ANN)—while optimizing hardware resource usage by at least 53.4% compared to previous attack-resistant structures. Even with up to 2M CRPs for training, the prediction accuracy remains around 50%. Additionally, XOR, a widely adopted output obfuscation mechanism by many researchers, has limitations in output uniformity when the number of intra-chip parallel APUFs is small. Studies have shown that the uniqueness between intra-chip APUFs may not reach the ideal value of 50%. In such cases, especially when there are only two parallel APUFs in the circuit, the uniformity of the XOR output is affected by insufficient uniqueness. To address this issue, this paper proposes a MUX-based Markov output obfuscation mechanism. Experimental data on the Xilinx Artix-7 field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platform demonstrate that this mechanism exhibits strong robustness in uniformity compared to the traditional XOR output obfuscation, particularly when the number of intra-chip parallel APUFs is small."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a novel optimization design for multi-waveguide pinching-antenna systems, aiming to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) by jointly optimizing beamforming coefficients and antenna position. To handle the formulated non-convex problem, a gradient-based meta-learning joint optimization (GML-JO) algorithm is proposed. Specifically, the original problem is initially decomposed into two sub-problems of beamforming optimization and antenna position optimization through equivalent substitution. Then, the convex approximation methods are used to deal with the nonconvex constraints of sub-problems, and two sub-neural networks are constructed to calculate the sub-problems separately. Different from alternating optimization (AO), where two sub-problems are solved alternately and the solutions are influenced by the initial values, two sub-neural networks of proposed GML-JO with fixed channel coefficients are considered as local sub-tasks and the computation results are used to calculate the loss function of joint optimization. Finally, the parameters of sub-networks are updated using the average loss function over different sub-tasks and the solution that is robust to the initial value is obtained. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GML-JO algorithm achieves 5.6 bits/s/Hz WSR within 100 iterations, yielding a 32.7% performance enhancement over conventional AO with substantially reduced computational complexity. Moreover, the proposed GML-JO algorithm is robust to different choices of initialization and yields better performance compared with the existing optimization methods."

Considering reliability and thermal conductivity, state-of-the-art spacers were implemented as a buffer to lower the stress. This article introduced a spacer made of direct-plated copper (DPC) with vias to reduce the thermomechanical stresses in the DSC power module. The DPC-via-spacer (DVS) consists of AlN ceramic with close CTE to SiC devices and copper layers with stress-strain relieved edge design. Single-switch DSC modules with copper spacer, molybdenum spacer, and DVS were designed and fabricated. Simulation results showed that, at a power loss of 90W, the thermally induced strain at the most vulnerable solder layer of the module with the DVS was reduced by 80% compared to that of the module with the copper spacer. Compared with the Mo spacer, the junction temperature is reduced by 4% under a similar stress-strain behavior. Considering skin effect under 500MHz frequency, the electrical resistance of the DVS is 92.6% and 50.5% of that of the copper spacer and the Mo spacer, respectively. Power cycling test results showed that the lifetime of the modules with DVS is 50% and 20% longer than that of the modules with copper spacer and Mo spacer, respectively. The results prove that DVS can reduce the thermomechanical stress-strain on the solder layer and enhance the reliability of the power module."

The proposed framework employs a hybrid coupling strategy at its front-end, which integrates Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and LiDAR. As a consequence, GNSS Inertial Odometry (GIO) and Lidar Inertial Odometry (LIO) are created and these are crucial for achieving precise localization in real-time. The RGB-Height-Intensity descriptor is used to improve the precision of loop closure detection while maintaining search efficiency. This is achieved by integrating surface reflectance data from the LiDAR intensity channel and RGB data from camera images. Finally, in the back-end procedure of this framework, the accuracy of posture estimation is enhanced by the optimization of odometry and loop closure factors. Additionally, a framework of real-time localization and autonomous navigation is developed and implemented on a wheeled robot to verify the proposed real-time localization framework. The experimental results indicate the framework exhibited higher performance in off-road environments, where conventional localization techniques generally degrade."

    "abstract": "Ultrasonic through-metal communication is critical for many applications in industrial IoT (IIoT) environments but suffers from frequency-selective fading, requiring orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). Accurate channel estimation with minimal pilot overhead is essential for optimizing OFDM performance. Existing methods for estimating ultrasonic through-metal communication channel ignore the sparsity of the ultrasonic through-metal channel impulse response (CIR), leading to high pilot overhead, while sparse estimation algorithms fail to exploit the CIR’s structural features. Therefore, a periodic sparsity enhanced channel estimation method via improved block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL) for ultrasonic through-metal communication is proposed, which further improves the estimation accuracy and reduces the pilot overhead by integrating three key features of CIR—the periodic occurrence of echo blocks, their exponential attenuation, and their intrinsic waveform—into the Bayesian prior. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms standard BSBL in estimation accuracy while substantially reducing pilot overhead compared to conventional non-sparse techniques. This method not only enhances estimation precision but also improves spectral efficiency and link reliability in resource-constrained and harsh IIoT environments."

To balance computational accuracy and real-time solving performance, this paper proposes a high-dimensional multi-physics modeling approach coupling partial differential equations (PDEs)- multilevel cyclic iterative modeling framework (MCIMF) and Orthogonal List-Conjugate Gradient (OL-CG) modeling approach. Firstly, high-dimensional PDEs are utilized to describe the high-dimensional multi-physics coupling phenomena in fuel cells, thus ensuring model accuracy. Secondly, multilevel cyclic iterative modeling framework is developed to ensure the conservation of electric and fluid domain physical characteristics during the transformation of PDEs. Lastly, the OL-CG method efficiently and flexibly stores effective information in matrix using a linked storage structure and searches for numerical solutions along the gradient descent, thus the model real-time solving performance is enhanced. Validation on hardware platforms and commercial CFD shows strong fidelity: the gas-pressure distribution matches ANSYS Fluent with MAPEs of 0.009% at 155 kPa and 0.012% at 135 kPa. Moreover, at a grid size of 36480, the proposed OL-CG delivers 86.17% and 53.23% faster computation than the FS and FS-CG methods, respectively, demonstrating a favorable balance between accuracy and high-speed solving."

And improved the CatBoost model by introducing the Stacking method, constructing a structure based on XGBoost and CatBoost models. To improve the interpretability of the model and prevent overfitting, this paper adopts logistic regression as the binary model. In order to reduce the impact of data imbalance on the model, a weighted cross entropy loss function was also designed, and the XG CatBoost fusion model was ultimately optimized. In the model construction and experimental section, this article conducted empirical analysis on CatBoost, logistic regression, random forest, GBDT, XGBoost, and XG CatBoost models through five fold cross validation, using accuracy, AUC value, and KS value as evaluation criteria. The experimental results show that compared with a single model, CatBoost has higher accuracy in pre loan forecasting, and the XG CatBoost fusion model outperforms other models in terms of various indicators."

This indicates that although the same input power is applied to both water and nanofluids, the latter exhibits a lower $R e_{j}$ due to changes in fluid properties but demonstrates better performance in cooling the hot spot.

The ice-making performance shows little difference between medium and high delivery pressure scenarios, but is significantly lower than that under low delivery pressure. Under low delivery pressure conditions, the system can achieve a power output of 10,378 kW and an ice production rate of 100.3 kg/s.

LoF describes fully automated production settings without human operators, but to enable occasional human intervention, advanced solutions such as robotic arms controlled with Virtual Reality (VR) are proposed. The first user study examined haptic feedback influences on usability and efficiency in robotic teleoperation. Results show that haptic gloves (SenseGlove Nova 1) significantly influence user preferences and Task Completion Time (TCT) of a LoF User Interface (UI). While most of the 32 participants preferred the haptic glove, their 59% slower performance suggests conventional controllers may be more efficient in automated LoF tasks. The haptic glove achieved a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 77.5, while the controller scored significantly higher at 83.1, indicating both methods were highly usable, with the controller maintaining an advantage. The second study (six participants) investigated how different visual interaction techniques affect performance and efficiency using only the controller. Supplementary visualization (e.g., ray control or transparent overlay of future position) shows improved accuracy during operation, suggesting enhanced visualization positively impacts performance. The research contributes to remote LoF operation by (1) providing empirical evidence for the trade-off between haptic feedback and operational efficiency, (2) demonstrating that enhanced visualization techniques can improve accuracy by up to 9.8%, and (3) proposing a hybrid approach combining controller-based operation with selective haptic feedback for critical tasks in a LoF environment."

    "abstract": "In census data analysis, poverty is a critical focus due to it highlights disparities in economic growth across different living standards. Accurate and timely forecasting of poverty is a critical for local government aiming to anticipate and mitigate economic-related challenges. However, the chaotic nature of the economic growth is a large obstacle in the way of using it. Despite the chaotic structures and uncertainty, there are some predictive methods that have been developed for forwarding predictions. Researchers have developed statistical methods in order to minimize the error in guessing methods used to evaluate time series. Specifically, this paper aims to identify the suitable model among ARIMA, LSTM and Hybrid ARIMA-LSTM based on the period from 2013 to 2024 using U.S Census Bureau dataset and also evaluates the need for reliable poverty forecasting by comparing the performance of these models by using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Logistic Regression (LR) was applied first to identify the most influential factors determining poverty, since the dataset contains many variables that could impact poverty outcomes. Based on the evaluation results, the Hybrid model offers superior performance compared to the other tested models. It consistently maintains high predictive accuracy and achieves the lowest RMSE values even with a reduced set of features, thus optimizing both data utilization and computational efficiency. This highlights the Hybrid model’s flexibility and practicality advantage over both LSTM and ARIMA."

This reduces both the number of required calibration images and errors from unreliable depth data."

    "abstract": "As the demand for autonomous reconnaissance in urban environments grows, target loss occurs when multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs) encounter regions that are difficult to access since obstacles. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a multi-UAV cooperative target consensus detection strategy. A model related to the UAV's visual region and sensor coverage area is established, considering the line-of-sight (LoS) obstruction caused by obstacles in urban environments. Bayesian theory is applied to update the global probability map, by employing dynamic occupancy grids to represent the probability of target presence and integrating sensor data from UAVs. To enhance detection speed, a consensus-based information fusion algorithm with state predictor is incorporated. Furthermore, an objective function for trajectory optimization is constructed by integrating cumulative probability and detection cost. Different typical target scenarios are designed, and UAV positions are dynamically adjusted using an improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA) within a model predictive control framework. Then, an obstacle configuration mechanism is proposed: when at least one UAV avoids obstacles, a strict constraint mechanism is applied; otherwise, a fuzzy constraint mechanism is utilized. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

Further, AIP-LEAP is built on a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and incorporates an Structured Query Language (SQL) database for efficient management of student information, course materials, and interaction data. While personalized learning pathways are offered through a knowledge graph-based recommendations system. Moreover, the learning modules included in proposed AIP-LEAP uses multimedia content and gamification of tasks to increase engagement, and evaluates student performance in light of cognitive, behavioural, and affective dimensions holistically. Furthermore, refining the educational process through the inclusion of teacher and student feedback with statistical analysis is implemented in a continuous loop to develop and renew the content, recommendations, and assessments. Thus, experimental results shows that proposed AIP-LEAP enhances student motivation, student engagement, and the learning outcomes of students. Therefore, the proposed AIP-LEAP is a systematic, secure, expandable educational and information platform that adapts to modern educational contexts."

The main innovation of this algorithm lies in the use of a fractional calculus strategy to improve the position information update method of the bat algorithm, enabling the algorithm to comprehensively utilise historical information during the search process and adaptively adjust the weight of historical information to balance the algorithm's exploration and exploitation capabilities. Additionally, by integrating the Lévy flight mechanism, the bat algorithm is enabled to perform longdistance jumps during the search process, reducing redundant computations and overcoming the drawbacks of traditional bat algorithms, such as slow search speeds and a tendency to get stuck in local optima. Furthermore, an enhanced stepping mechanism is introduced into the firefly algorithm, dynamically allocating search permissions based on the relative brightness of fireflies. Through conditional judgments, the algorithm determines whether fireflies should adopt attraction-based movement or random exploration, further improving the smoothness of flight paths and enabling the algorithm to flexibly adapt to the complex obstacles in urban environments. Simulation results show that, compared with the single bat algorithm and firefly algorithm, the average planning path of the hybrid algorithm proposed in this paper is reduced by 19.8%, 17% and 30.6%, respectively. The average running time is shortened by 62.1%, 51.6% and 75.8%, respectively."

In this work, SPIC thermal efficiency is investigated using a 2 RU- 4 nodes 400 W dual CPU server in a 24 RU Green Revolution Cooling (GRC) rack. The test matrix consists of a baseline case and two flow augmentation methods developed inhouse by GRC. The results show that a thermal resistance (die-toliquid) of $0.142 \\mathrm{C} / \\mathrm{W}$ can be achieved without any modification to the test setup and can be further reduced to $0.090 \\mathrm{C} / \\mathrm{W}$ using GRC’s flow augmentation methods. The present work reports die-to-liquid thermal resistance obtained from server manufacturer thermal utility instead of the more widely used case-to-liquid thermal resistance which is a significantly lower value. The flow augmentation methods presented here can be readily implemented in the data centers without the need for major modifications to the current setup. To further enhance thermal performance, Intel Corporation’s directed flow heat sinks are deployed in GRC’s immersed direct liquid cooling (iDLC) architecture. The results show that these heat sinks can reduce thermal resistance (case-toliquid) to below $0.020 \\mathrm{C} / \\mathrm{W}$. It should be noted here that the scope of this work is limited to flow enhancement through heat sinks. Higher TDPs can be achieved by optimizing heat sinks and TIM, using high-performance fluid, immersion-focused server design, and lower coolant temperatures."

To understand why accidents are more frequent in adverse weather, it is essential to examine how drivers redistribute their visual attention during emergency situations under different weather conditions, and how this redistribution differs depending on whether an accident occurs. To address this issue, we developed VR driving simulations that incorporate varying weather conditions and accident types integrated with eye-tracking. We analyzed gaze allocation from 50 participants across a 10-second window preceding a critical event, segmented into 1-second bins. Comparing successful and failed trials under both clear and adverse weather conditions, we identified significant differences in the timing of attention re-allocation based on task success and weather. Drivers who failed to complete the scenario fixated more on the forward view during the early and middle phases, with differences between the Pass and Fail groups emerging earlier under adverse weather conditions. Our findings highlight early imbalances in gaze behavior as potential indicators of successful hazard avoidance, which could contribute to the design of gaze-based driver assistance systems aimed at preventing accidents."

Therefore, the development of control methods must consider flexible joints. This paper proposes a robust tracking control method that accounts for uncertain variations in system parameters caused by flexible joints. An ideal model is established based on dynamic equations. A highly robust controller is designed to ensure that the error between actual signals and the ideal signals generated by the model converges to zero, thereby achieving the desired control performance. Furthermore, system stability analysis is conducted, demonstrating that the proposed control method satisfies system stability requirements.

The converter topology is presented, followed by the analysis of the output voltage and power as a composition of the rectifier and DC-DC converter voltages, as well as an analysis of partial power processing. Experimental results are obtained from a reducedscale prototype supplying a 2.8 kW electrolyzer, demonstrating its functionality under different operating points. The converter effectively met the power quality requirements of the electrolyzer, achieving low current and voltage ripple while processing at most 54.9% of the total power through the DC-DC converter. On the grid side, the power quality parameters were not satisfactory but remain consistent with the expected behavior of a six-pulse rectifier with a capacitive filter. Therefore, the proposed topology stands as a promising solution for electrolyzer power supply."

    "abstract": "Accurate photovoltaic (PV) energy yield estimation is essential for feasibility assessment, operational planning, and risk analysis. However, conventional approaches often fail to distinguish the appropriate use of Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) and Specific Meteorological Year (SMY) datasets across different stages of PV project design and operation. To address this gap, this work proposes a two-stage PV modeling methodology that relies exclusively on freely available satellite data and open-source tools. In the first stage, a TMY derived from the SARAH-3 dataset supports feasibility studies, while in the second stage, a SMY corresponding to the initial year of operation enables performance validation. The methodology is benchmarked against the commercial software PVsyst and validated with measured data from a 336.96 kWp rooftop PV system in São Paulo, Brazil. Results show that all configurations satisfied the statistical thresholds established for feasibility and operational analyses, with SMY-based simulations reducing monthly RMSE and MAE by more than 3 percentage points and shifting MBE by over 1.7 percentage points compared to TMY. These findings demonstrate the complementary role of TMY and SMY datasets, where TMY supports long-term feasibility assessments, and SMY provides accurate operational validation within a fully accessible and cost-free PV modeling framework."

We present a label-free sensor for sensitive detection of immunotherapeutic drugs in serum. We developed an extended gate sensor based on a single commercial field effect transistor (FET), reducing the cost of the overall device. The sensing component consists of an in-house fabricated chip of 32 gold electrodes on glass, which combined with the electronic multiplexing and readout modules, allows for simultaneous data acquisition. The sensor was utilized for detection of a bispecific molecule, called the Target Module (TM), a crucial component of the Universal CAR (UniCAR) system, a safer module of the adaptive CAR T-cell therapy. We utilized the sensor to screen TMs of different sizes through a versatile functionalized layer that resourcefully aims to minimize the Debye screening length effect. The detection of the TMs was achieved in buffer and serum at the femtomolar level, significantly below the limit of the standard colorimetric technique ELISA. Additionally, we utilized the same system to track the presence of the TMs in mouse serum over time. The recorded data showed an expected shorter half-life for the smaller TM (scFv TM 32 kDa) as compared to the bigger TM (IgG4 TM 112 kDa). These results were comparable with the radioactivity data circumventing the need for radioactive labelling. Overall, we demonstrate a promising application of low-cost, label-free, and accurate extended gate (EG)-FET biosensor for immunotherapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustment."

    "abstract": "In response to the problem of low accuracy in fault diagnosis of high-voltage circuit breakers with a single feature domain or single process signal, this paper proposes an SSA-SVM circuit breaker fault diagnosis method based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) fusion of closing and opening energy entropy and temporal characteristics. Firstly, the vibration signal is preprocessed using wavelet soft thresholding method; Secondly, in the time domain, collision specific points are determined based on the mechanism of circuit breaker closing and opening actions, and temporal characteristics are extracted as temporal characteristics quantities. In the time-frequency domain, VMD is used to decompose the closing and opening vibration signals, and the energy entropy of each intrinsic mode function (IMF) is obtained through Hilbert transform. The closing and opening energy entropy is fused with temporal characteristics as the feature vector for fault diagnosis; Finally, the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) is used to optimize the parameters of the support vector machine (SVM) and determine the optimal parameters for the fault diagnosis model. Taking LW30-126 circuit breaker with CT26 spring operating mechanism as the research object, 9 types of circuit breaker states were simulated, and different degrees of faults and coupling faults were set for the same fault type. The vibration signals during the closing and opening process were collected and feature vectors were extracted. The feature vectors were input into the SSA-SVM diagnostic model for fault classification. Experimental data showed that the fault recognition accuracy of our method reached 99.2%. Compared with single feature domain and single process signal features, our method has better performance in diagnosing circuit breaker fault types."

    "abstract": "The ASTM D5470 test method for the determination of thermal resistance and thermal conductivity of thermal interface materials (TIMs) is gaining broader industrial adoption, both during R&D efforts and in quality control. This test method assumes perfectly unidirectional heat flow from a heat source to a heat sink through two reference bars sandwiching a specimen. Perfect alignment and planarity are further assumed. The impact of deviations from this ideal scenario are studied here with the goal of guiding users on instrument use, maintenance and troubleshooting.This work quantifies, through modeling, the systematic errors introduced by: (1) imperfect reference bar insulation; (2) imperfect reference bar alignment; (3) imperfections in the reference bars due to wear; and (4) specimen overflow.High systematic errors in thermal resistance measurements are predicted in cases with reference bar tilt misalignment, reference bar angled face wear or specimen overflow, while reference bar shift misalignment and edge wear have smaller impact. Only specimen overflow is found to impact the determination of bulk thermal conductivity from resistance vs. thickness measurements. Experimental results validate the significant impact of specimen overflow and tilt misalignment. Caution with automated measurements of Type I materials is warranted, as are periodic parallelism checks."

These operations are supported by Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), which facilitate communication between infrastructure and automobiles. But as they are dynamic and decentralized, they are vulnerable to a range of security risks and unusual activity. Particularly in situations with limited data availability and high mobility, traditional rule-based or single layer machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated limited efficacy in detecting such intricate, dynamic threats. The recent developments in anomaly detection for VANETs are examined in this review, with an emphasis on hybrid model approaches that combine rule-based, machine learning, and deep learning methodologies. This paper also investigates the use of GenVRAM and other synthetic datasets, hierarchical detection architectures, and the efficiency of merging models at various network layers. For improved VANET security, the paper contrasts current methods, identifies important issues like latency and data scarcity, and suggests future directions like federated anomaly detection and adaptive learning."

The system enables the articulation of novel gestures to trigger novel interactions on-the-fly. Such a system can potentially enable more flexible experiences for users as the system can provide appropriate gesture interaction tools for specific contexts of use. However, to fully realize this vision requires tackling three challenges: (1) online gesture recognition; (2) the tradeoff between scene context and creative ambiguity; and (3) limitations of LLMs."

    "abstract": "The measurement of thermal impedance can be used to understand the thermal performance of a thermal management system (TMS) under transient thermal loads and can isolate the role of melting in a phase change composite (PCC) systems. Accurate measurement of thermal impedance under transient thermal loads of a heterogeneous media is critical for evaluating the thermal performance of complex systems, such as those encountered in power electronic devices. The study presents a systematic framework to measure and interpret thermal impedance in heterogeneous PCCs with varying operating conditions, including duty factor, on-time, heat flux, air temperature, and thermal loads. Various reference scenarios are examined to isolate the role of melting, and a framework for directly comparing experimentally determined thermal performance characteristics in TMSs was determined. Key concepts such as developing convergence criteria in experimental testing, defining appropriate factors within the uncertainty of the measurement, and identifying sources of variability are discussed. The results highlight that including a phase change within a TMS can induce a $0.11^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} \\cdot \\mathrm{W}^{-1}$ decrease in junction temperature at 10 s, with a decrease in junction temperature between 0.5 and 50 s. This work establishes a foundation for optimizing composite PCM-based TMS in nextgeneration power electronic systems."

However, existing systems mainly focus on either classroom engagement analysis or academic achievement independently, which leads to a lack of actionable and long-term career guidance. Hence, this study proposes a decision-support system based on Association Rule Mining (DSS-ARM) for student career planning. The proposed DSS-ARM integrates real-time classroom engagement, academic records, and student interest data to generate personalized and explainable career recommendations. Initially, input data were collected from classroom monitoring systems, academic databases, and student-provided surveys. Then, the data were preprocessed with data cleaning, integration, discretization, and encoding using median imputation, key-based join, equal-frequency binning, and one-hot encoding, respectively, to transform the raw data into a structured form for mining patterns. ARM then employs the Frequent Pattern Growth (FP-Growth) algorithm to identify meaningful patterns linking engagement and performance to potential career paths. Furthermore, rule validation and pruning use cross-validation and lift-based pruning to ensure interpretable rules. Finally, the rule-based DSS generates personalized recommendations and incorporates feedback for continuous system improvement. The proposed DSS-ARM established a higher accuracy (89.32%) than the existing Random Forest (RF) model."

It takes a certain amount of time to apply the thermal analysis results to the chip design. The previous paper, [1]\"Thermal Aware Floorplan Optimization of SOC” 2023 ITherm, explains a method where designers can immediately check the temperature characteristics based on floorplan placement and apply them to the design in real-time, using a thermal resistance matrix for internal chip areas without needing to request a simulation [2, 8]. An issue was discovered where the error between the Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD) simulation temperature data and the temperature data calculated using the Thermal Resistance Matrix(TRM) increased as the power in the scenario increased. As power increases, the airflow on the surface of the application accelerates, increasing convective heat transfer, which in turn reduces the junction-to-ambient thermal resistance compared to the initial state. This paper defines a range of power scenarios applicable in a mobile phone environment and analyzes the method of reducing errors by comparing the changes in thermal resistance in the chip’s floorplan areas."

This paper presents a novel mathematical regression approach that reduces CA measurement windows to under 1 second, significantly faster than previously reported methods, which typically require 1–4 seconds or longer. By applying an inference algorithm to the initial transient current response, this method accurately predicts steady-state electrochemical parameters without requiring additional hardware modifications. The approach is validated through comparison with standard chronoamperometric techniques and is demonstrated to maintain reasonable accuracy while dramatically reducing data acquisition time. The implications of this technique are explored in analytical chemistry, sensor technology, and battery science, where rapid electrochemical quantification is critical. Our technique is focused on enabling faster multiplexing of chronoamperometric measurements for rapid olfactory and electrochemical analysis."

Fourteen participants stroked their avatar’s arm under two conditions (Visual-Only, Visual-Tactile) and rated pleasantness. Results suggest participants with strong body ownership perceived pleasantness even in the Visual-Only condition. In contrast, those with weak ownership relied heavily on actual touch.

It is employed a series LC filter between the inverter and the grid in order to eliminate the de component of the grid current. In addition, the common ground connection allows an operation without leakage current due to the bypass of the PV parasite capacitance. Converter model and control strategy is provided as well simulation and experimental results. The proposed inverter is compared with conventional common-ground topologies in terms of semiconductor losses, total harmonic distortion of the grid current and number of components.

Interesting simulation results are presented and discussed to validate the proposed power and control structures."

    "abstract": "This work presents a prototype of a photovoltaic (PV) module characterizer based on the capacitive load method. The system is controlled by a Gate Driver circuit managed by an ESP32 microcontroller, which records voltage measurements during the capacitor charging process and calculates the corresponding current signal. Unlike conventional approaches that employ both current and voltage sensors, the proposed method uses only a voltage sensor. This not only reduces the overall cost and complexity of the equipment but also minimizes issues related to current sensor accuracy and noise, particularly at low sampling speeds. Additionally, the device is self-powered-requiring neither a battery nor an external power source-which makes it suitable for field applications. Experimental tests performed with a Jinko JJM330P module showed strong agreement between the results obtained from the characterizer and those measured using a reference oscilloscope."

UGC videos suffers from shakiness, due to unsTable cameras hold, and this has boosted the development of video stabilization algorithms. The development of evaluation metrics has received comparatively less attention, and the existing metrics do not address the challenges posed by shakiness distortions. To fill this gap, we propose a novel no-reference metric based on deep neural network to evaluate the perceptual quality of shakiness in UGC videos. We extract spatial and temporal features using SlowFast network reinforce them by integrating optical flow features obtained by the Inflated 3D ConvNet network. The attributes of the two networks were integrated and passed through regression layers to generate the final shakiness quality score, referred to as the SlowFast-Flow metric. Comprehensive experiments confirm that the SlowFast-Flow metric outperforms state-of-the-art. The codes of the SlowFast-Flow are available at https://github.com/dborhen/SlowFast_Flow_VQA.git"

    "abstract": "With the wide application of formal modelling methods in the testing of autonomous systems such as unmanned ground vehicles(UGVs), the use of formal modelling of UGVs and other autonomous systems to generate test cases has become an important means of improving the reliability of UGVs and other autonomous systems, and this method of generating test cases ensures that the generated test cases comprehensively cover the different testing requirements of the system. However, the generated test cases may contain redundant paths and test data, leading to inefficient testing and increased computational costs. Therefore, test case approximation becomes a necessary optimisation tool. In this paper, we propose a test case approximation method based on the combination of test paths and data. Firstly, by simplifying the redundant test paths generated by the state machine diagrams in the formal modelling of autonomous systems such as UGV, it ensures that the number of state transfers that can be covered by the simplified set of test paths is consistent with that covered by the original test paths, and avoids repetitive testing. Secondly, by optimising the test parameter space generated by the module definition graphs and test paths in the formal modelling of autonomous systems such as UGV, redundant test data are removed, thus reducing unnecessary computation. The approximation method proposed in this paper not only ensures the coverage and diversity of the original test cases, but also improves the execution efficiency of the tests, providing a new optimisation idea for the testing of autonomous unmanned systems."

In this paper, we present a new method based on Paillier's cryptosystem applied to images in order to perform homomorphic encryption, and compress them without loss of information. This allows us to reduce the size expansion between plain and encrypted messages, which by default is greater than 2 bits. Our method is based on an analysis of the random values of the parameter <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$r$</tex> of the cryptosystem, in order to find encrypted values whose least significant bits (LSB) are equal to 0. Then we exploit this by removing k LSB par block to compress the encrypted image. This method is fully reversible, as we just need to add the previously removed LSB during the decryption phase, thus recovering the original image without any loss to quality. Experimental results show that our method can be applied to color images with large pixel block sizes."

    "abstract": "The impact of defect configuration at die-attached solder joint on UV LED performance is studied by using Computation Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modeling. In this work, four types of solder joint void configurations are simulated: Type-I, A single large void located under the center of the die; Type- II, A single large void located under the corner of the LED die; TypeIII, multiple small voids with the same total area as Type-I and II void, but evenly distributed under the LED die; Type-IV, a single void located in one quadrant of the die. Simulation results show that for a given void size, type-II void causes the most significant hot spot, leading to the highest LED junction temperature ($\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{j}}$). Type-III void, on the other hand, demonstrates the lowest $\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathbf{j}}$. A further study of void configuration on LED reliability is conducted with respect to the widely used MIL-STD-883 in the microcircuit industry. It is concluded that LEDs demonstrate a similar lifetime as expected from the LED die manufacturers, under the condition that die-attach void levels meet the MIL-STD-883 standard, regardless the void types. This result suggests that MIL-STD-883 can be safely utilized for LED die-attach process qualification."

The proposed topology employs a four-leg converter, comprising a conventional three-leg shunt structure and an additional leg connected in series with one grid phase. This configuration enables both series and shunt compensation, ensuring stable grid integration with unity power factor, even under partial shading and nonlinear load conditions. In contrast to direct CHB-to-grid connections, the converter improves system reliability by mitigating phase imbalance, harmonic distortion, and voltage sags. The topology is also capable of isolating the PV system during grid disturbances and selectively delivering only active power to the grid while powering local nonlinear loads. These features make it a suitable interface for modern PV applications, where power quality and fault tolerance are critical."

    "abstract": "Jet impingement, enhanced by evaporation and boiling from a porous wick structure, has potential for dissipating high heat fluxes. This study investigates the enhancement of twophase jet impingement cooling using capillary-driven boiling and proposes a concept design to address the challenges associated with two-phase operation, including pressure fluctuations, surface temperature oscillations, and premature critical heat flux. A novel manifold design is proposed, featuring a three-path manifold with distributed liquid inlets, liquid outlets, and vapor outlets. The integration of porous wick structures on the surface increases the availability of nucleation sites that promote boiling and evaporation throughout the evaporator. Embedded tunnels within the wick facilitate liquid bypass to the liquid outlets and act as an integrated liquid reservoir for capillary wicking to the porous regions. Whereas vapor generated during boiling in the wick exits through dedicated vapor outlets to achieve phase-separation. The tunnel spacing is optimized to ensure a sufficient capillary wicking length in the wick structure to avoid dry out at high heat flux operation, even for low-surface-tension dielectric coolants used in electronics cooling. A reduced-order model was developed to assess the thermo-hydraulic performance of the proposed system under various flow rates and heat flux conditions, using R1233zd as the working fluid. The manifold and wick dimensions were designed to maintain a target pressure drop of 40 kPa and heat flux of $500 \\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$. This work demonstrates an energy-efficient, low-cost, and package-integrated two-phase jet impingement cooler optimized for minimal pressure drop and maximum thermal performance.

    "abstract": "Wearable technologies enhance the accuracy of health monitoring, but ensuring at the same time user comfort remains a significant challenge. Flexible strain sensors have emerged as promising candidates for this task, thanks to their ability to conform to the body and capture subtle biomechanical signals. Among these, sensors based on fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) offer advantages such as high sensitivity, flexibility, compactness, multiplexing capabilities, and immunity to electromagnetic interference. However, most FBG-based flexible sensors require external adhesives or fixations to maintain contact with the skin, which can limit comfort, usability, and reliability of collected data. This study introduces an innovative bilayer wearable (BW) sensor that integrates a single FBG within a stretchable silicone structure combined with a self-adhesive silicone layer. The device can be directly attached to the skin without any additional support, ensuring stable and comfortable wear even during motion. This work details the fabrication process and metrological characterization of the BW sensor exhibiting repeatable behavior under strain and low hysteresis across a wide range of traction speeds. Preliminary tests on healthy volunteers confirmed the sensor’s capability to be applied in biomedical scenarios ranging from vital signs monitoring to biomechanics. In particular, BW was able to accurately detect respiratory and heart rates, as well as joint movement and muscle contraction. The combination of soft adhesion and optical sensing performance makes the proposed BW sensor a promising tool for real-time, reliable health monitoring."

It is the first to derive the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB) on TOA estimation for OFDM signals containing both known pilot and unknown data resources. In comparison to the Cram´er-Rao bounds (CRBs) derived in prior work, this ZZB captures the low-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) thresholding effects in TOA estimation and accounts for an unknown carrier phase. The derived ZZB is evaluated against CRBs and empirical TOA error variances. It is then evaluated on signals with resource allocations optimized for pilot-only TOA estimation, quantifying the performance gain over the best-case pilot-only signal designs. Finally, the positioning accuracy of maximum-likelihood and decision-directed estimators is evaluated on simulated low-Earth-orbit non-terrestrial-network channels and compared against their respective ZZBs."

    "abstract": "Current image de-raining methods primarily learn from a limited dataset, leading to inadequate performance in varied real-world rainy conditions. To tackle this, we introduce a new framework that enables networks to progressively expand their de-raining knowledge base by tapping into a growing pool of datasets, significantly boosting their adaptability. Drawing inspiration from the human brain’s ability to continually absorb and generalize from ongoing experiences, our approach borrows the mechanism of the complementary learning system. Specifically, we first deploy generative adversarial networks (GANs) to capture and retain the unique features of new data, mirroring the hippocampus’s role in learning and memory. Then, the de-raining network is trained with both existing and GAN-synthesized data, mimicking the process of hippocampal replay and interleaved learning. Furthermore, we employ knowledge distillation with the replayed data to replicate the synergy between the neocortex’s activity patterns triggered by hippocampal replays and the preexisting neocortical knowledge. This comprehensive framework empowers the de-raining network to accumulate knowledge from various datasets, continually enhancing its performance on previously unseen rainy scenes. Our testing on three benchmark de-raining networks confirms the framework’s effectiveness. It not only facilitates continual knowledge accumulation across six datasets but also surpasses state-of-the-art methods in generalizing to new real-world scenarios.

However, many existing SCMLI topologies suffer from limited scalability caused by the large number of semiconductor devices, high voltage stress, severe inrush current, and high cost. This study aims to design and implement a single-source 11-level step-up inverter that significantly reduces the component count by employing only nine switches, four diodes, and four capacitors, while limiting the total standing voltage (TSV) to 5.4V<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">max</sub> and the inrush current to 4I<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">max</sub>. In the proposed method, a level-shifted modulation algorithm requires only six control signals, and an optimized capacitor charging/discharging sequence effectively reduces the longest discharge period (LDP), keeping the voltage ripple of each capacitor below 3.5%. The research methodology includes detailed modeling, analysis of voltage and current stresses, capacitor sizing, and loss evaluation through MATLAB/Simulink simulations, followed by the experimental validation of a 300 W laboratory prototype. Both simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed inverter achieves a voltage gain of 2.5, an output voltage THD of about 6.7%, and a peak efficiency of 98.39% at 300 W, with well-balanced stress distribution among semiconductor devices. A comparative study with recent SCMLI structures demonstrates that the proposed topology, while maintaining high efficiency, achieves the lowest TSV, the smallest number of components, and strong potential for extension to higher voltage and power levels."

However, the existing Neural Network Clustering Particle Swarm Optimization Routing (NNC-PSOR) faces suboptimal cluster head selection, lack of Quality of Service (QoS) awareness, and high randomness in routing, resulting in reduced efficiency in large-scale and dynamic IoT scenarios. This research proposed a Neural Network Clustering-Harris Hawks Optimization Multi Objective Routing (NNC-HHO-MOR) protocol. Initially, the environmental data and residual energy information is collected from the sensor nodes. Next, Neural Network based Clustering (NNC) is applied to form clusters of sensor nodes. Furthermore, Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) is employed for the selection of the most suitable cluster heads through a multi objective fitness function. Moreover, HHO is applied for QoS-aware routing from cluster heads to the sink, thereby optimizing the path, reliability, latency, and energy consumption. Finally, adaptive parameter tuning is applied to dynamically adjust the HHO search parameters based on the current network conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed NNC-HHO-MOR protocol improves the network lifetime with 97% accuracy and 98% energy consumption."

    "abstract": "Increased demand from AI/ML applications has led to a drastic rise in the thermal design power (TDP) of the latest GPUs, with chipsets exceeding 1000 W of heat dissipation. Traditional air-cooling technologies cannot efficiently cool these components at expected workloads and liquid cooling solutions have become necessary, especially to improve energy efficiency in datacenters. However, as chips become more power hungry, the limit of these cooling solutions will also be realized. Two-phase cooling offers higher heat transfer coefficients by utilizing the latent heat of vaporization as the fluid undergoes a phase change from liquid to vapor and thus provides an attractive approach for cooling higher power chips. The experiments reported here utilize two-phase flow boiling in high-aspect-ratio (20:1) copper microchannel heatsinks with $76 \\times 76 \\mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ footprint to cool power levels expected from some of the recently announced GPUs ($\\geq 1000 W$). A low global warming potential (GWP) refrigerant, R1233zd(E), is used as the working fluid, and the thermofluidic performance of the evaporators is investigated under different mass flow rates of 50, 60, 73, and $90 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{hr}$. Performance at each flow rate is characterized by measuring thermal resistance and pressure drops for heat loads ranging from 100 W to 1100 W while maintaining $1^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ inlet subcooling. The heatsinks demonstrate a total thermal resistance of $R_{\\theta} \\leq 0.0065 \\mathrm{~K} / \\mathrm{W}$ at $\\geq 1000 \\mathrm{~W}$ of total heat load. Such a low thermal resistance enables the capability of a high heat rejection and waste heat capture efficiencies as the working fluid can be supplied at ${71}^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, while maintaining a chip backside temperature of $\\leq \\mathbf{9 0}^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. In addition to the low thermal resistance, the heatsink demonstrates low pressure drop at high power ($\\leq 3 \\mathrm{kPa}$), making it an ideal candidate for pumpless cooling solutions."

This work proposes the development of a Diamond/Cu Alloy heat spreader by in-situ electroplating copper through diamond particles in the range of 10 to $100 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. The thermal conductivity and boundary conductance of diamond microparticles were investigated using time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR).

Measurements were performed on monocrystalline diamond particles of $\\sim 70 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ and $\\sim 20 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, examining thermal properties at the center and edge. While a significant decrease in thermal conductivity was observed as the measurement spot moved from the center to the edge-suggesting greater phonon scattering near boundaries-this suppression effect may also arise from the fact that the 2 D radial heat conduction model for the TDTR data fitting does not account for the finite geometry of the diamond particle. For $\\sim 70 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ and $\\sim 20 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$ particles, the thermal conductivity dropped by 38% and 53%, respectively.

The Driver Fatigue Dataset (DFD) was utilised, consisting of two categories: \"Drowsy\" and \"Non-Drowsy.\" Each category contains 9,200 labeled images, totaling 18,400 images. These were used to train and test machine learning models, enabling the system to differentiate between fatigued and normal states. Data preprocessing and feature extraction were applied to improve recognition of facial cues, while classification models were optimized to achieve prediction accuracy. The experimental results demonstrated that the system achieved performance with precise differentiation between drowsy and non-drowsy states, showing potential for real-world deployment. By reliably identifying signs of fatigue, the proposed system can serve as an assistive safety tool, alerting drivers before their drowsiness leads to impaired driving. The findings contribute to the broader goal of reducing accident rates caused by fatigue and improving road safety standards, particularly in regions where driver exhaustion is a significant concern."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a framework that integrates zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) to achieve the synergistic optimization of transaction privacy and trusted identity authentication. First, a pseudonymous transaction protocol based on zk-SNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge) is designed. The R1CS constraint system is used to construct a circuit that hides the transaction amount and address, resulting in a proof that takes up only 1.5 KB. Second, the W3C standard VC is introduced to enable off-chain identity attribute authentication. Users generate a “credential validity proof” using ZKPs and upload the proof along with the transaction to the chain. Finally, smart contracts verify the dual proofs, using Merkle tree aggregation to reduce verification overhead. An innovative “attribute-bound anonymous transaction” model is proposed to dynamically decouple transaction and identity attribute verification. Deployment on the Ethereum testnet demonstrates that this scheme reduces transaction correlation to approximately 0.3 %. Groth16 achieves a throughput of 142 transactions per second (TPS) in 798 ms at a scale of 200,000 gates."

    "abstract": "The resurgent era of lunar exploration is defined by a strategic shift from temporary visits to a sustained international and commercial presence, resulting in an unprecedented demand for a robust and continuously available communication infrastructure. The conventional direct-to-Earth communication architecture relies on limited and oversubscribed deep space networks, which are further challenged by the radiative environment and insufficient visibility in certain areas of the cislunar domain. We address these issues by proposing a foundational move toward inter-domain space network cooperation by introducing architectures based on near space networks. They can directly service lunar surface users or, via cislunar relays, by forming a resilient and multi-layered communication backbone. First, we establish a unified link analysis framework incorporating frequently disregarded environmental factors, such as the Moon's variable illumination, to provide a high-fidelity performance evaluation. Second, we assess architectures' reliability based on the outage risk, essential for quantifying the operational robustness of communication links. Finally, to manage the inherent dynamism of architectures, we propose an inter-domain space digital twin: a dynamic decision-making engine that performs real-time analysis to autonomously select the best communication path, ensuring high and stable reliability while simultaneously optimizing power consumption. Overall, our paper provides a holistic architectural and conceptual management framework, emphasizing the necessity of lunar communications to support a permanent human and economic foothold on the Moon."

The prototype built for laboratory testing was evaluated under different operating conditions, with variations in load and input voltage. Designed to operate at a nominal power of 250 W, the converter achieves an output voltage of 2500 V, efficiency of 90%, and current harmonic distortion of 4.45%."

Designed on an FR4 substrate the antenna employs a semi-elliptical ground plane to achieve wideband (3.5 GHz - 10.6 GHz) impedance matching. The performance of the antenna is elevated by introducing a circular parasitic patch, opposite to the radiating structure. The effect of the change in the shape of the parasitic patch is also studied and it is found that the circular parasitic patch provides the widest frequency coverage and stable gain in contrast to the hexagonal and rectangular parasitic patches. With a maximum realized gain of 4 dBi, the proposed antenna provides a space-efficient and high-performance solution for ultra-wideband (UWB) communication systems."

To address these issues, a multi-objective optimization model to enhance computational efficiency and flexibility in route planning based on the Distributed Breadth Convolutional Neural Network and Markov Decision Processes (M-DBCNN) is presented. Specifically, distributed width convolutional neural networks extend the width of convolutional neural network (CNN) to enhance the feature extraction of convolutional layers without increasing the depth of the network, and improve the computational efficiency of the network model in a distributed way. Subsequently, Markov decision process models the route planning problem by defining state space, action space and state transition probability, deals with uncertainty in the environment, and optimizes the decision with the help of reward function to find the optimal path strategy to meet a specific goal. Simulation experiments show that the proposed algorithm is able to find the optimal route under different complexity levels. Compared with other algorithms, in more complex environments, the proposed algorithm can effectively balance the efficiency and flexibility of route planning and find better routes."

In addition, it highlights the limitations of relying solely on linearized small-signal average models, especially under large-signal conditions with significant harmonic components. To overcome these shortcomings, the study adopts a Dynamic Phasor (DP) framework, enabling a more accurate representation of time-varying signals around the fundamental frequency. Nonlinear state-space equations are formulated to capture the frequency-dependent behavior, and the steady-state values are derived by equating the system to zero. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate that the DP model accurately predicts system dynamics and captures low-frequency ripple effects, offering improved insight compared to traditional averaged models."

TAPINTEL maps adversarial strategies within the MITRE ATT&CK framework, enabling automatic behavioral profiling. Experimental results reveal that the F1-score is 77 % on 14 tactics, with the Support Vector Machine obtaining the best performance (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{8 7 \\% F 1}$</tex>).

Based on the analysis of the influence mechanism of grid-side current imbalance, distortion and frequency deviation on the phase-locked loop(PLL), a three-phase SRF-PLL based on adaptive notch filter(ANF) is used to realize the accurate adaptive estimation and fast convergence of frequency and phase under the above complex conditions. The phase estimation information is used in real time for harmonic current extraction and Park transformation, and the frequency estimation information is used in real time for the VPI control module to overcome the problem of active power filter (APF) compensation performance degradation under frequency deviation conditions. The estimation performance of notch filter-based synchronous phase-locked loop (NF-PLL) and ANF-PLL under frequency deviation is compared and analyzed by simulation. The experimental results of APF compensation performance under weak power grid conditions show that the frequency adaptive PI + VPI control / ANF-PLL strategy has better frequency deviation adaptability than the frequency adaptive PI + VPI control / NF-PLL strategy."

Motivated by this challenge, we investigate abnormality detection on PET scans through the lens of large-scale foundation models and other pre-trained vision encoders, whose broad applicability has recently energised deep-learning research. We present the first systematic 2-D study that contrasts such pretrained backbones with traditional, task-specific architectures in both binary classification and semantic segmentation. For classification, embeddings were extracted from frozen encoders (DINOv2, RAD-DINO, ConvNeXt, etc.) and fed to a lightweight fully-connected head, while a traditional CNN provided the baseline. For segmentation, frozen pretrained encoders-both off-the-shelf and custom-built-are grafted onto the nud-Net pipeline, exploring information fusion at the bottleneck and across multiple feature levels. Experiments demonstrate that DINOv2-based embeddings achieve the most promising results in classification, surpassing the CNN baseline across all metrics while requiring only lightweight training once embeddings are harvested. For segmentation, plain nnU-Net remains superior, indicating that PET-specific fine-tuning of general-purpose encoders may be necessary. These findings chart the promise and current limits of foundation models for clinical PET analysis."

    "abstract": "Extreme weather events pose a growing threat to the operational safety and stability of electricity distribution grids. At the same time, the pressure on distribution grid operators to adapt their infrastructures to new technological, ecological and regulatory requirements in terms of sustainability is increasing. This paper presents an extended planning model that systematically integrates resilience and sustainability criteria. Resilience, in this context, is understood as the system’s ability to maintain or rapidly restore functionality under disruptive conditions, and is conceptually distinct from operational safety, which refers to normal, fault-free operating conditions. The analysis is carried out on two levels: the asset level and the grid structure level. Specific criteria for increasing resilience are identified, linked to sustainable planning approaches and made measurable using suitable key performance indicators (KPIs). The effectiveness of the approach is analyzed using the flood disaster in the Ahr Valley as an example. In addition, an economic evaluation of the measures is carried out using a cost-benefit analysis. The analysis suggests that resilience and sustainability, when integrated methodically, can be treated as complementary rather than competing objectives in the context of future-proof grid development."

The main characteristics of the new inverter are the absence of an output filter, ZCS (Zero Current Switching) and ZVS (Zero Voltage Switching) non-dissipative switching, high electrical efficiency, and the ability to provide sinusoidal voltage with low total harmonic distortion to both linear and non-linear loads over a wide frequency range. The topology consists of four semiconductor switches, with non-dissipative commutations operate during part of the operating periods. ZCS occurs in the switches S2 and S3 connected to the output capacitor, while ZVS occurs in the switches S1 and S4 connected to the DC sources. During the positive half-cycle of the generated sinusoid, switches S3 and S4 operate in soft commutation. During the negative half-cycle generation, switches S1 and S2 assume this function, operating in non-dissipative mode. This new single-phase sinusoidal inverter has been patented in Brazil and the United States. Theoretical analysis, simulations, practical results and efficiency are presented in the face of frequency variation and load variation in the fixed frequency of 60 Hz."

It is applied to maximize desirable resultsproduct yield, purity, or efficiency-together with the minimization of undesirable factors such as energy use, waste generation, and operating expenses. This is accomplished by utilization of statistical design of experiments (DOE) and highlevel computational algorithms to enable engineers to probe into the intricate interactions between process variables with the lowest possible number of experimental tests. Finally, this strategy is critical because it turns experimentation from an ad hoc process into a discipline-based, data-intensive science and allows the construction of safer, more cost-effective, and environmentally benign chemical processes in research and industrial environments.

    "abstract": "In high-precision manufacturing domains such as military equipment and aerospace, assembly accuracy of complex products fundamentally determines their core performance and operational reliability. Traditional assembly error modeling approaches encounter significant limitations when characterizing the nonlinear behaviors of ‘geometry-mechanics’ coupling, particularly in addressing contact deformation and dynamic coupling effects. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative Jacobian-Torsor embedded neural network approach. The proposed method incorporates the Jacobian-Torsor theory by imposing physical constraints within the neural network architecture, enabling precise modeling of nonlinear mechanisms through a joint optimization framework that combines the ‘Jacobian-Torsor loss function' with network prediction errors. The approach leverages the multi-layer nonlinear mapping capabilities of neural networks to capture implicit correlations while employing kinematic constraints from Jacobian-Torsor theory to regularize network training, thereby significantly enhancing small-sample generalization and physical interpretability. Experimental validation on a dual-axis turntable demonstrates substantial improvements, with prediction errors reduced by 46.51%, 37.44%, and 50.86% in the x, y, and z directions respectively, compared to conventional networks without Jacobian embedding. This cross-domain fusion framework, integrating physical mechanism constraints and datadriven fitting, establishes a novel pathway for addressing the nonlinear transfer challenges in high-precision assembly applications."

    "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy leads to vision loss and people suffering with this blindness worldwide. By identifying diabetic retinopathy early, the risk of blindness due to diabetics can be decreased. Ophthalmologists have long depended on the laborious, manual method of diabetic retinopathy screening, which is time consuming and tends to inaccurate results. Computerized diagnosis method is found as diagnostic tools for confirming the opinions of ophthalmologists, has taken less time with chances of giving accurate result. In this research, we have collected diabetic retinopathy dataset from Kaggle database and experimented NASNet deep learning model on DR dataset to classify diabetic retinopathy in contrast to non-diabetic retinopathy. We have found the performance of NASNet as 99% accuracy. Again, ResNet-50, MobileNet, AlexNet and DenseNet models are trained on the same dataset and comparatively found that NASNet has given better performance. However, more experiments are needed to find a suitable model for prediction of diabetic retinopathy."

    "abstract": "Realistic avatar motion in VR environments is crucial for user immersion, emphasizing the need for techniques that transform basic movements into professional-level articulation. We propose a lightweight framework (I-MOR) that employs quaternion-based representations to bridge user input and high-quality motion generation efficiently. Rather than relying on templates or data-driven models, I-MOR captures instantaneous angular changes from expressive gestures and maps them to frame-wise transformations. SpongeBob Shuffle dance recordings are analyzed to extract quantitative velocity, acceleration, and directional profiles as physical benchmarks. During authoring, user input is continuously compared to these benchmarks, enabling intuitive modulation of rhythm, sharpness, and range without altering core structure. Experiments show that users can synthesize professional-quality motion timing and articulation through simple gestures, advancing low-barrier control, grounded motion generation, and intention-aware authoring in VR."

Using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and random forest classification, the approach efficiently predicts key tiger habitats while ensuring scalability and computational efficiency. A two-phased ensemble approach, involving ten independent model runs with balanced presence and pseudo-absence data, demonstrated high predictive performance (AUC-ROC: 0.8969 ± 0.0695; PR-AUC: 0.8509 ± 0.0506). Key predictors—elevation, slope, distance to water bodies and human settlements, and seasonal precipitation—were consistently identified as ecologically meaningful variables. The model generated continuous and binary habitat suitability maps that accurately delineated critical tiger habitats in the Sundarbans, Central India, and the Western Ghats. The ensemble approach ensured spatial and statistical robustness, confirming the effectiveness of cloud-integrated machine learning for large-scale ecological modeling. This methodology offers valuable insights for tiger conservation planning and can be adapted for habitat assessment of other threatened species."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the performance of a ninephase induction motor under overload conditions, comparing two configurations: operation with four poles and nominal airgap flux, and operation with twelve poles and variable airgap flux. The pole count is modified electronically using Pole Phase Modulation (PPM), while flux variation is achieved by adjusting the voltage-to-frequency ratio. Although increasing the number of poles enhances torque production, it also reduces the machine's magnetizing inductance, leading to elevated stator currents and reduced power factor. This work explores how controlled flux reduction can mitigate these effects, enabling significant torque gains with lower overload currents and extended thermal operating limits. The study evaluates key performance metrics, such as torque, current demand, power factor, copper losses, and converter stress, in both scenarios. Additionally, it includes an analysis of the implications for converter sizing in overload operation. The findings offer insights into the trade-offs and practical advantages of pole-changing multiphase machines in applications requiring high transient torque, such as heavy electric vehicles, cranes, and industrial machinery."

In particular, systems that analyze user posture and deliver real-time feedback are rapidly advancing in weight training. However, most existing systems rely on single-frame analysis or simple visual comparison, limiting their ability to capture continuous movements and user-specific characteristics.We propose a novel system that utilizes real-time 3D pose estimation algorithm in combination with a custom-developed joint angle-based imbalance detection algorithm to automatically identify postural asymmetries occurring during weight training and provide feedback based on a Large Language Model (LLM). Detected postural imbalances are visualized in real time as overlays on the video, and all related data are chronologically recorded. The accumulated data are then processed through the GPT-4o to generate comprehensive text-based reports from functional-anatomical and biomechanical perspectives. These reports include potential risk factors, root cause analysis, and corrective strategies such as stretching and accessory exercises. Users can subsequently engage in interactive, dialogue-based feedback sessions with our system to gain deeper insights."

    "abstract": "High-capacity (above 100 Ah) lithium-ion battery (LIB) cells are the core building units of grid-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS). For optimal thermal performance and lifespan, the temperature of hundreds of LIB cells in BESS must be maintained within a relatively narrow range ($25-40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$) while preserving spatial uniformity within and across the cells. BESS exhibit hierarchical thermal transport across multiple length scales spanning up to six orders of magnitude. This work proposes a cost-effective hierarchical methodology for modeling thermal transport across sub-cell, cell, module, and rack domains. This methodology leverages high-fidelity finite elements simulations to hierarchically characterize relevant BESS domains through effective thermophysical properties and heat generation rates obtained from a representative number of sub-domains, without explicitly modeling all individual components within each BESS domain. The practical application of this methodology is illustrated through a case study of a $220-\\mathrm{kWh}$ BESS serving as an energy buffer for an electric vehicle fast charging station. This study quantifies how changes at the smallest levels in the hierarchy, such as electrode thickness at the sub-cell level, impact the system-level thermal performance and reliability."

Facility layout optimization plays a crucial role in saving material handling cost and emission. Conventional approaches are very inefficient in compromising among several competing objectives. This paper suggests that Green Manufacturing processes can be optimized by the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique for minimum Total Material Handling Cost (TMHC) and emission. Experiments were performed on a typical computing platform with Python and a high number of iterations, and the findings indicated that the PSO model greatly outmatched Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (ASSO). The PSO obtained the minimum emission of 177.8 and best TMHC of 2,141,814 at the 30th iteration. Comparative analysis confirmed the effectiveness of PSO in terms of comparative environmental and economic benefits. The presented concept can be applied to the sustainable and cost-effective production at the large scale. The results show the potential uses of PSO as an efficient solution to improve sustainability in manufacturing."

    "abstract": "As the era of big data and AI arrives, the amount and size of data that needs to be processed continue to increase, and the performance of data centers is improving day by day to meet this demand. However, since it requires too much energy to cool the heat generated by the performance improvement of the data center with a conventional air cooling method, research is actively underway to switch to immersion cooling. Among the essential components of a data center is a solid-state drive (SSD), which has a relatively low heat generation per device, but since dozens of devices are installed per rack, the total heat generation cannot be ignored. Therefore, it is important to accurately predict the thermal characteristics of SSDs when operating in an immersion cooling environment, and based on this, optimizing the design of the immersion cooling environment can satisfy the operating temperature of the SSD while lowering the power usage efficiency (PUE) of the data center. In this study, we established a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation to predict the temperature characteristics of data center SSDs when applied to a single-phase immersion cooling (SPIC) environment, and verified the accuracy of the prediction model by constructing an experimental setup and verifying the temperature during operation. The CFD simulation was performed using FloTHERM, and based on the SSD model that shows an error level of less than $10 \\%$ in the previously established air cooling environment, the fluid condition was changed to Shell S5X, a hydrocarbon-based fluid, to establish a simulation model for a SPIC condition. Next, a SPIC tank capable of mounting a 1U rack server was built for the experiment, and the temperature of major components inside the SSD was measured under various coolant flow rate conditions by installing a SAMSUNG enterprise-class SSD. Through the experiment results, it was confirmed that there was an error of up to $15 \\%$ in the simulation results, which was expected to occur due to inaccurate measurement of the flow rate passing through the SSD. Finally, based on the simulation and experimental results, we predicted the thermal designed power (TDP) that could be operated without thermal throttling when the SAMSUNG enterprise-class SSD operates in a SPIC condition, and it was expected that up to 80W could be used when operating the fluid at $35^{\\prime} \\mathrm{C}$, confirming that the next-generation 70W or higher form factor can be sufficiently cooled by the appropriate control of coolant condition."

However, the use of speed sensors increases the overall system cost and undermines the inherent simplicity and robustness of induction motors, particularly in harsh environments. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a sensorless speed estimation method based on the Model Reference Adaptive System (MRAS) framework. The proposed approach constructs a speed estimation scheme by leveraging both the voltage and current models of rotor flux linkage, and derives an adaptive law grounded in Popov's hyperstability theory. A simulation model is implemented in MATLAB/Simulink to validate the strategy. The results show that the proposed method achieves accurate and stable rotor speed estimation under varying load and speed conditions, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for practical sensorless vector control of induction motors."

It has the characteristics of complex power grid structure, various meter types, diverse collection and communication methods, which bring great challenges to the scheduling of collection tasks. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a virtual station collection task scheduling method combining whale optimization algorithm and deep reinforcement learning. The deep Q network is optimized by whale optimization algorithm, and the virtual station environment model is constructed. The current connection number, signal strength, task priority, importance and urgency of the collection task are integrated to construct a state space, which provides information support for the decision-making of the agent. In the agent, ε-greedy strategy is used to select actions to realize intelligent task scheduling. Through simulation experiments, the task completion rate of the proposed method is 95.02%, and the average task completion time is 2413.36ms.

Within the Erasmus+ Knowledge Alliance \"Projects for the Digital Transformation (ProDiT)\" the characteristics of DTP and the respective processes, methods and tools have been investigated, new methods have been developed and evaluated. Furthermore, guidelines, teaching and training materials were developed, and case studies were compiled. This contribution provides an overview of the results and illustrates the findings by giving examples based on the case of a Smart City project which conducts the digital transformation in cities, covering a broad range of relevant aspects."

Subsequently, based on AprilTag-derived pose information, combined with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and altimeter data, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm is employed for high-precision fused state estimation of the UAV, converting visual coordinates into precise displacement control commands in the geodetic coordinate system. The algorithm was systematically validated on the Microsoft AirSim simulation platform. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the precision and robustness of UAV landing, with an average landing error maintained within the centimeter-level range. This verifies the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed algorithm in complex environments, offering a reliable technical pathway for future autonomous precise UAV landing."

There are a number of obstacles that need to be overcome before electric vehicles can be widely adopted. These include higher initial costs, longer charging times, shorter driving ranges caused by restricted battery capacity, and the added expense of increasing battery capacity to alleviate range anxiety. Market penetration is slowed down by these problems. A data-driven solution was created utilising powerful machine learning techniques to address these limitations and improve Electric Vehicles Charging Management. Prior to feature selection using SPCA, the dataset was subjected to preparation procedures like data cleaning and numerical feature normalisation. The training model used real-world charging data from Temixco and is a two-layer CNN-LSTM. By surpassing previous models, the suggested model achieved an outstanding accuracy rate of 98.56 % when tested on two popular benchmarks. These findings demonstrate the promise of the CNN-LSTM architecture for improved management of electric vehicle charging. Scalable electric vehicle integration is supported by this model, which optimizes charging procedures, allowing for smarter and more sustainable energy management and assisting in the overcoming of important adoption hurdles."

To address these issues, this letter proposes a lightweight mamba-based hybrid network, namely LMHMamba, whose core is an innovative lightweight multi-feature hybrid mamba (LMHM) module. This module combines the advantage of StarNet in implicitly generating high-dimensional nonlinear features, introduces a lightweight state space module to enhance spatial feature learning capabilities, and then uses local and global attention modules to emphasize local and global features. This enables effective multi-dimensional feature fusion while maintaining low parameter. We validate the performance of LMHMamba model on three remote sensing scene classification datasets and compare it with mainstream lightweight models and the latest methods. Experimental results show that LMHMamba achieves advanced levels in both classification accuracy and computational efficiency, significantly outperforming existing lightweight models, providing an efficient solution for edge deployment.

    "abstract": "Federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm through centralized model aggregation. However, standard federated learning relies on a centralized server, making it vulnerable to server failures. While existing solutions utilize blockchain technology to implement Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL), the statistical heterogeneity of data distributions among clients severely degrades the performance of DFL. Driven by this issue, this paper proposes a decentralized federated prototype learning framework, named DFPL, which significantly improves the performance of DFL under heterogeneous data distributions. Specifically, DFPL introduces prototype learning into DFL to mitigate the impact of statistical heterogeneity and reduces the amount of parameters exchanged between clients. Additionally, blockchain is embedded into our framework, enabling the training and mining processes to be executed locally on each client. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze the convergence of DFPL by modeling the required computational resources during both training and mining. The experiment results highlight the superiority of DFPL in both model performance and communication efficiency across four benchmark datasets with heterogeneous data distributions."

    "abstract": "This paper considers mmWave networks with full-frequency reuse, where each base station (BS) employs a hybrid beamforming (HBF) architecture. We propose a beam scheduling scheme that guarantees users’ target rates, using the smallest possible number of slots at each BS in each transmission block. We avoid intra-BS interference by enforcing constraints that ensure users in adjacent spatial areas are not scheduled simultaneously. We formulate the beam scheduling task as a stochastic mixed-integer nonconvex time allocation problem, allocating time to user-BS links, and provide a novel iterative algorithm that solves the problem. In each iteration there are three stages. Stage one optimizes the time-fraction allocation for user-BS links given an estimate of user rates in each transmission block. Stage two allocates these time-fractions to beams at each BS using a sand-filling policy. Stage three schedules the beams, and updates the estimate of user rates in each block. We apply the scheduler to a HBF transmitter with a zero-forcing (ZF) digital component, and compare its performance to a pure analog beamformer. Numerical results reveal that our proposed scheduling scheme significantly outperforms baseline schemes, and that intra-BS interference is so effectively avoided that the digital ZF is not needed in the HBF."

    "abstract": "Large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) connections in dynamic low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks face significant challenges in uplink resource scheduling. This paper proposes a framework for optimizing spectral efficiency. The framework satisfies heterogeneous quality of service (QoS) requirements and dynamic buffer constraints under time-varying IoT traffic bursts. It integrates three critical aspects. First, it considers the spatial geometric relationship between satellites and ground user equipment (UE), which determines the connection duration. Second, it achieves service-specific QoS priorities through an adaptive weighting mechanism. Third, it addresses time-varying traffic patterns. Under time-varying resource constraints, the high-dimensional scheduling optimization problem is modeled as a multi-dimensional multi-choice knapsack problem (MMKP). A satellite selection scheme is proposed to efficiently solve the MMKP with mixed constraints. This scheme simplifies the three-dimensional knapsack problem (KP) into a two-dimensional one by taking connection duration into account. This reduction explicitly accounts for the space and time limitations of satellite-ground links. It also integrates service-specific priorities. Meanwhile, the scheme enables each satellite to handle its own computations and resource allocation independently. A binary split dynamic programming (BSDP) algorithm is developed to solve the two-dimensional KP. To compare performance, two large-scale integer optimization methods—the Lagrangian Relaxation Algorithm (LRA) and Branch and Bound (B&B)—were used to solve the KP. The results were compared with a perception-based greedy resource block (RB) allocation for the original resource allocation problem. Extensive simulations based on Starlink demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. When serving over 4000 UEs, the MMKP solution achieves a 46% gain in QoS compared to the greedy benchmark. It also achieves a 60.7% throughput gain. Additionally, BSDP performs almost as well as B&B. BSDP has approximately two orders of magnitude lower computational cost than LRA."

The pressure-gradient receiving model of pairs of symmetrically distributed MEMS sensors in acoustic field is analyzed, guiding the structure design of the tri-axial acoustic differential pressure vector hydrophone. Calibrations in a standing wave tube are conducted. The effectively operating working frequency band for the presented vector hydrophone is within 20–2000 Hz. The acoustic sensitivities of the hydrophone for the three axes are −182.1 dB@ 1000Hz, -182.5 dB@ 1000 Hz and -182.8 dB @1000 Hz (0 dB = 1 V/μPa), respectively, with a maximum error of less than ±1 dB. Moreover, apparent “eight-shape” directivities for the three axes coupled with the concave point depths of 43.2 dB, 42.1 dB and 39.3 dB, and the asymmetries of 1.8 dB, 2 dB and 1.9 dB are demonstrated.

    "abstract": "With the advance of emerging digital twin (DT) technology, the combination of DT with edge intelligence brings great potential for high-fidelity, delay-sensitive inference services at the network edge. Due to the training data drift over time, the accuracy of an inference model degrades dramatically. To maintain and/or enhance its accuracy, the service model requires to be continuously retrained using newly generated update data. However, model retraining and inference services compete with each other for the limited computing resource in a mobile edge computing network (MEC), which may decrease user satisfaction with services due to unbearable service delays caused by insufficient resource supplies. Therefore, to ensure high fidelity of service models by choosing models for retraining while maximizing user satisfaction, it becomes a great challenge to allocate the limited computing resource in an MEC to both model retraining and inference services. In this paper, we investigate fidelity-aware, delay-sensitive services in a DT-assisted MEC network over a given time horizon. We study a novel user satisfaction maximization problem with the aim to maximize the long-term user satisfaction on services. We first formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) solution to its offline version. We then devise an online algorithm for the problem with a bounded expected cumulative regret, by leveraging an efficient prediction mechanism and a multi-armed bandit (MAB) based resource allocation strategy. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm via simulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is promising, outperforming the comparison benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Extreme weather events increasingly disrupt agricultural supply chains (ASCs). Insurance serves as a vital financial buffer, compensating smallholder farmers' input costs while also enhancing their ability to repay loans. Traditional insurance, due to lengthy verification and delayed payouts, limits the farmers' quick response to extreme weather. Recently, smart insurance has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging index-based verification and automated payouts to facilitate timely farmer recovery. This study explores the operation of an e-commerce-based ASC under extreme weather, considering dual protection of crop insurance (traditional or smart) and government subsidies (premium or input). We examine the insurer's decision to adopt smart insurance and its alignment with the socially optimal outcome. Our results show that when farmer recovery efficiency is low, smart insurance is preferred only if traditional verification incurs high costs. Conversely, with efficient farmer recovery, the insurer always adopts smart insurance, which empowers the ASC to sustain under severe weather conditions but may lead to a decline in social welfare due to the associated subsidy expenditure. Furthermore, we analyze the implications of insurance innovation for government subsidy policies. We find that smart insurance can resolve the policy dilemma faced by traditional insurance, where no policy can outperform the other in both farmer well-being and social welfare under severe weather conditions. In contrast, smart insurance enables the input subsidy to achieve a dual-benefit outcome. This finding highlights the potential of insurance innovation in improving government policy effectiveness."

    "abstract": "In the ride-hailing market, platforms such as Didi Chuxing are increasingly collaborating with taxi services through the integrated channel, like Simultaneous Ride-Hailing Request (SR). SR allows riders to submit a single request that includes both platform-based and taxi services, with the platform allocating each request to one of the two services and charging the corresponding price. To investigate the implications of SR, we develop an analytical model of a ride-hailing platform that integrates a platform-based service with self-scheduling drivers and a taxi service with fixed supply. Riders differ in their service preferences and sensitivity to driver availability. We find that although integrating the taxi service into the platform intensifies competition for riders between the two services, SR can yield a win-win outcome by improving both platform profitability and taxi utilization. In particular, SR enables the platform to serve additional riders without lowering the price and helps the taxi service alleviate demand loss caused by offline search frictions, thereby mitigating price competition across services. Moreover, we identify the sensitivity of self-scheduling drivers to rider availability as a key performance determinant driving these results. When self-scheduling drivers are sufficiently sensitive, SR adoption is profitable by enhancing supply–demand coordination. Finally, we confirm the robustness of our results by relaxing two key assumptions: allowing the platform to charge the commission fee on the taxi service and permitting platform-based riders to also use SR. Overall, this study provides new insights into platform–taxi cooperation and contributes to the broader understanding of sustainable ride-hailing markets."

We propose Classification Based on MissForest Imputation (CBMI), a classification strategy that initializes the predicted test label with missing values and stacks the label with the input for imputation, allowing the label and the input to be imputed simultaneously. In addition, we propose the Imputation Using Labels (IUL) algorithm, an imputation strategy that stacks the label into the input and illustrates how it can significantly improve the imputation quality. Experiments show that CBMI has competitive classification accuracy when the test set contains missing data, especially for imbalanced data and categorical data. Moreover, for both the regression and classification, IUL consistently shows significantly better results than imputation based on only the input data."

In contrast to existing tracking control strategies, this paper considers the realistic scenario where the reference signal to be tracked is inexactly known. This condition renders the tracking error unobtainable with precision, which consequently poses significant challenges to the tracking control problem. To overcome this challenge, a special finite-time performance function (FTPF) is first proposed. Subsequently, based on the FTPF and the fault-tolerant control (FTC), an RPPFTT controller is developed, ensuring that all states of the closed-loop system remain globally bounded. Furthermore, the tracking error satisfies the prescribed performance bounds and converges to a predefined neighborhood of the equilibrium within any given time, even under the dual challenges of an inexactly known reference signal and actuator faults. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed method."

It employs multi-graph isolation to preserve domain-specific semantics and leverages a distributed agent architecture coordinated through Data Distribution Service (DDS) for scalable and fault-tolerant operations. Each agent specializes in tasks such as retrieval, generation, or evaluation, forming a modular and traceable pipeline. Distinctively, the framework encodes semantic hierarchies, PageRank-based concept weighting, and assessment-theory parameters directly into the generation process, ensuring that questions are both contextually grounded and cognitively calibrated. Deployed at Taiwan’s National Institute of Environmental Research, the system has demonstrated practical value by reducing manual workload, improving reliability and validity, and supporting both adaptive and standardized assessments.

    "abstract": "Traditional refrigerants used in vapor compression cooling are excellent heat transfer fluids because they change phase at relatively convenient temperatures and pressures. The latent energy associated with this phase change allows for large amounts of heat transfer. Shape memory alloy (SMA) thermocaloric heat pumps are a potential alternative to refrigerant based vapor compression cooling. These heat pumps take advantage of the unique feature of solid SMA materials. When compressed, these materials undergo a solid-to-solid phase change that releases heat. When the compression is released, the phase change is reversed, and the material absorbs heat. The latent heat associated with the phase change, which occurs at room temperature, can be used to provide heating or cooling. By cycling two or more solid heat pump cores, continuous cooling can be provided by an SMA heat pump. Heat pump systems using shape memory alloys like nitinol, can be used to provide cooling. This study examines two potential thermocaloric systems that could be used for data center cooling and compares their performance against a traditional aircooled water chiller. The first thermocaloric system uses a solid block of material with interior channels for cooling water flow. The second system design uses wires instead of a solid block, with cooling water flowing between the wires. A high-level cost comparison was performed to compare the annual energy cost and the purchase cost for each system. The block-based cooler had much higher purchase and energy costs than the alternatives. The wire-based cooler had high purchase costs, but energy costs that were lower than the other two systems. The traditional chiller had the lowest purchase cost, but higher energy use than the wire cooler system. The low energy use estimated for the wire cooler system indicates that there is potential benefit for continued study of this cooling technology, particularly if material costs could be reduced."

Firstly, combined with the early warning mission requirement framework, the analytical expressions of the networked radar joint interception probability, multi-task echo signal-to-noise ratio, and global task allocation utility function with radar-task node scheduling parameters as variables are derived respectively, which are used as indicators to measure the survival capability of one's own battlefield, target detection performance, and multi-task collaborative execution efficiency. On this basis, with the goal of maximizing the global collaborative scheduling utility function of networked radars, and subject to constraints such as meeting the given maximum allocable time resources of radars, echo signal-to-noise ratio, system detection performance, and minimum interception probability of networked radars, an airborne radar resource scheduling model based on multi-task collaborative planning is established. Finally, a discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm improved based on compression factors is proposed to solve the above nonlinear discrete optimization problem, adaptively generate the global task allocation matrix of radars, and optimize the allocation results of radar-task node scheduling parameters. Simulation results show that compared with other algorithms, the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the efficiency of multi-task collaborative execution and realize efficient resource scheduling of airborne radars."

    "abstract": "Polyp segmentation is a critical step in colorectal cancer detection, but it remains challenging due to the varied shapes, sizes, and low-contrast boundaries of polyps in medical imaging. In this work, we introduce a novel framework designed to improve segmentation accuracy and efficiency by incorporating a Dynamic Kernel (DK) mechanism and a global Encoder Attention (EA) module. The DK mechanism, initialized by a global context vector from the EA module, iteratively refines segmentation predictions across decoding stages, allowing the model to focus on and accurately delineate complex polyp boundaries. The EA module enhances the network's ability to capture critical lesion features by aggregating multi-scale features from all encoder layers. Additionally, we implement Unified Channel Adaptation (UCA) in the decoder, which standardizes feature dimensions across stages, ensuring consistent and computationally efficient information fusion. We clarify that our approach builds upon the lesion-aware kernel framework [1] by introducing a more flexible, attention-driven kernel initialization and a unified decoder design. Extensive experiments on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art segmentation models, achieving superior Dice and Intersection over Union (IoU) scores. The UCA simplifies the decoder architecture, resulting in reduced computational cost without compromising accuracy. Our proposed method thus provides a robust, adaptable solution for polyp segmentation, with potential applications in clinical and automated diagnostic systems."

It is a gravityassisted device (evaporator below condenser), as gravity helps liquid return from the condenser to the evaporator. For modeling of a loop thermosyphon, the general assumptions used are (a) two-phase flow exists in the riser and (b) the downcomer is partially or completely filled. However, it is not well understood in which conditions these assumptions are valid, as they depend on the filling ratio, working fluid, and operating heat loads. The present study experimentally explores flow patterns in the riser and downcomer to verify these assumptions. A stainless-steel loop thermosyphon with horizontal evaporator and condenser is utilized. A portion of the riser and downcomer are made of glass tubes to enable visualization of the flow pattern. The effect of working fluid (methanol and isobutane), filling ratio ($20 \\%-50 \\%$), and heat load ($100 \\mathrm{~W}-500 \\mathrm{~W}$) on the flow pattern is investigated. It is found that the flow pattern in the riser is generally two-phase (plug/churn to churn flow) and can be single-phase under certain conditions. In the downcomer, the liquid level is observed to be fluctuating."

    "abstract": "Steel is a widely used industrial material in the construction, home appliance and automotive industries. Defects generated during production can pose safety hazards, so identifying surface defects is critical. In response to the challenges of high computational resource consumption and low detection accuracy in existing models for industrial quality inspection tasks, this paper presents a lightweight object detection model called YOLO-DW, which is based on the YOLOv11 algorithm framework. Firstly, the DSCB module was designed to reduce model parameters significantly while enhancing the extraction of features for subtle surface defects in steel. Secondly, the Wise-IoU loss function was introduced, leveraging its dynamic, non-monotonic focusing mechanism to quantify positional offsets and scale differences between predicted and actual defect bounding boxes, thereby improving regression accuracy. Finally, comparative and ablation experiments on the public NEU-DET dataset validated the effectiveness of the algorithm. The results show that YOLO-DW achieves an mAP of 79.4% at 50% and an mAP of 49.8% at 95%, with a computational complexity of just 5.9 GFLOPs. YOLO-DW strikes an efficient balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency, meeting the demands of real-time, on-site detection in the steel industry and providing a highly effective technical solution for steel surface defect detection."

Generally, the traditional query optimizers are not considering the varying pricing models and resource characteristics like I/O, CPU, and network egress costs offered by different cloud providers like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. To address this gap, we propose a Dynamic CostAware SQL Rewriting Algorithm (DCAS) that adaptively rewrites SQL queries to minimize both query cost and execution latency in multi-cloud environments. The algorithm employs a cost model that estimates the monetary expense of a query by analyzing its resource consumption across different clouds. It applies to a combination of fixed and selective rewriting strategies, guided by historical performance data and current cloud pricing, to generate semantically cost-efficient query formulations. The system architecture enables seamless integration with existing query engines and supports asynchronous cost synthesis through region-specific repositories and runtime feedback loops."

    "abstract": "Polymer-based thermal interface materials (TIMs) are polymeric matrix materials with heat-conducting fillers used to lower the operating temperatures of microelectronics by reducing the thermal resistance between contact surfaces. These thermal interface materials have experienced accelerated growth in recent years driven by the ever-increasing performance and functions of electronic systems pushing the thermal management requirements of devices at an unprecedented pace aligned with several megatrends such as the rapid global adoption of electric vehicles, autonomous driving, 5G, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI). A proper selection of thermally conductive composites is critical to the thermal management performance, reliability, and safety of the devices in targeted applications. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid modeling approach that combines thermal finite element analysis (FEA) with statistical modeling. This approach was used to study and identify the critical factors impacting microelectronic device temperature and to guide the selection of TIMs for different applications. A 2D steady state heat transfer FEA model was first developed and validated using experimental data obtained from an in-house thermal test vehicle (TTV). A second FEA model was developed based on a land grid array (LGA) package design from literature. Parametric studies and numerical design of experiments (DOEs) were conducted using the second FEA model to build statistical models for analyzing the factors affecting device thermal management and TIM selection for different applications. An inverse model was developed from the statistical model using statistical software JMP to gain insights into TIM development and selection based on targeted applications. The insights gained from this work are valuable for engineers and researchers working in the field of thermally conductive composites and microelectronic device development and application."

    "abstract": "Immersion cooling designs, wherein the battery cells and bussing are directly submerged in a circulated dielectric coolant, are a promising battery thermal management solution, especially for high performance vehicles due to its cooling potential. A topology optimization procedure has been developed to analytically design an immersion cooling passage for a prismatic battery cell module. The procedure utilizes a combined 2D-3D CFD approach. Starting from an empty cavity of a single cell, an optimizer first morphs a new cooling passage in 2D by solving a porosity transport equation based on a linear weighted merit function of cell temperature and flow pressure drop. Next, the 2D flow passage is converted into a 3D model and replicated over the entire prismatic cell module. The resulting thermal simulation is validated using rigorous flow and heat dissipation boundary conditions. Initial results show the optimized design has a 5 degC reduction in maximum temperature consistently over a range of coolant flow rates. However, it is found that the 2D topology solution can have regions of small, non-zero permeability interpreted as coolant seepage through walls. As a result, imposing small flow-through channels in the 3D model lowers maximum cell temperature and flow pressure drop at high flow rates when compared to a baseline design."

Thermal performance, switching frequency range, magnetic component volume, and copper utilization are important parameters examined. A 3kW prototype was tested with fixed input and output voltages of 250V and 350V, respectively. The results indicate that increasing <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$k$</tex> improves efficiency at lighter loads but expands the switching frequency range. The dual transformer configuration setup promotes better thermal distribution and reduces peak temperatures by splitting the magnetic flux and current among the windings. However, this configuration increases the overall volume, weight, and component size. The results reinforce the balance that can be achieved between thermal performance, resonant efficiency, and size in resonant converters."

In a controlled virtual reality study simulating urban wayfinding, we also manipulate the presence of tall, visually distinctive buildings to examine the role of landmarks in spatial orientation and memory.Results show that SkyMap supports comparable performance to conventional maps across all measures, including spatial recall, challenging previous assumptions that HUD hinder spatial knowledge acquisition. Landmark presence, however, had no significant effect on wayfinding or memory. These findings highlight the potential of HUD-based survey maps for immersive navigation tasks and provide design recommendations for enhancing spatial awareness in AR interfaces."

We initially demonstrated a limit of detection (LOD) of 43.3 ng/mL for C-reactive protein (CRP). In two more recent studies, the sensitivity was improved using two different methods. The first was enhancing the Q factor of the resonance cavity by increasing the thickness of the reflective layers used to fabricate the device. The second was investigating different APTES silanization processes which led us to select a methanol-based process that yielded more sensitive results due to the monolayer-like characteristics it produced. In this work, these two improvements are used together to improve the CRP LOD to 46.3 pg/mL, a nearly 1000 times improvement over our first findings. Having demonstrated such high sensitivity while using low-cost optical components, we believe our OCB shows great promise for use as a point-of-care biosensor."

This paper introduces the Current Virtual Oscillator Control (cVOC), a novel current-mode control technique inspired by the Virtual Oscillator Control (VOC) method originally developed for voltage-controlled inverters. The proposed cVOC strategy synthesizes the reference current directly from the measured grid voltage waveform, enabling independent control of apparent power magnitude and power factor angle without requiring filtered calculations of active/reactive power or RMS quantities. This leads to faster dynamic response and inherent harmonic attenuation. Simulation results demonstrated that the cVOC accurately tracked power references and maintained stability despite voltage disturbances."

This paper focuses on the experimental investigation of oil-jet cooling applied to a segment of winding representing the end-windings of a high-power electric machine’s stator. The coils subjected to the oil jet are meticulously instrumented, enabling comprehe nsive monitoring of temperature distribution across the entire coil surface. Our study showcases the effective ness of this cooling technique, revealing a maximum temperature of $84^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ on the end-windings under oil jet. Additionally, we conduct evaluations using various oils characterized by different viscosity ranges and thermal conductivities. Our findings culminate in a comparative analys is of oil-jet cooling against alte rnative methods, including air jet cooling and parallel air flow."

The integration of these devices not only enhances system reliability but also effectively mitigates large frequency oscillations in the transmission lines. A Modified Fractional Order Tilt Integral Derivative (MFOTID) controller with a filtering mechanism is employed to ensure precise and stable frequency regulation.

    "abstract": "With the heterogenous integration roadmaps claiming the decline of Moore’s Law is inevitable, industries are looking at alternatives to pack more functionalities into the electronic packages. As they head towards 3D integration, interposers play a pivotal role in enabling the connections between different chips. Over the last two decades organic and silicon interposers have gained wide popularity and applications, but they are not devoid of limitations. The high cost of silicon interposer and relatively low interconnect density in organic interposer have propelled researchers to look at glass as interposer material. Glass interposers have high electrical resistivity, low cost and low insertion losses. Among a wide variety of glass interposers available, Borosilicate glass interposer with high thermal resistance, optical transmission and high chemical durability, is widely used in the electronic industry, especially in LCD panels owing to its CTE match with silicon and ease of panel-based processing. Copper filled Through Package Vias (TPVs) in glass interposers enable the communication between vertically stacked chips when the lateral communication is taken care of by redistribution layers. But the Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) mismatch between copper (~ 17.3 ppm/°C) and glass (~ 3.3 ppm/°C) contribute to non-uniform expansion at the interface of TPV and contribute to stresses during thermal cycling. The present study aims at using finite-element method to optimize the copper filled Through Package Via geometry by investigating radial stress and axial strain at critical corners of the interface for different height to diameter ratios of TPV under thermal cycling."

At the same time, in order to solve the problem of slow response of proportional integral (PI) control by the speed outer ring, the self-interference immunity control (ADRC) and sliding mode control (SMC) technology are integrated in the outer ring design, and the sliding mode self-interference immunity (SM-ADRC) outer ring control method is proposed. The simulation results show that it can effectively shorten the response time, improve the anti-interference ability of the system and inhibit the SRM torque pulsation."

In order to classify breast cancer using medical imaging data, this study compares machine learning (ML) with deep learning (DL) approaches. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms were used to classify the features that were retrieved using the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) in the machine learning technique. Among these techniques, the best accuracy attained was 85.17%. Using pre-trained architectures like VGG16 and ResNet16, convolutional layers were used in the DL technique to automatically extract features. These models performed quite well, with a maximum accuracy of 96.55%. The findings unequivocally show that deep learning models perform better than conventional machine learning methods that depend on manually created features since they can instantly learn intricate patterns from photos. This study supports the incorporation of DL into computer-aided diagnostic systems for clinical usage and emphasizes its potential to improve breast cancer diagnosis."

To address this, this paper proposes a load characteristic-oriented transmission and distribution pricing mechanism, which integrates flexible load scheduling to establish a day-ahead optimal scheduling model for IES.In the pricing mechanism design, a BARY curve-based capacity cost allocation method is adopted under user load factor considerations, enabling the formulation of a scientifically rational two-part tariff scheme. By incorporating a flexible load model, the proposed framework optimizes both the economic performance andflexibility of load management. The IES optimization model minimizes operational costs as its objective function, solved using the Gurobi solver within a Python-based simulation platform. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively improves the load factor of IES, optimizes the load profile, and enhances the allocation of energy resources. Economic analysis further verifies that the method achieves significant improvements in system profitability by reducing redundant capacity investments and operational losses."

However, existing Level-of-Detail (LOD) with Occlusion Culling Virtual Reality (OC-VR) display systems often straggles with semantic information loss, abrupt visual transitions and reduced user immersion under bandwidth constraints. To overcome these limitations, this research proposes the Perceptual-Semantic Adaptive Rendering (PSAR) method to design the application of a digital display system for excellent traditional Chinese culture. Initially, the system architecture incorporates Data Capture and Asset Packaging (DCAP) for high-fidelity models and annotations. Then, system integrates Semantic Importance Graph (SIG) to protect culturally significant motifs, and a Perceptual Importance Estimator (PIE) to model user gaze and task focus. These are combined by a Gaze- and Task-driven LOD Selector (GT-LS) to balance perceptual attention with semantic value to guide rendering. A Hybrid Rendering Manager (HRM) and Neural-Enhanced Reconstruction (NER) ensure efficient, high-quality visualization across diverse platforms. Finally, an Interaction & Semantic User Interface (IS-UI) layer enhances traditional Chinese cultural understanding. Results demonstrates that the proposed PSAR achieved improved rendering performance in term of Frames Per Second (FPS) of 118.3, when compared with the existing LOD-VR model."

    "abstract": "Because deep learning approaches are better at handling complicated noise patterns, the field of picture denoising has embraced them more and more. When it comes to handling different kinds of noise, especially Gaussian and realworld noise, different deep learning models show distinct advantages. Large-scale datasets and sophisticated optimization techniques help these models perform better when it comes to estimating and reducing noise artifacts. Although significant progress has been made in the domain of image denoising, a comprehensive and structured classification of the diverse methodologies remains underdeveloped. This study seeks to fill that gap by offering a critical and organized review of recent advancements in deep learning-based denoising techniques. It highlights both traditional approaches and more recent hybrid models. Through the use of widely recognized benchmark datasets, this review examines the performance of leading denoising algorithms, especially in complex scenarios where images suffer from multiple forms of degradation. In addition, the work explores how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) manage various types of noise, providing insights into their practical effectiveness. The paper concludes by identifying key challenges that continue to hinder progress in the field and suggests promising avenues for future investigation."

    "abstract": "Extended Reality (XR) faces adoption barriers in professional workspaces, a challenge beyond mere technical limitations. This position paper discusses that an underestimated limitation could be Visual Dissonance: a fundamental conflict between the consumer-grade aesthetics of many XR systems and the established visual culture of professional workspaces. This dissonance may undermine XR credibility and trigger user distrust, an issue that traditional technology acceptance models are not adequately able to capture. As contribution, we discuss theoretical backgrounds and speculate methodological solutions for achieving Visual Acceptance, which requires the development of a Native Visual Language for professional workspaces XR based on: (1) Visual User-Centered Design to respect professional aesthetic boundaries; (2) the formulation of a Native Visual Language that leverages XR’s unique spatial affordances instead of replicating 2D paradigms; and (3) Dynamic Visual Scaling, a method for contextually adapting visual formality. By defining this agenda, this paper aims to shift the research focus from purely technical optimization toward a design-centric approach, paving the way for the validation of adaptive visual systems and the establishment of new metrics for long-term XR adoption in workspaces."

Hence, as a solution, we propose the Forensic Immersive Framework (FIF), a structured guideline designed to integrate legal compliance, ethical safeguards, and technical best practices. This framework aims to support the development of user-centred VR applications in FMHS contexts. FIF emphasises actionable strategies to ensure privacy, autonomy, cultural inclusivity, and system reliability within secure environments.

Various and heterogeneous devices are increasingly included in IoV, which greatly facilitates people's lives, from navigation, charging, refueling, and other aspects. However, numerous devices in the IoV also bring serious security problems. Communications between vehicle entities and service entities are always exposed to powerful adversaries who can eavesdrop, intercept, and tamper communication messages. Besides, users' personal information faces leakage risks that seriously threaten people's life security (either passengers or pedestrians). Authentication and key agreement schemes for IoV are neither able to resist quantum attacks nor communication efficient. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a lattice-based anonymous certificateless authentication and key agreement scheme, PQACLA, for secure communication between vehicular entities and service entities. The PQACLA scheme leverages pseudonym identity technology and conditional malicious tracking to realize and guarantee the vehicle entities' anonymity and untraceability. Adopting provable security, the PQACLA scheme is proved secure under the random oracle model. Its security is also verified using the Scyther formal tool and informal security analysis. Compared to relative schemes, the PQACLA scheme behaves better, as its communication cost and computation cost are well balanced in total."

We evaluated a threshold-based finite-state machine trained via machine learning across 18 subjects using two exoskeletons, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">eWalk</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">autonomyo</i>.

    "abstract": "Inland waterbody detection (IWD), which aims at identifying and mapping waterbodies such as rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, is critical for water resources management and agricultural planning. However, the development of high-fidelity IWD mapping technology remains unresolved. We aim to propose a practical solution using only the easily accessible delay-Doppler map (DDM) data provided by NASA’s Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS), which facilitates effective estimation of physical parameters on the Earth’s surface with high temporal resolution and wide spatial coverage. Specifically, as quantum deep network (QUEEN) has revealed its strong proficiency in addressing classification-like tasks, we encode the DDM using a customized transformer, followed by feeding the transformer-encoded DDM (tDDM) into a highly entangled QUEEN to distinguish whether the tDDM corresponds to a hydrological region. In recent literature, QUEEN has achieved outstanding performances in numerous challenging remote sensing tasks (e.g., hyperspectral restoration, change detection, and mixed noise removal, etc.), and its high effectiveness stems from the fundamentally different way it adopts to extract features (the so-called quantum unitary-computing features). The meticulously designed IWD-QUEEN retrieves high-precision river textures, such as those in Amazon River Basin in South America, demonstrating its superiority over traditional classification methods and existing global hydrography maps. IWD-QUEEN, together with its parallel quantum multihead scheme, works in a near-real-time manner (i.e., millisecond-level computing per DDM data). To broaden accessibility for users of traditional computers, we also provide the non-quantum counterpart of our method, called IWD-Transformer, thereby increasing the impact of this work. In terms of quantitative evaluation, IWD-QUEEN leads the IWD-Transformer by approximately 7% and 8% in F1-score and Cohen’s kappa, respectively, alluding the promising role of QUEEN in achieving high-performance detection.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training but faces critical challenges in jointly optimizing privacy, accuracy, and communication efficiency, essential for resource-constrained wireless IoT deployments. We introduce ADP-QFed, an Adaptive Differentially Private Quantized Federated Learning framework that addresses these challenges through layer-wise adaptive noise injection and dual-bit deterministic quantization. By computing layer-specific sensitivity and importance scores, ADP-QFed dynamically calibrates privacy noise to minimize accuracy loss while ensuring rigorous (ε, δ)-differential privacy guarantees. The framework employs n-bit quantization for local computation and m-bit quantization for transmission, reducing communication overhead by up to 75%. Experiments on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 achieve test accuracies of 99.41%, 91.06%, and 82.94%, respectively, outperforming existing privacy-preserving FL methods by an average of 3.5%. These results are obtained while maintaining a privacy budget under ε = 2.25, representing a 40% reduction compared to state-of-the-art methods at similar accuracy levels. ADP-QFed advances practical privacy-preserving FL for edge sensing in low-altitude IoT systems by simultaneously optimizing privacy guarantees, model utility, and energy efficiency in wireless environments."

    "abstract": "Recently, Bird’s-Eye View (BEV) representation has received increasing attention in multi-view 3D object detection. However, training high-performance camera-based BEV 3D detectors typically requires cumbersome annotated training samples. In this challenging scenario, we are the pioneers in addressing the problem of semi-supervised BEV 3D object detection. To this end, we propose object-guided semi-supervised BEV 3D object detection (OSS3D), which trains the 3D detectors by using a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to reduce the cost of data labeling. Firstly, our approach employs an object-guided Gaussian-like mask generation paired with multi-perspective geometric correspondence to emphasize foreground regions and mitigate background noise, ensuring accurate object alignment across different spaces. Additionally, this Gaussian-like mask is integral to our object-guided deep feature map supervision strategy. Secondly, in order to avoid the impact of unreliable pseudo-labels on student network training and improve the importance of object depth information in real space, we propose a self-training depth-based refinement algorithm to generate high-quality and stable pseudo-labels. Finally, our method can be easily inserted into a variety of BEV 3D detection networks. Several experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms current semi-supervised approaches by 2.59% mAP and 2.94% NDS in the nuScenes dataset, achieving new state-of-the-art (SOTA) compared to various camera-based 3D detectors.

    "abstract": "This study proposes a simple Internet of Things (IoT)-based fall detection system with high coverage and privacy preservation to detect people’s status in private areas, such as washrooms. Human detection is crucial to prevent treatment delays because falls can lead to serious injuries or death. The proposed system utilizes a two-thermal-sensor configuration with top and side sensors to detect humans and perform fall detection. The number of top and side sensors used depends on the size of the detected area. The system incorporates the narrowband (NB)-IoT technology to facilitate communication between servers and sensors as a bridge in this system. The fall detection circuit includes an NB-IoT module, a microcontroller unit (MCU), and a two-thermal-sensor configuration. This low-cost MCU connects to the sensors and performs computations to determine if a private area is occupied or not. Apart from high coverage and privacy preservation, a two-thermal-sensor configuration enhances the accuracy of the fall detection system. A convolutional neural network (CNN) can be added as an additional fall detection metric. This fully integrated system was already implemented in different commercial places, and four commercial places are demonstrated in this article. Experiments were performed via five cases to verify the performance of the proposed fall detection system. This system, compared with other technologies, has simple installation, low cost, high coverage, and privacy-preserving features."

    "abstract": "Understanding collaboration strategies and dynamic patterns among organizations with unequal status in megaproject technological innovation networks represents a critical research issue, as it profoundly influences the innovation performance and ultimate success of megaprojects. However, existing research inadequately addresses the significant impact of network characteristics and organizational status disparities on megaproject innovations. To address this gap, the study develops a complex network evolutionary game-theoretic model and leverages Tien-yow Jeme Civil Engineering Prize data to simulate stability conditions and dynamic patterns of inter-organizational collaboration. This paper verifies the model's equilibrium and stability conditions on random and scale-free networks, and conducts sensitivity analyses of several key factors in an empirical network, further confirming their robustness. Findings indicate that rationalizing the benefit-distribution system, reputation and punishment mechanisms can promote active collaboration within core organizations, while controlling spillover benefits helps to curb free-rider behavior in general organizations. Moreover, the appropriate configuration of these elements shall balance the fluctuations and inconsistencies between network-level indicators, not merely the organizational strategic transitions. This study offers project managers and scholars a novel theoretical lens for strategy evolution in collaborative networks and provides actionable insights for designing mechanisms that consider organizational heterogeneity to enhance innovation outcomes in megaprojects."

    "abstract": "Mining chains operating in adverse underground environments and experiencing elevated coal transportation volumes are susceptible to critical failures including overloading, chain jamming, and fracture due to their role as essential transmission components. Real-time chain strain monitoring systems provide continuous assessment capabilities and early warning of potential failure events. Conventional strain sensors employed for tension monitoring exhibit significant limitations including insufficient sensitivity, excessive power requirements, and substantial dimensional constraints. In this investigation, we have synthesized strain sensors specifically engineered for downhole applications by leveraging the exceptional properties of graphene and HfSe₂. The integration of HfSe₂ into graphene-based composites resulted in the formation of heterointerfaces, which enhanced the sensors' sensitivity and linearity. These sensors demonstrate superior performance characteristics, including enhanced gauge factor (GF=22.8) within the linear strain range of 0–2000 με, exceptional linearity (RL²=0.98), ultra-low detection threshold (100 με), and minimal power consumption (2.05 mW), while maintaining measurement accuracy across extreme thermal conditions (0°C-60°C). The acquired strain signals underwent Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis, with subsequent application of a Butterworth filter to attenuate high-frequency components and mitigate environmental noise interference. The developed graphene/HfSe₂-based strain sensor substantially enhances monitoring precision and operational safety, presenting significant implementation potential for advanced mine intelligence systems."

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) aims to detect novel object concepts by mining region-word correspondences from image-text pairs, yet current methods often produce false correspondences. While some strategies (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e.g.</i>, one-to-one matching) were proposed to mitigate this issue, they often sacrifice numerous valuable region-word pairs during the matching process. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel comprehensive alignment method, named Region-word Alignment with Partial Optimal Transport (ROOT) framework, which reframes the region-word matching task as a problem of partial distribution alignment. Unlike traditional optimal transport, which shifts the full mass of the distribution, partial optimal transport enables selective matching, making it more robust to noise in region and word alignment. Specifically, ROOT first employs partial optimal transport to obtain an optimal transport plan for region and word feature alignment. This transport plan is then used to compute a matching reliability score for each region-word pair, which reweights the contrastive alignment loss to enhance accuracy. By enabling more flexible and reliable region-text matches, ROOT significantly reduces misalignment errors while preserving valuable region–word correspondences. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks OV-COCO and OV-LVIS show that our ROOT outperforms the previous state-of-the-art works, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach."

    "abstract": "In congested or contested spectrum, radar is costly to operate due to high power usage, low spectral efficiency, and low covertness compared to passive sensors. For this reason this work proposes a multi-mode radar sensing strategy, in which the sensors can choose between a monostatic radar mode and a passive Electronic Support Measure (ESM) spectrum sensing mode. In ESM mode, a target is localized with a network of multi-mode sensors, which creates opportunities to reduce radar measurements. Radar and ESM measurements are rigorously compared using the Cramer-Rao bound to quantify the localization error of each mode. The best mode for each sensor is chosen using a Restless Contextual Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit (RCC-MAB) online learning algorithm. The RCC-MAB increases the flexibility of the network by adapting to the target in real-time based on recent radar and ESM measurements. Two variants, the ϵ-Greedy and Covert RCC-MABs, were created to fulfill different tracking objectives. The ϵ-Greedy RCC-MAB variant seeks to minimize the tracking error by selecting the best sensing modes based on the quality of previous measurements and the current context of the tracking filter. The Covert RCC-MAB variant significantly reduces radar usage to stay covert, or minimize access to a shared spectrum, by only exploring radar measurements when the tracking error approaches a predefined maximum error. The ϵ-Greedy RCC-MAB consistently achieved the lowest tracking error of the tested mode controllers, 58% and 16% lower than a single-mode radar and ESM network, respectively, when the radio emissions of opportunity were available during 50% of measurement opportunities. In the same scenario, the Covert RCC-MAB had 55% lower tracking error than single-mode radar, while using 82% less radar than the ϵ-Greedy RCC-MAB."

In order to maintain the integrity of votes and promise a safe, open, and verifiable process, voting methods have changed from paper ballot systems to electronic voting systems. The progress of a safe electronic voting system that prevents fraud endeavors and yields dependable vote results has been in progress. In order to solve these problems, we present a novel strategy in this work that uses a association blockchain, smart contracts (SCs), and cryptographic approaches to protect votes, improve voter privacy, and speed up outcome collecting. Each vote is recorded as a operation on a decentralized ledger by the planned electronic voting scheme, which makes use of blockchain technology. The system architecture is shown in Figure 1, where voters can safely register and cast their ballots via a frontend user interface. The procedure is controlled by smart contracts, which pledge that votes are verifiable and unchangeable. Data confidentiality is protected by a cryptographic layer, and voter eligibility is verified by the system's integration with government databases. Our implementation findings show that our suggested method outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of energy usage, execution time, and scalability."

In this paper, a torque pulsation control strategy based on the composite convergence law with double sliding mode controller is proposed. In the speed control layer, the sliding mode speed controller is constructed to eliminate the sliding mode arrival stage, combined with the non-singular fast terminal sliding mode function to realize the fast convergence of the system in all stages, and the composite convergence law and the segment switching function are designed to optimize the convergence speed and suppress the jitter in collaboration; in the torque control layer, the improved hysteresis loop strategy of demagnetization signal is introduced to suppress the torque overshoot phenomenon of the rotor during the unidirectional conduction interval. In order to enhance the system anti-disturbance capability, a sliding mode disturbance observer is designed for real-time observation of internal and external disturbances such as load fluctuation and parameter mismatch, and the disturbance valuation is feed-forward compensated to the double-sliding mode controller, forming a closed-loop observation-compensation mechanism. A 6/4 motor is simulated and verified, and the results show that the new control strategy can effectively reduce the torque pulsation, and compared with the traditional sliding-mode control and the improved sliding-mode control, the dual-sliding-mode control method using the composite convergence law not only improves the dynamic performance of the system, shortens the dynamic response time, but also strengthens the anti-disturbance performance of the motor and further reduces the torque pulsation."

    "abstract": "Upper limb motor dysfunction in patients with stroke could limit their daily activities, and virtual reality (VR) has been proven to provide interactive training for enhancing rehabilitation. However, many studies presume independent tasks, which can be challenging for patients with limited motor control. The virtual co-embodiment method in VR has the potential to allow patients and therapists to share the same avatar to collaboratively perform rehabilitation tasks. Specifically, this method could impact the patients’ agency (feeling of controlling virtual avatars) and enable therapists to compensate for patients’ limited mobility. Prior research has shown that the avatar’s first or third-person perspective can affect the agency, but studies on co-embodiment have not yet examined how these two users’ perspectives influence their experiences. Our study investigates how first or third-person perspectives for both patients and therapists moderate the agency during VR co-embodiment. We found that differences in participants’ roles and objectives influence participants’ perspective preferences during VR co-embodiment. These findings inform the design of multi-user collaboration to enhance patients’ motor recovery in VR rehabilitation."

LIBs must be maintained within a $20-40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ temperature range, limiting temperature gradients within a cell and between cells to $\\lt 5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. The study uses the Newman, Tiedemann, Gu. and Kim (NTGK) Multi-Scale Multi-Domain (MSMD) battery model in ANSYS Fluent to simulate a static immersion cooling system employing natural convection heat transfer. First, a $50 \\mathrm{Ah} \\mathrm{LiFePO}_{4}$ prismatic battery is fully immersed in air, with performance compared to immersion in the dielectric liquids deionized water and Novec 7000 for discharge rates of 1 to 3 times the nominal current. Then, two hybrid systems combining both dielectric liquid and air are investigated for comparison. The hybrid systems use smaller volumes of dielectric liquid, and a configuration that requires only $68 \\%$ of dielectric liquid in comparison to full immersion cooling exhibited good performance by maintaining a maximum battery surface temperature difference of less than $5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and limiting the maximum battery temperature to $\\lt 40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. However, the hybrid system using the smallest volume of those investigated, in which static liquid cooling is applied only to the top face of the battery, leads to poor thermal performance."

    "abstract": "This project tackles the design of a stand-alone, or \"islanded,\" DC microgrid system for green hydrogen production utilizing renewable solar energy and an energy storage system (ESS). The system is designed to create a clean, efficient, and independent energy source that is not dependent on the conventional power grid. The system uses solar photovoltaic (PV) panels to harvest solar energy and convert it into electricity. As solar energy is not always present, particularly during cloudy weather or nighttime, a battery-based energy storage system is incorporated to accumulate excess electricity and release it during demand. The stored energy supplies an electrolyzer, a device that decomposes water into hydrogen and oxygen. The generated hydrogen can be stored and utilized later as a clean energy source for multiple applications, such as in fuel cells, transportation, or industrial processes. The entire system is regulated by a control unit that coordinates energy generation, storage, and utilization to achieve stable and efficient operation even under fluctuating solar conditions. Simulation results indicate that the system can supply a continuous power supply to the electrolyzer, resulting in continuous hydrogen production with negligible wastage of energy. Such a microgrid configuration is particularly beneficial in remote or off-grid locations where conventional energy sources are not available. It complements the world's transition towards renewable energy and presents a viable means of decentralized hydrogen production utilizing renewable resources."

From here, this paper employs density map modeling with Edge Intelligence (Edge-AI) technology to identify the On-Shelf Availability (OSA) index in retailers. A lightweight and efficient variant of the Multi-Column Convolutional Neural Network (MCNN), referred to as Modified Multi-Column Convolutional Neural Network (mMCNN), is proposed for edge-based density estimation. Moreover, a novel dataset called AgriShelf is curated to serve as a benchmark for this application. Extensive tests on edge platforms, Jetson Nano and Jetson Orin Nano, show that mMCNN outperforms the original MCNN in computational efficiency, with only a nominal drop in counting accuracy. Notably, Jetson Orin Nano achieves superior performance, reaching an inference speed of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{0. 0 1 5}$</tex> seconds.

The results demonstrate that the rectangular fin structure, owing to its larger contact area and more uniform gas-liquid distribution, exhibits a lower steady-state operating temperature and thermal resistance, indicating superior thermal conduction capability. The triangular-fin structure demonstrates faster thermal responsiveness and stabilization tendencies. The sharp-edge design effectively facilitates bubble nucleation and rapid detachment during the heating phase, accelerating the establishment of a stable circulation loop. However, it also leads to non-uniform temperature distribution and elevated local thermal resistance, thereby reducing overall thermal uniformity.

    "abstract": "Traditional Kalman filters require real-time computation of prior error covariance, posterior error covariance, and Kalman filter gain when estimating the state of charge (SOC) of lithium-ion batteries. This involves a large number of matrix operations, necessitating the deployment of battery management system (BMS) on high-performance embedded hardware systems and thereby increasing the system implementation cost. To address this issue, this paper proposes an battery SOC estimation method based on the steady-state Kalman filter (SKF). The method calculates the steady-state Kalman gain offline using the Hamiltonian algorithm and embeds it into the filter, thereby avoiding a large number of mathematical operations during runtime. Experimental results show that this method has a SOC estimation accuracy comparable to that of the linear Kalman filter (KF), but it exhibits significant advantages in terms of runtime and memory usage, with a runtime of only 1.9% and a memory usage of only 14.6% of the KF. The new method can achieve efficient SOC estimation without the need of high-performance embedded hardware platforms, and it has high practical value and broad application prospects."

This paper presents a thorough evaluation and comparison of different methods by considering the integration of optimization techniques into multilevel thresholding systems.

    "abstract": "Structural deviations are atypical patterns known in environmental psychology literature to cause discomfort in physical spaces, however their impact on user perception within immersive virtual remains under-explored. Therefore, this work contributes by exploring how Structural deviations (Void, Defeatured, Symmetry, Repetition, Displacement, Big, Small, Presence) known in literature disrupt the Plausibility Illusion (PI the sense that virtual space seem real) and Place Illusion (Psi the feeling of being present). We designed two Metaverse inspired case studies: outdoor city avenue and an indoor pub, both with nine scenes each implanted by a single structural deviation. We ran a mixed-methods user study (N=46), in which participants were assigned to a Metaverse (between-subjects). All viewed a baseline, then several counterbalanced SDs (within-subjects), rating perceived realism (for PI) and uncanniness (for breaches of Psi). Statistical analysis (RM-ANOVA, Bonferroni) showed that all Structural Deviations significantly increased uncanniness and weakened Psi (p ≤ .001). Only Displacement and Big significantly reduced PI, with GLM identifying them as the strongest predictors of uncanniness. This work showcased how Structural deviations can be used as deliberate design choices to affect significantly the user experience, and how further studies in perception theory are needed to further explore designers’ tools for crafting next-gen IVEs."

    "abstract": "With the increasing penetration of wind power in modern power systems, grid inertia is significantly reduced, posing a serious challenge to frequency stability. The Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) has flexible control capability, but the decoupling of its rotor speed from the grid frequency results in a lack of inertial response. Although the droop control technique can engage the DFIG in frequency regulation by releasing the rotor kinetic energy, most of the existing studies are based on the assumption of constant wind speed, which ignores the effect of actual wind speed fluctuations on the stability of the wind turbine. In this paper, the problem of DFIG rotational speed stability using droop control under variable wind speed conditions is investigated, and a frequency response model is developed and the nonlinear aspects such as mechanical power and maximum power tracking (MPPT) are linearised. The steady state rotational speed as a function of wind speed is revealed through theoretical derivation, and the value of the droop coefficient K<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</inf> is determined based on the range of wind speed fluctuation.

In this paper, the dynamic electrical-thermal-fluid coupling in the alkaline electrolysis system model is analyzed, and the electrolyte circulation is controlled to enhance the temperature control responsiveness. Furthermore, the coordinated proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers are designed, integrating stack temperature regulation with chiller and circulating pump power control to address nonlinear thermal dynamic control. By leveraging thermal-fluid interaction through active electrolyte flow rate adjustment, the controllers achieve improved temperature stabilization under variable operating scenarios.

It combines graph-based global search algorithms with reinforcement learning (RL) for adaptive local path adjustments, allowing UAVs to navigate autonomously in complex settings. MATLAB simulations used a vowelized BIM model to test UAV responses to real-time sensor data, including smoke density and temperature changes.

    "abstract": "The use of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar photovoltaic, for electricity Generation in Brazil has grown exponentially over the last few years. However, the full integration of these sources into the National Interconnected System (SIN) has been challenged mainly by the unavailability of instantaneous allocation of all energy generated in the load. As a result, events restricting the operation of centralized power plants, defined as constrained-off, have occurred increasingly over the last four years, generating significant financial losses. In this context, this article aims to propose a technical and financial analysis of the use of energy not generated in the system due to constrained-off in photovoltaic and wind power plants located in Paraíba, through the use of energy storage systems. The system is designed to operate in three scenarios, the viability of which has been proven when the three are integrated into a single approach."

    "abstract": "The continuous advancement of photovoltaic energy sources demands constant improvements in their systems to ensure efficiency and reliability. This article investigates the implementation of a transition between continuous and discontinuous modulation techniques in a photovoltaic inverter to improve its reliability, triggered by an active thermal control system. Typically, the semiconductors used in photovoltaic inverters are subjected to high operating temperatures due to conduction losses and, mainly, switching losses. Discontinuous modulation techniques are well-known for mitigating switching losses, although this comes at the expense of reduced power quality. The proposed transition between modulation strategies seeks to enhance the reliability of the system's components while ensuring that the generated power quality remains within the limits defined by current technical standards. The main objective is to reduce thermal impacts that affect their reliability. The evaluation of the methodology is based on the analysis of semiconductor device junction temperature, allowing for the estimation of their lifetime and the examination of the effect of total harmonic distortion on the power grid. Using the proposed model in a two-level photovoltaic inverter, based on simulation results, improvements in its useful life of up to 44.44 % were obtained, while maintaining the THD below 5 %. The obtained results are expected to encourage the adoption of the proposed strategy, contributing to the longevity of photovoltaic inverters and, consequently, to greater stability and reliability of power generation systems. The approach aims to drive significant improvements in photovoltaic technology, strengthening its large-scale application."

This paper presents GreenSterz Solution, an integrated approach that utilizes a data handling system for medical sharps waste management and a solar-powered autoclave system for sterilization. The proposed system aims to address two critical issues: improving the transparency and efficiency of waste disposal processes through a web application and reducing reliance on unstable energy sources by utilizing solar energy for autoclave operation. The integration of Internet of Things sensors enables real-time monitoring of waste metrics and autoclave operations, ensuring consistent performance and accountability.

To address issues such as high path redundancy, frequent directional changes, and excessive energy usage in large-scale UAV mapping tasks, this paper proposes a path planning method based on an improved Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. Specifically, a connectivity-based labeling function is introduced to constrain the path expansion direction and reduce invalid searches; in addition, a directional search function is designed to optimize the search order of neighboring nodes, thereby improving path continuity and planning efficiency. Simulation results show that the improved algorithm outperforms the traditional DFS in terms of path redundancy, number of turns, and total steps."

    "abstract": "A smart microgrid is a localized system that is a scaled-down version of a smart grid that integrates power-related technology with information and communication technology in a controlled area, such as a campus, neighborhood, or small community. However, the network connectivity that empowers smart microgrids also introduces security vulnerabilities that make microgrid systems prime targets for cyberattacks. The attackers can target the microgrid system to disrupt energy distribution, and compromise the communication channel, which may lead to severe consequences for the local communities. In literature, significant research has been conducted on cybersecurity in broader power systems, but fewer studies have focused specifically on the unique challenges of smart microgrids. The localized nature and small scale of microgrids require customized cybersecurity approaches, which are still under-explored. The proposed research addresses the challenge of deploying reliable and efficient smart microgrids in real-world scenarios by introducing a dynamic threat modeling framework. The purpose of this framework is to simulate and analyze potential cyber threats to smart microgrids and assess vulnerabilities in terms of risk and impact. Significant progress has been made in the development and simulation of this dynamic threat modeling framework."

There is a need to develop both single- and two-phase liquid cooling solutions to provide energy-efficient thermal management of high-performance AI systems while eliminating water consumption and maintaining system reliability in any geographical location. In this work, previously developed component-/system-level modeling tools were adapted to evaluate the performance of above-ambient pumped two-phase liquid cooling of a multi-server rack under different operating scenarios and geographical locations. The tool was used to compare both component level and system level cooling performance (thermal resistances, pumping power, cooling coefficient of performance, etc.) of utilizing different dielectric coolants (such as R1234ze(E), R1234ze(Z), R1233zd(E), etc.) in the two-phase cooling loop. The system level model was utilized to understand the two-phase cooling system performance under different operating scenarios including (i) for an exemplar control scheme where facility side temperature was controlled to a set-point, (ii) for different internal/external loop pump and dry-cooler fan speeds, (iii) over a typical meteorological year at different US cities, and (iv) for performance comparison among different refrigerants at the same target exit vapor quality, etc. Results indicate medium-pressure (e.g. R1234ze(Z)) or high-pressure (e.g. R134a, R1234ze(E)) refrigerants produce better component as well as system level performance compared to lowpressure (e.g. $\\mathbf{R 1 2 3 3 z d}(\\mathbf{E}), \\mathbf{R 1 3 3 6 m z z}(\\mathbf{Z}))$ refrigerants."

It is a challenging task for Myanmar (Burmese) and other Asian languages such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Thai, which lack whitespace to mark word boundaries. This paper aims to identify the most accurate approach for Burmese word segmentation by evaluating six models based on neural and statistical methods. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) represent the neural approaches, while Conditional Random Field (CRF) serves as a statistical method. Three hybrid models—BiLSTM-CRF, BiLSTM-Attention, and BiLSTM-Attention-CRF—are also developed and examined. In addition to standard evaluation metrics, a boundary-based error analysis is employed to assess missed, false, and shifted boundaries, providing a finer measure of segmentation accuracy beyond token-level evaluation. The models are tested on a manually segmented corpus derived from a cleaned raw dataset. Experimental results show that the hybrid BiLSTM-CRF model achieves the best performance, with a precision of 97.12%, recall of 97.91%, and F1-score of 95.2%. These findings demonstrate that the hybrid approach is robust and effective, supporting accurate segmentation for real-world Burmese NLP applications and improving foundational tools for downstream language processing tasks."

Moreover, by comparing the proposed models, we disclose the conditions under which these two models are equivalent, thus simplifying the two-paralleled GFMC system to a one-GFMC infinite-bus system.

However, existing frameworks still face significant challenges, including non-IID data distribution across patients and high communication costs in resource-constrained wearables. To address these limitations, we propose a drift-aware prototype Clustering (DAPC)-enabled Federated Learning Framework (FL) for personalized healthcare diagnostics. Initially, data collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) raw wearable signals were denoised and normalized, followed by feature extraction from physiological and activity data. Each device then generates a lightweight prototype vector to summarize its data distribution. At the edge server, the prototypes are clustered using cosine similarity to form user groups with similar health patterns. Federated aggregation is performed within each cluster, and drift detection dynamically reassigns the devices during user behavior. Finally, a personalized adapter layer was fine-tuned on each device, and the optimized TinyML model was deployed for real-time lowlatency diagnostics. Experimental results show that the proposed DAPC-FL attains higher results than the existing model FL-Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) in terms of accuracy (98 %), precision (98 %), recall (97 %), and F1-score (97 %)."

However, the existing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based 3D clothing design framework faces limitations, such as reliance on static body data, lack of ability to handle long-range dependencies, and limited applicability to dynamic clothing design. Hence, a novel hybrid Convolutional Neural Network with Swin Transformer (CNN-SwinTrans) is proposed for intelligent clothing design. First, real-world 3D body scans and 3D garments across multiple poses are collected from the CLOTH3D dataset. Next, the collected data underwent preprocessing through Laplacian smoothing to remove mesh noise and min-max normalization to ensure consistency. Furthermore, CNN-SwinTrans is employed for feature extraction, where CNN captures local features, while the transformer encodes global garment-body relationships. Body measurements are then computed to guide 3D garment modeling, which is further enhanced through void volume modeling and pose-conditioned adaptation. Finally, clothing pattern generation is performed using segmentation, least squares conformal mapping with as rigid as possible optimization for flattening seam adjustment, and nesting to minimize material waste. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CNN-SwinTrans framework achieves greater recognition accuracy (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 6. 8 4 \\%}$</tex>) by improving intelligent clothing design performance."

    "abstract": "Bio-oil aging represents a critical indicator of its inherent instability, posing significant challenges for storage and upgrading. Free radicals may be responsible for triggering the polymerization of bio-oil components; however, detailed characterization of their dynamic evolution during prolonged aging remains underexplored. This study employed guaiacol as a model compound to detect changes in the quantity and types of free radicals in pyrolysis oil. The aging processes were classified to sealed and air-exposed at room temperature, respectively. Under sealed conditions, the results revealed a weak correlation between free radical presence and bio-oil aging progression, with radical characteristics demonstrating remarkable stability throughout the observation period. Conversely, atmospheric exposure induced significant alterations in radical behavior. Oxygen ingress triggered a progressive decline in radical spin concentration, stabilizing to equilibrium levels by day six. This attenuation pattern correlates with oxidative radical termination mechanisms and concurrent transformations of oxygen-containing functional groups during bio-oil degradation. These findings establish an analytical framework for elucidating the chemical kinetics of bio-oil aging through radical monitoring."

Traditional methods involve creating virtual scenarios in VR to simulate interactions, but they often rely on pre-defined 3D assets or procedural generation, which are time-consuming, expensive, and limited by restricted design options and the need for 3D expertise. Many systems are also desktop-based and lack intuitive interfaces, limiting interactive scenario creation and in-place testing. This paper presents an integrated XR-based system that combines GenAI based 3D scenario generation and human-robot collaboration in real-time. It allows users to create and modify virtual environments on-the-fly using voice and gesture inputs, and test collaborations directly in mixed reality, accelerating decision-making. The system, powered by Generative AI and XR, enables even non-experts to generate 3D assets, assemble them, configure robots, and perform collaborative tasks. It features an intuitive interface and multiple configuration options. Through experiments and ablations, the system’s effectiveness is validated, showing its potential for interactive 3D scenario creation and in-place collaboration in XR, with applications in robotics, gaming and other fields."

    "abstract": "In this study, approaches to the development of interactive Java algorithms intended for dynamic visualization of parallel computational threads were considered. The proposed interactive Java algorithms give an opportunity to create visual graphical representations of parallel processes, their interactions, and data distribution. Within the framework of the research the key approaches to visualization of parallel computational flows are analyzed, the peculiarities of the applied interactive components are estimated and the methods of integration with existing monitoring and debugging systems are considered. With the help of configurable visualization tools, developers and researchers can observe the evolution of computational threads, evaluate the performance of systems and timely react to changes in the structure of parallel tasks. Implementing algorithms on the Java platform ensures portability, broad applicability, and integration with existing frameworks for high-performance computing. The use of dynamic data structures, thread-safe collections and parallelism mechanisms implemented in the language and standard libraries allows efficiently processing large amounts of data in real time. In addition, Java Virtual Machine provides profiling tools that can be directly applied to optimize the visualized processes."

    "abstract": "Current methods for restoring underexposed images typically rely on supervised learning with paired underexposed and well-illuminated images. However, collecting such datasets is often impractical in real-world scenarios. Moreover, these methods can lead to over-enhancement, distorting well-illuminated regions. To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a Zero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image, without requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong generalization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring illumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising module. The former separates the image into illumination and reflection components via a dense connection network, while the latter enhances non-uniformly illuminated regions using an illumination-guided pixel adaptive correction method. A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined iteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under complex lighting conditions. Quantitative results on metrics like PSNR (20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB) show that it outperforms 14 stat-eof-the-art unsupervised methods."

We characterise the boundary between the dense and sparse regimes under the above two tail conditions for the first time in the change point literature and propose novel testing procedures that attain optimal rates in each of the four regimes up to a poly-iterated logarithmic factor. To be specific, when the error distributions possess exponentially-decaying tails, a near-optimal CUSUM-type statistic is considered. As for polynomially-decaying tails, admitting bounded α-th moments for some α ≥ 4, we introduce a median-of-means-type test statistic that achieves a near-optimal testing rate in both dense and sparse regimes. Our investigation in the even more challenging case of 2 ≤ α < 4, unveils a new phenomenon that the minimax testing rate has no sparse regime, i.e. testing sparse changes is information-theoretically as hard as testing dense changes. Finally, we consider various extensions where we also obtain near-optimal performances, including testing against multiple change points, allowing temporal dependence as well as fewer than two finite moments in the data generating mechanisms. We also show how sub-Gaussian rates can be achieved when an additional minimal spacing condition is imposed under the alternative hypothesis."

We formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem that jointly optimizes a dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC)-empowered base station (BS), considering its ISAC-based active beamforming, along with the passive STARS beamforming configurations of amplitudes, phase shifts, quantization levels, and element selection. Furthermore, relaxed/independent/coupled STARS are considered to examine architectural flexibility. To tackle the non-convex and mixed-integer problem, we propose a joint active-passive beamforming, quantization and element selection (AQUES) scheme based on the alternating optimization: Lagrangian dual and Dinkelbach’s transformation tackle fractional equations, whereas successive convex approximation (SCA) convexifies the non-solvable problem; Penalty dual decomposition (PDD) framework and penalty-based convex-concave programming (PCCP) procedure solve amplitude and phase-shifts with the equality constraint; Heuristic search iteratively decides the optimal quantization level; Integer relaxation deals with the discrete element selection variables. Simulation results demonstrate that STARS-ISAC with the proposed AQUES scheme significantly enhances EE while meeting communication rates and sensing quality requirements. The coupled STARS further highlights its superior EE performance over independent and relaxed STARS thanks to its reduced hardware complexity. Moreover, AQUES outperforms existing configurations and benchmark methods in the open literature across various network parameters and deployment scenarios."

    "abstract": "Existing robotic grasp detection methods often struggle with inaccurate predictions in complex scenarios involving multiple objects and textured backgrounds. Most existing methods attempt to enhance CNN-based architectures to improve grasp accuracy. However, their limited receptive fields and ineffective multiscale feature integration hinder handling objects of varying sizes, and performance degrades when local salient features are disturbed. To address these limitations, we propose a Swin Transformer-based grasp detection framework. It features a hierarchical Swin Transformer encoder that models both global contextual dependencies and local features through shifted-window and window attention mechanisms. In addition, we introduce a multiscale transformer pyramid pooling module that dynamically processes and fuses multiscale features, enabling the network to adjust grasp predictions based on object scales. Finally, a lightweight CNN decoder is designed to optimize multiscale feature fusion while maintaining spatial precision. Our method achieves accuracies of 98.9% and 96.7% on the Cornell and Jacquard datasets, respectively. Moreover, the network demonstrates real-time performance with a prediction rate of 27 fps. We conduct comparative experiments, ablation experiments, and real-world grasping experiments on the UR3 robot, achieving a 96.0% success rate."

To provide the same baseline for comparison of the EMC performance across these standards, the maximum-to-maximum ratio of the total electric field to its rectangular component should be determined. For this, we propose the sampling-based and the solution-set-based methods for the estimation of maximum values, from which the maximum-to-maximum ratio can be derived. According to the numerical analysis, moreover, provided that a clear boundary, i.e., the quantile for a given probability, has been defined for the distributions of the electric field component and the total electric field, the sampling-based method can offer a simple and more intuitive solution that shows good agreement with the results reported in the literature."

    "abstract": "The key goals in developing power electronics converters for today’s demanding applications and industry are achieving high power density, high efficiency, and low cost. However, as power electronics become more integrated and closely packaged, they become more susceptible to the disruptive effects of electromagnetic interference (EMI), which is a challenge for embedded and integrated designs. This research focuses on the signal integrity and EMI performance evaluation of a new bare-die embedded PCB packaging technology, ensuring a very compact, high power density, and integrated design for the power electronics unit. The design incorporates the bare die of the switching devices into the PCB layers and uses multilayers for routing and cooling purposes. A Silicon (Si) MOSFET bare-die is embedded into the FR4 layers using the stomach cell approach, electrically connected, and cooled through laser-drilled micro vias and copper fills. The electrothermal codesign reduces the parasitic loop inductance by 74% and increases the power density by 113%. This research, through analysis and experimental results, evaluates the signal integrity and EMI performance, including conductive emissions, radiated emissions, insertion loss, reflective loss, cross talk, and susceptibility analysis, according to industry standards (CISPR25) to establish the superior performance of the proposed bare-die embedding technique through a benchmark comparison with the traditional PCB design. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first paper to explore the EMI perspective on a system level for bare-die or active components embedded PCB design."

    "abstract": "The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) introduces programmability and intelligence into wireless infrastructure, making it a promising enabler of reliable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication in complex urban environments. Unlike traditional RAN, O-RAN’s disaggregated architecture and RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) allow real-time adaptation to Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) challenges, an issue unresolved in many existing V2X systems. This paper proposes an adaptive relaying framework that leverages the near-real-time RIC to dynamically enhance V2X reliability through dynamic relay selection and interference-aware resource coordination. The architecture supports programmable fallback relaying using disaggregated O-DU/O-RU units at roadside infrastructure, enabling low-latency two-hop paths when direct sidelink communication fails. To evaluate performance, a semi-analytical model is developed based on Moment Matching Approximation (MMA), capturing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) under composite Nakagami-lognormal fading and stochastic co-channel interference. The framework integrates O-RAN with NR-V2X sidelink communication to bridge the gap between centralized and adhoc vehicular networks. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed O-RAN-aided relaying improves Packet Success Probability (PSP) in dense NLOS scenarios, consistently achieving a PSP above 90%. The framework outperforms conventional LOS and NLOS approaches while maintaining compatibility with 3GPP Release 18 and O-RAN Alliance specifications, ensuring practical deployability in future intelligent transportation systems (ITS)."

Instead of linking motion to a humanoid avatar, the prototype reflects user movements through a virtual animal character. This design is based on clinical feedback indicating that interaction with animals can enhance patient motivation. The system was developed using IMU and camera-based sensors to examine the feasibility of motion tracking in supine positions.

    "abstract": "Modern power systems' dependability and efficiency depend on the best scheduling of many energy supplies, including hydro, thermal, and renewable sources like wind. This work provides a new hybrid Grey Wolf Optimization (H-GWO) method for integrated scheduling of hydro-thermal systems enhanced with wind energy resources. The suggested approach improves convergence speed, solution accuracy, and resilience in addressing complicated, nonlinear, and non-convex scheduling problems by including adaptive control parameters and elite opposition-based learning, thereby augmenting the standard Grey Wolf Optimization technique. The hybrid scheduling framework considers multiple real-world constraints like water discharge restrictions, thermal unit ramp rates, wind-solar power variability, and spinning reserve needs. Minimizing the overall running cost of the power system is the aim, while nevertheless preserving the demand-supply balance and guaranteeing environmental sustainability. Simulations on a conventional hydro-thermal-wind-solar system benchmark confirm the efficacy of the proposed H-GWO method. Comparative study of genetic algorithms (GA), Teaching Learning based Optimization (TLBO), and other metaheuristic approaches shows that H-GWO excels in terms of cost reduction, convergence stability, and computing efficiency. The daily fuel cost amounts to $33,886.71, inclusive of sustainable wind-solar energy costs of $41,932.4879. The establishment of a sustainable wind and solar park has led to a decrease in emissions from 16,097.0396 lb/day to 6,247.9701 lb/day. Moreover, the method shows great capacity in allowing the stochastic character of wind and solar power, thus guaranteeing consistent grid integration. This study helps to create smart energy management plans that fit the increasing need for sustainable, robust, and economically feasible power system operations in the period of the renewable energy transition."

This paper proposes a Transformer-based approach for tool state recognition, addressing the limitations of traditional sequence models in handling multi-modal sensor data. By fusing vibration, acoustic emission, and current signals, the model utilizes the self-attention mechanism of the Transformer to effectively learn global temporal dependencies. Experiments conducted on a milling dataset show that the proposed approach outperforms LSTM and GRU models in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score, particularly in identifying tool failures.

Music is a universal form of expression, and people often share their emotional responses to songs in their native languages. Analyzing these comments in multiple languages is essential to fully capture diverse listener opinions and emotional reactions across cultures. This study employs multilingual sentiment analysis to construct linguistic resources for low-resource languages, such as Myanmar, by utilizing the strengths of high-resource languages like English. A balanced dataset of 17,000 comments (8,500 Myanmar and 8,500 English) was compiled, and a pretrained multilingual transformer model (XLM-RoBERTa) was fine-tuned for sentiment classification. The model achieved 90.1% accuracy on English-only comments, 85.3% on Myanmar-only comments, and 88.5% on the combined Myanmar-English test set, demonstrating reliable cross-lingual generalization. Experimental results show that the model performs well on both Myanmar and English comments, highlighting the effectiveness of multilingual sentiment analysis in capturing cross-cultural musical sentiment."

A novel combination of the scalable fabrication techniques femtosecond laser surface processing (FLSP) and hydrogen annealing (H2A) are utilized to produce functionalized copper (Cu) surfaces that have metallic surface chemistry and hierarchical micro- and nano-scale topography. The degree of nanoscale roughness of the laser processed surfaces is tunable with the post-laser processing H2A technique, lending a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of the nanoparticle overlayer without changing the microscale topography or surface chemistry. Varying the annealing temperature yields surfaces with nanoparticle sizes ranging from approximately 100 nm at the lowest annealing temperature to approximately $2.9 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ at the highest temperature. The annealing does not impact the microscale structures, so the impact of the nanoscale roughness can be studied directly. The boiling curves produced when pool boiling with these surfaces have a unique bimodal nature. The degree of nanoscale roughness affects the maximum HTC and CHF. The surface with the finest layer of nanoscale roughness achieved a $176 \\%$ increase in the maximum HTC and a $26.2 \\%$ increase in CHF over a polished Cu reference surface. The surface with the coarsest nanoparticle layer achieved a $341 \\%$ increase in the max HTC and a $33.4 \\%$ increase in CHF over a polished Cu reference surface."

    "abstract": "In order to solve the problems of low selectivity of overcurrent protection and large amount of data transmission of current differential protection after T-connected line fault in distribution network, a T-connected line protection method based on steady-state voltage transient current cosine similarity is proposed. By establishing the equivalent circuit diagram of the internal and external faults in the T-connected line area of the distribution network, it is found that the polarity of the transient fault current flowing through the switch measuring point device of the distribution line is different from that of the pre-fault steady-state voltage. Based on this, the cosine similarity is introduced to measure this difference, and the product sum of the similarity coefficients between the transient current fault component and the pre-fault steady-state voltage component at each switch is defined as the internal and external fault identification criterion of the T-connected line area. Based on PSCAD / EMTDC simulation software, the simulation model of distribution network with T-connected line system is built to verify the reliability of the proposed protection method. The simulation results show that the proposed protection method can accurately identify the internal and external faults within 5ms time window, and has strong resistance to transition resistance. At the same time, the proposed protection method has a small amount of data transmission, and has good speed and applicability."

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of photovoltaic (PV) power is crucial for grid scheduling, energy management, and the optimal operation of photovoltaic power plants. However, the time-series data of PV power exhibit high nonlinearity and randomness, influenced by factors such as weather and sunlight. Traditional prediction methods often fail to meet the high accuracy requirements. To address this issue, this paper proposes a short-term PV power prediction method based on Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction, and an Informer-LSTM hybrid model (VMD-PCA-Informer-LSTM). Firstly, VMD is applied to decompose the time-series data of PV power into multiple intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), effectively removing noise and capturing the frequency characteristics of PV power across different scales. Next, PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of the decomposed data, extracting key features, reducing redundancy, and improving model training efficiency. Finally, by combining the advantages of the Informer and LSTM deep learning models, an efficient hybrid prediction model is designed. The Informer's self-attention mechanism captures long-term dependencies, while LSTM is used to handle short-term temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the VMD-PCA-Informer-LSTM model performs exceptionally well on multiple PV datasets. Compared to traditional LSTM and other baseline models, it offers higher prediction accuracy and stability. This method not only improves the prediction accuracy of PV power but also provides effective technical support for intelligent scheduling and optimization management of PV power plants in China."

Although inverter thermal behavior can be studied through various approaches, such as internal circuit analysis, semiconductor switch modeling, and thermal network development, in commercial contexts it is not feasible to consider the internal details of each inverter, as each model may have distinct components and technologies. Given this limitation, this study proposes to evaluate the thermal performance of commercial PV inverters using two factors derived from mathematical models: thermal capacity (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$F_{\\text {cap }}$</tex>) and thermal dissipation (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$F_{\\mathbf{d}}$</tex>), analyzing their potential as indicators of the thermal quality of the devices. To validate these models, four commercial inverters were tested, divided into two groups according to their nominal power. The results demonstrated that these factors have potential as indicators for evaluating the thermal performance of PV inverters."

In a dynamic mobile environment, where user attention is divided, a key challenge is to reduce the cognitive load of such generate-edit cycle. To address the challenge, we propose a \"macro-to-micro\" control approach to balance user agency and automation in the AI-assisted writing process. This approach offers distinct interaction methods for macro-level adjustments (e.g., tone) and micro-level modifications (e.g., words). We conducted two user studies to evaluate its effectiveness in mobile text editing. Our preliminary results show that our approach significantly reduces cognitive load in demanding mobile situations. We identified a \"control paradox\": users felt more confident and preferred our approach, despite perceiving less direct operational control. Furthermore, our second study identified an important modality mismatch: the voice-centric modality for the micro-editing layer was a significant bottleneck. This finding suggests a key design principle for future systems: effective control is not about more or less, but about matching the interaction modality to the task’s required precision."

This paper proposes an interpretable XGBoost-SHAP data mining framework to analyze the influence of environmental factors on DGA monitoring data. After an initial full-feature model confirmed the dominant role of companion gases, a refined model excluding these interferences was constructed to isolate environmental effects. XGBoost captures complex non-linearities and interactions between environmental factors and DGA readings, while SHAP interprets the model, quantifying each factor's direct impact. Analysis of long-term data from four Photoacoustic Spectroscopy (PAS)-based online DGA monitors reveals Ambient Temperature and Humidity as critical, non-linearly influencing environmental drivers. Notably, humidity and atmospheric pressure impacts suggest intrinsic environmental sensitivity of the PAS devices. Atmospheric Pressure and Seasonality also show considerable influence; Environmental Noise has a negligible effect. This study offers crucial insights for improving online DGA data accuracy and reliability."

The research investigates the microstructural and performance implications of adding TiC and Cr to Ni60 alloy coatings deposited on Q235 steel substrates. Coatings were formulated with varying concentrations of TiC at 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30% by mass and Cr at 5%, 10%, and 15%, to create composite layers with tailored properties. The results indicate that TiC significantly enhances the hardness and wear resistance of the coatings, with optimal performance observed at a 30% TiC content. Additionally, adding 15% Cr improves the coatings’ corrosion resistance. While Cr had a limited effect on reducing friction and wear loss, the presence of TiC created a hard-phase reinforcement within the alloy matrix, contributing to overall structural integrity. The alloy coatings exhibit a promising combination of high hardness and corrosion resistance, making them suitable for soil-engaging applications. This study provides valuable insights into the microstructural modifications achievable through laser cladding and highlights the potential of Ni60-based coatings as durable protective layers for addressing wear and corrosion challenges in agricultural machinery."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are common neurological disorders that progressively affect memory, movement, and daily functioning. Early diagnosis is difficult because symptoms often overlap with normal aging and other conditions. This study focuses on using brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) combined with convolutional neural networks (CNN), a type of pattern recognition technique, to improve early detection of these diseases. MRI scans from patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and healthy individuals were collected and analyzed. The CNN model was trained to identify subtle changes in brain regions linked to these disorders, such as the hippocampus and substantia nigra. Results showed that this approach outperformed traditional clinical methods by detecting early-stage disease markers with higher accuracy and consistency. Compared to manual diagnosis, the CNN method reduces human error and speeds up the diagnostic process by automatically highlighting affected areas. This technique also helps differentiate between Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, which can have similar symptoms but require different treatments. This research suggests that combining MRI with advanced image analysis provides a promising tool to support doctors in early, reliable diagnosis, enabling timely intervention and better management of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases."

Existing fake news detection models have focused significantly on binary classification and have struggled with noisy and long articles. To overcome these challenges, this research proposed a Multimodal Hybrid Summarization Framework (MHSF) to detect fake news in low-resource languages. Initially, multilingual text articles and associated images were obtained from the TALLIP dataset and from other multimodal sources. Subsequently, the collected text is pre-processed and condensed by utilizing a hybrid summarization strategy that integrates mT5-based abstractive and YAKE-based extractive to generate concise yet informative summaries. These summaries are then encoded with multilingual Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (mBERT) for contextual embeddings, whereas images are handled with a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to measure image-to-text consistency and extract visual features. Finally, multimodal embeddings were merged and fed into a fully connected neural network, which was trained with categorical cross-entropy for multiclass classification. The proposed MHSF achieved superior results in terms of accuracy (90.21), precision (90.16), recall (89.72), and F1-Score (90.07) compared to the existing Multilingual Fake News Detection (MFND) approach."

RBFNN (Radial Basis Function Neural Network) has been used for MPPT tracking to track a maximum power point with variations in irradiation. Simulation findings based on MATLAB indicate the efficient functioning of PV employing recommended control approaches in grid-connected mode with low reactive power regulation. This proposed work has a THD Value of 2.96% when the controllers are compared and the efficiency obtained using Zeta converter is 92.4%."

    "abstract": "The intermittency of renewable sources, such as wind energy, poses challenges to their integration into green hydrogen production. Power converters play a key role in regulating these fluctuations. This work presents the design of a gallium nitride (GaN)-based interleaved buck microconverter for a lab-scale wind turbine operating in a wind tunnel. The design of the converter was based on experimental data from the wind tunnel and is suitable for a broad operating range, considering two reference electrolysers of different rated power levels. A PI controller is implemented in simulation to stabilize the output voltage during wind speed variations. Computational results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed GaN-based solution over the operating range, making the converter appropriate for lab-scale studies on the integration of wind power into hydrogen production."

    "abstract": "Data centers are facing an increasing demand for computational resources, especially due to the boom of AI/ML applications. High power electronics generate extreme heat fluxes that need to be dissipated, and advanced thermal management systems (TMS) are needed to maximize efficiency, to improve environmental friendliness (e.g., lower water consumption), and to reduce costs compared to traditional air-cooling systems. The reliability of traditional air-cooling systems is well known as a result of their wide adoption in industry. However, more advanced TMSs for data centers are less characterized, which presents an opportunity to study their reliability. In this work, an oscillating heat pipe (OHP) component and a data center rack TMS are implemented in a reducedorder nodal framework. This nodal framework, previously used for decision-making and exploring design spaces, uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to represent causal relationships between model variables. Using a state-space representation, systems are transitioned through time, and degradation modes are applied stochastically based on user-defined probability density functions (PDFs). A basic OHP oscillator model with simple degradation modes is used to highlight the primary functional capabilities of the reliability framework. Subsequently, the implementation of a data center TMS consisting of OHPs for each CPU and a water-cooling loop (pump, heat exchanger, and cold plate) highlights the flexibility of the platform for larger or more complex systems. Thirty-year studies are simulated for the data center TMS with representative degradation severities and frequencies, and system uptime availability is computed. To explore the effects of degradation and system configuration on uptime availability, a series of parametric sensitivity studies are simulated while varying degradation frequency and component redundancy. Finally, an additional reliability metric, real-time compute capacity, is introduced, and its relevance is explained for data center TMSs that have component failures only applied to one or a few CPUs."

This paper examines how the use of dynamic auditory feedback in virtual reality (VR) can induce a sense of touching a material surface. We designed an interactive system with a 3D-printed PLA (polylactic acid) board, load cells, contact microphones, and three software algorithms that dynamically trigger auditory feedback upon users touching the PLA board. The system simulates four selected material surfaces, such as clay, by providing real-time auditory feedback made with pre-recorded audio of scratching the materials. A user study investigates the system’s effectiveness in enhancing the authenticity of material interaction in VR. The results demonstrate that dynamic auditory feedback significantly improves material perception in VR. Our research presents empirical evidence of sound as a substantial modality for multi-sensory interaction in VR, and we introduce a low-cost, scalable system for simulating material sensation."

The versatility of edible berries is evident across industries such as jam, yogurt, beverage and bakery products with their application varying based on the type of berries. Hence, the classification of edible berries is a crucial task in the organic agri-food industries, demanding accurate and efficient techniques to distinguish between different types. The research explores a comparative analysis of classification of five different types of edible berries, namely tayberry, wineberry, blackberry, blueberry and white mulberry, through conventional machine learning classifiers. Data pre-processing was followed by feature extraction using pre-trained CNN models such as VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3. The concatenated feature vectors were then used to train five machine learning classifiers, whose performances were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Among the classifiers, SVM achieved the highest accuracy and consistently outperformed other models in precision, recall, and F1-score, making it the most reliable for edible berry classification."

The IEC 62109-1 and IEC 62109-2 standards establish criteria for testing under cooling system failures; however, experimental studies validating the effectiveness of thermal protection mechanisms remain limited. This study compiles relevant normative guidelines and presents experimental tests on a single PV inverter subjected to forced cooling failures. A dedicated test setup was developed, incorporating sensors for continuous monitoring of temperature and electrical parameters. This configuration enabled the assessment of the inverter's thermal behavior, the activation of protection systems, and its ability to limit temperature rise. Complete deactivation of the cooling fans resulted in a power derating exceeding 50 %, indicating an active thermal protection response. Similarly, the heatsink blanketing test induced power reduction, confirming the proper functionality of the protection mechanisms. The results provide insights for evaluating current standards and support the reassessment of criteria used in the certification of PV inverters."

The differences in the zero-sequence current effective values calculated by the root mean square algorithm and the half-cycle integration algorithm are compared. The results show that using the half-cycle integration algorithm to calculate the zero-sequence current effective value can effectively reduce the risk of zero-sequence current protection alarms caused by intermittent discharge faults."

However, the multi-parallel switching branches along with a great number of inductors and capacitors elevate the modeling complexity due to the increase in the system's order and the number of stages. To overcome this challenge, data-driven control techniques, capable of designing nonlinear controllers directly from input-output data without a mathematical model, come as an indirect approach of the problem. In addition, maintaining robust operation under faults is critical, requiring fast fault detection with an adaptive system. This work proposes a control approach based on datadriven methods, integrated with a fault-tolerant PWM strategy. The methodology is implemented and experimentally validated in a simulation of a six arms interleaved DC-DC converter, demonstrating effective performance under fault scenarios."

Thresholding methods such as Otsu and Yen offer efficient separation of water and non-water pixels without ground truth or training data. This study evaluates their performance on Sentinel-1 imagery after radiometric calibration, speckle filtering, and geometric correction. A reference water mask derived from Sentinel-2 NDWI is used to assess the accuracy of the thresholding methods via Intersection over Union (IoU). Results show that Yen thresholding is effective under low water body conditions with skewed histogram distributions and also performs reliably in bimodal cases. Otsu achieves better performance in bimodal distributions but is less consistent when water extent is limited. Based on its superior performance, Yen thresholding method on VV polarization is selected for operational use. The key finding is that a method's efficacy depends directly on the backscatter distribution, which is influenced by the water proportion in an area. Overall, the study highlights the potential of thresholding-based methods as rapid and practical solutions for flood response."

Traditional cryptographic methods typically rely on heavy computation and operation by a central authority, which is not feasible in resource-constrained situations. Existing methods involve the use of multifactor schemes with mixed cascaded cryptographic primitives that are complex and carry high communication overhead, which may also compromise user privacy. This work proposes a Lightweight Authentication and Cryptography with Multi-Factor Authentication (LAC-MFA) framework, which evaluate on IoT dataset with healthcare sensor readings, environmental value monitoring, and logs of activity from devices. The Preprocessing steps included normalizing the data and removing noise to create a standardized, refined dataset that would be ready for analysis. Feature extraction is performed using statistical descriptors of normal traffic patterns and relevant contextual attributes to create compact authentication vectors. Finally, the LAC-MFA scheme performs two-factor authentication at gateway, produces dynamic session keys using lightweight hashes, and protects IoT data with Ascon AEAD encryption that provides confidentiality, integrity, and low computational overhead. The experimental results demonstrate that LAC-MFA achieves higher accuracy (98.77 %), precision (97.55 %), recall (98.45 %), and F1-score (98.76 %) than the existing model Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)."

Firstly, the original signal is converted into a two-dimensional image through feature extraction using CWT, which can capture the high-frequency, lowfrequency, and temporal features of the signal simultaneously. Secondly, the generated two-dimensional image is concatenated with AA after passing through the first convolution layer of the residual network. AA processes the CWT image in both dimensions, preserving the long-range dependencies of the CWT image in the time and frequency dimensions, and avoiding the problem of limited receptive field of the local window in CNN. Finally, multiple residual blocks are used to further extract the deep features of the image, and the bearing faults are diagnosed by combining with the fully connected layer. The experimental results show that the CWT-AA-ResNet has high diagnostic accuracy and good generalization performance. The fault diagnosis accuracy rate can reach over 99% on the Case Western Reserve University dataset."

    "abstract": "This research project investigates virtual blue spaces and their potential to positively affect human health. Blue spaces are defined as water-based outdoor environments, in this instance the focus is on natural water surface bodies, such as lakes, rivers, waterfalls, and the sea. Recent research has shown that activities in blue spaces can boost human wellbeing [1]. This project highlights art-based Mixed Reality (MR) spaces that mimic blue space environments or are inspired by them, and their potential to promote public health. These virtual blue spaces consist of a large-scale 270-degrees screen projection to create a virtual environment backdrop and digital elements that are displayed through an MR headset on pass-through mode to create an immersive environment and offer interactivity to users. User engagement is driven through exploration of the environment, narrative, and dance exercise. Further enhancement is achieved through spatial audio consisting of nature sounds and music. The project includes a series of user experience testing with a focus on emotional response/wellbeing, immersion, as well as embodiment/presence and risks of cybersickness."

The input current is obtained through digital integration of the voltage across the inductors of a three-phase dual interleaved boost converter operating in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), a topology that enables a power factor close to unity without dedicated sensors. The estimated current is used to compute the instantaneous power, which feeds an MPPT algorithm based on the Perturb and Observe (P&O) method. Experimental validation was carried out using a 2 kW wind turbine emulator and a three-phase AC source under different load conditions. Experimental validation with a 2 kW FT-2000 turbine emulator and a three-phase AC source confirmed unity-close power factor and accurate sensorless current estimation, with input-power errors <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\leq 2.0 \\%$</tex> relative to a Fluke Norma 4000.

    "abstract": "The plant-wide broadcasting system in nuclear power plants plays a vital role in daily operations and emergency management, serving as an indispensable communication tool for issuing alerts, notifying personnel, and directing evacuations. However, the extensive distribution of loudspeakers across complex environments has long posed challenges for manual inspections, often leading to delayed fault detection that compromises information delivery and creates safety risks. Systematic speaker failures remain a key barrier to effective broadcast communication. The core objective of this research is to develop automated monitoring systems for loudspeaker operations, enabling timely identification of malfunctioning units. This ensures reliable and accurate message transmission to target audiences during routine operations, major maintenance, and emergency evacuation scenarios. This research integrates nuclear power industry information technology with acoustic monitoring expertise, leveraging rapidly evolving wireless communication technologies and the digital transformation trends in the sector. We propose an IoT and AI-based Speaker status monitoring system that constructs a distributed data collection network, designs standardized test sound sources, and employs advanced sound event detection, voiceprint similarity calculation, and Automatic Speech Recognitions to automatically assess speaker performance. The system evaluates operational status through comprehensive algorithm scoring. Analysis from wireless communication, safety redundancy, and algorithm robustness perspectives demonstrates its feasibility and effectiveness in real plant environments. Key innovations include: developing adaptive monitoring modules for high-noise, high-radiation conditions in nuclear plants; enhancing fault detection accuracy through multimodel fusion; and exploring predictive maintenance extensions via digital twin and edge computing concepts. This study not only provides engineering foundations for intelligent monitoring of nuclear power plant broadcast systems but also offers valuable references for health management of industrial acoustic equipment."

However, these models must possess extensive domain-specific knowledge and understanding of unique medical terminology. Despite recent advancements, current general-purpose and biomedical LLMs often fall short in capturing the critical nuances and contextual intricacies unique to neonatal care. This paper presents a comprehensive fine-tuning approach for adapting PubMedBERT specifically for neonatal care applications using structured and unstructured data from 57 international sources across six clinical categories. Our novel three-stage fine-tuning methodology transforms PubMedBERT into a neonatal specialist through progressive specialization: general adaptation, category-specific training, and knowledge integration. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that our fine-tuned model achieves 85.4 % clinical accuracy across six neonatal NLP tasks—a 22.6 % improvement over baseline PubMedBERT, while requiring only 18 GPU hours on a single NVIDIA A100. Analysis shows our 110M parameter model approaches the performance of models 1,000-5,000 times larger while requiring just 0.01% of their computational resources. This resource-efficient approach democratizes access to specialized medical AI, making advanced capabilities accessible to clinical environments with limited computational infrastructure."

In response to the issues of high model order and poor accuracy in preserving oscillation modes in this study, this paper proposes a dominant oscillation broadband oscillation singular perturbation reduction method based on participation degree singular values. Firstly, by analyzing the broadband oscillation modes and their damping characteristics of the full order small signal model, the extremely weak damping mode is determined as the reserved target; Then, by combining the contribution of the participating factors with the weight of Hankel singular values, the fast and slow state variables are divided; Finally, construct a reduced order small signal model in singular perturbation form. The results indicate that this method ensures a high degree of consistency in the dynamic characteristics of the system before and after order reduction, while ignoring the dynamic process of fast state variables and retaining the dominant broadband oscillation mode; The reduced order small signal model has the ability to analyze broadband oscillations that is highly consistent with the full order small signal model and electromagnetic transient model, and is suitable for the research of broadband oscillations in the grid connected system of matched grid type direct drive wind farms."

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL)-based automated cybersickness detection methods, along with adaptive mitigation techniques, can enhance user comfort and interaction. However, recent studies show that these DL-based systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks; small perturbations to sensor inputs can degrade model performance, trigger incorrect mitigation, and disrupt the user’s immersive experience (UIX). Additionally, there is a lack of dedicated open-source testbeds that evaluate the robustness of these systems under adversarial conditions, limiting the ability to assess their real-world effectiveness. To address this gap, this paper introduces Adversarial-VR, a novel real-time VR testbed for evaluating DL-based cybersickness detection and mitigation strategies under adversarial conditions. Developed in Unity, the testbed integrates two state-of-the-art (SOTA) DL models: DeepTCN and Transformer, which are trained on the open-source MazeSick dataset, for real-time cybersickness severity detection and applies a dynamic visual tunneling mechanism that adjusts the field-of-view based on model outputs. To assess robustness, we incorporate three SOTA adversarial attacks: MI-FGSM, PGD, and C&W, which successfully prevent cybersickness mitigation by fooling DL-based cybersickness models’ outcomes. We implement these attacks using a testbed with a custom-built VR Maze simulation and an HTC Vive Pro Eye headset, and we open-source our implementation for widespread adoption by VR developers and researchers. Results show that these adversarial attacks are capable of successfully fooling the system. For instance, the C&W attack results in a 5.94× decrease in accuracy for the Transformer-based cybersickness model compared to the accuracy without the attack."

    "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) systems are increasingly integrating foundation models, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to provide more context-aware and adaptive user experiences. This integration has led to the development of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in real-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate tasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require understanding and leveraging user’s long-term experiences and preferences. This limitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over historical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these challenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents that can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to user-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four interconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing, (2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3) Spatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and (4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an implementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target application and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our framework across diverse domains. We aim for this work to motivate future research toward developing more intelligent AR systems that can effectively bridge user’s interaction history with adaptive, context-aware task assistance."

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised subspace clustering has achieved promising results in hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis by leveraging spectral structure with limited labels. However, most existing methods suffer from two key limitations. First, they separate feature learning and clustering, preventing joint optimization. Second, they rely on explicit self-representation matrices with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{2}\\right)$</tex> complexity, leading to significant memory and computation overhead. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end semi-supervised deep subspace clustering framework tailored for HSI data. It unifies representation learning and clustering into a single trainable architecture, preserving contextual and subspace structures without computing large affinity matrices. The framework integrates cross-entropy loss, supervised contrastive learning, label-guided subspace modeling, and pseudo-label-based consistency regularization, enabling effective use of scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Experiments on standard HSI datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing unsupervised and semi-supervised clustering approaches under low-label regimes, illustrating the practical potential of semi-supervised deep subspace clustering for real-world HSI interpretation."

    "abstract": "Phase change materials (PCMs) are used to passively cool transient electromechanical systems by absorbing (releasing) heat over a narrow temperature range during the phase transition. Paraffins and salt hydrates, having large gravimetric and volumetric latent heats of fusion, are particularly well-suited for applications like heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) that demand efficient thermal management. However, even with large thermal capacitances, these materials are not commonly implemented at the system level due in part to their low gravimetric and volumetric power densities. One method to increase the rates of thermal energy charging (discharging) of these low thermal conductivity materials is to create a composite system, such as a thermally conductive porous network infiltrated with PCM. In this work, we report a comparative investigation of the heat transfer rates of a 3.50 mm thick paraffin-expanded graphite (EG) and salt hydrate eutectic-EG composite slab in a cold plate heat exchanger over 100 cycles. A custom flow loop setup is used to characterize the rate of heat transfer between the working fluid and PCM-EG composite slabs. Transient heat transfer is characterized for each material at temperatures $5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and $10^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ above their melting points. This study demonstrates the improved thermal performance and system-level efficiency of PCM-EG composites, as well as their stability over hundreds of cycles. We observe similar thermal charge and discharge times for both PCM-EG composites, indicating that the heat storage rates are governed primarily by the conductive EG matrix and not the thermal conductivity of the PCM itself. Finally, we present the first reported heat absorption rate for a salt hydrate eutectic composite slab."

It is frequently difficult for conventional rule-based and signature-driven Data Loss Prevention (DLP) systems to identify intricate and changing leakage patterns. A thorough analysis of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methods for successfully preventing sensitive data leaks is presented in this review paper, with an emphasis on Deep Learning (DL) and optimization models. DL techniques, such as transformer-based models, autoencoders, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), provide strong capabilities for identifying anomalous behaviour and unauthorized data exposure by recognizing intricate patterns in unstructured and semi-structured data. To improve detection accuracy, optimize feature selection and fine-tune model parameters, metaheuristic optimization methods including Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Dingo Optimization Algorithm (DOA) and Firefly Optimization Algorithm (FOA) are used concurrently. Leakage prevention frameworks that handle high-dimensional, heterogeneous data streams are now scalable and adaptive owing to the incorporation of various AI paradigms. Important issues including data privacy, adversarial attacks, interpretability, and regulatory compliance are also covered in this assessment. In order to create safe, intelligent, and privacy-preserving data environments, it concludes by outlining new developments and research prospects, such as federated learning, explainable AI, and lightweight AI models for edge-based DLP systems."

Using ground truth labels and common pre-processing and augmentation methods, the model is trained and assessed on slices from the BraTS 2020 dataset. Remarkably, the model achieved an SSIM score of 0.95, PSNR value of 32.6, MAE value of 0.02 and LPIPS with a value of 0.14, demonstrating strong performance on synthesis.

    "abstract": "The conventional English language assessments face significant and complex challeneges in providing the personalized learning experience due to non-adaptability nature of the individuals to learn its proficiency levels, learning patterns and cognitive preferences. To overcome this afforemntioned challenge, the paper presents the novel intelligent English test questions resource recommendation system that leverages hybrid deep learning techniques to deliver adaptive, individualized assessment experiences. The proposed multi-modal framework consists of Bi-GRU networks for capturing the short sequences of data patterns, Transformer based language model(BERT) for automatically assessing the question complexity including vocabulary, syntax and semantic related words. Finally the deep feed forward networks are proposed to classify the personalized student's ability forms. Experimental validation was conducted using a comprehensive dataset of 450,000 English language learner interactions across 10,000 test questions, encompassing proficiency levels from beginner (A1) to advanced (A3) according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). Results demonstrate substantial improvements over conventional adaptive testing systems: 97.7% accuracy in difficulty level prediction, 96.3% precision in question-learner matching, and 87.6% learner satisfaction scores. The suggested research contributes to the advancement of intelligent learning systems and provides a scalable recommendation framework for personalized English language learning assessment that can be extended to other language learning domains."

This method can be used to establish a network between large-scale UAV clusters and ground base stations, greatly reducing the workload of preplanning and initialization. In the communication model, the simultaneous transmission of multiple high-quality real-time images by inspection drones can cause network congestion, thereby affecting the imaging quality of the monitoring model. In severe cases, it can even cause distortion of the monitoring image, making it impossible for the inspection team to work normally. This paper adopts a refined automatic transmission line inspection model, which can compress the collected image data according to the current work requirements, thereby realizing multi-channel transmission of inspection data within a limited transmission bandwidth.

Among various deep learning approaches, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in learning complex data distributions and generating high-quality images. This paper presents a comprehensive review of GAN-based super-resolution methods applied to MRI.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework that integrates VLMs with end-to-end trainable motion planning. Our approach consists of: A high-level VLM-based policy that translates language instructions into semantic sub-goals, enhanced by cross modal attention alignment. A low-level RL controller (PPO-based) that generates executable trajectories while receiving hierarchical rewards. Key innovations include gradient propagation across layers and dense reward shaping to mitigate sparse reward issues. Experiments on the ALFRED benchmark show a 15.7% improvement in task completion rate compared to flat RL baselines, with 23% shorter path lengths in complex languageguided scenarios. Ablation studies validate the necessity of both hierarchical structure and VLM integration."

While hybrid energy storage system (HESS) combining batteries (BTs) and supercapacitors (SCs) offer a potential solution, their performance and aging behavior under dynamic loads remain inadequately addressed. This paper proposes a novel electro-thermal-aging coupled HESS model to accurately characterize system dynamics and aging effects under pulsed power load (PPL) conditions. Three control strategies— PID control, fuzzy logic control (FLC), and coordinated control (CC)—are designed and evaluated for system performance and aging mitigation.Simulation results demonstrate that the model effectively captures aging characteristics, with BT capacity decreasing from 2.5 Ah to 1.97 Ah and SC capacitance decaying from 198 F to 165 F. coordinated control achieves optimal system regulation with a settling time of 3.4 s and zero steady-state error, while fuzzy logic control mitigates BT aging, limiting capacity degradation to 0.0781 Ah. Coordinated control also minimizes SC capacitance degradation to 12.5921 F, outperforming other strategies. This study provides valuable insights for optimizing energy management and control of HESS, laying a foundation for future hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) validation and practical implementation."

    "abstract": "Lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) are essential tools for the swift detection of clinically significant biomarkers, playing a vital role in point-of-care diagnostics. However, their effectiveness is often compromised due to the improper orientation of immobilized antibodies on nitrocellulose membranes, leading to diminished colorimetric signals. Enhancing the performance of LFIAs hinges on achieving precise antibody orientation, as correctly aligned antibodies exhibit superior antigen-binding capabilities compared to their randomly oriented counterparts. To address this issue, we employed borophene nanosheets—a two-dimensional nanomaterial—and functionalized them with antibodies using a photoinduced immobilization technique (PIT) to ensure optimal orientation. This method involves utilizing UV light to selectively break antibody disulfide bonds, revealing thiol groups that form stable covalent boron-sulfur bonds with the borophene surface. The resultant densely packed antibody layer maintains antigen-binding activity and enhances target interaction. We tested the effectiveness of this approach by applying antibody-coated borophene nanosheets onto a nitrocellulose membrane, creating a portable lateral flow assay aimed at detecting HMGB-1—a potential biomarker for endometriosis—in menstrual effluent. The assay delivered results in under 10 minutes and achieved a detection threshold of 40 pg/mL, markedly improving upon the sensitivity of traditional LFIAs. Specificity tests confirmed no cross-reactivity with common blood proteins such as albumin, fibrinogen, and gamma globulin, underscoring the assay's reliability and clinical relevance. This testing platform can also be adapted to identify other analytes, indicating its potential applicability across various women's health-related conditions that currently lack adequate diagnostic tools."

    "abstract": "With the deepening of Industry 4.0 and the rapid development of intelligent manufacturing, Automatic Guided Vehicle (AGV) systems are becoming increasingly common in warehousing and logistics. However, most existing AGV scheduling algorithms are limited to optimizing single point transportation paths and are difficult to adapt to dynamic warehouse environments, often leading to congestion during peak hours and reducing overall system efficiency. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a three-stage dynamic path planning algorithm for adaptive AGV scheduling optimization. During the system startup phase, a priority based queuing algorithm is adopted to effectively prevent congestion at key nodes such as warehouse entrances and sorting areas. During the system operation phase, an open path algorithm was designed to guide AGVs to prioritize selecting routes with wider roads, reducing the risk of congestion in narrow passages. During idle or low traffic periods, applying temporary parking algorithms enables AGVs to automatically calculate and park in the least likely locations to cause congestion, thereby improving resource utilization. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional A * algorithm, the proposed three-stage dynamic path planning algorithm achieves average transportation time, reduces congestion rate, and improves overall system throughput in a dynamic warehouse environment. This study provides an innovative solution for AGV scheduling in intelligent warehousing logistics, which has significant practical value."

The battery module considered consist of a matrix of cylindrical Li-ion cells sitting on four TGPs (also referred to as 2D flat heat pipe) for bottom-cooling. Heat is removed from the TGPs by coupling its extremity with a heat sink (air cooled) or a cold plate (liquid cooled). The battery module of 1.3 kWh is experimentally cycled with 0.7 C charge rate, 1 C and 2 C discharge rate in a CC-CV protocol. The thermal performances of the two heat-dissipation configurations are evaluated based on cell averaged temperatures, in-cell temperature differences and in-module temperature differences. The two systems showed comparable performances regarding the maximum cell averaged temperature. During the 2 C discharges, the maximum cell-averaged temperatures are $50^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and $54^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ for air cooling and liquid cooling respectively, while the maximum in-module temperature difference are $8^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and $10^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ respectively. These maximums all happen at the end of the CC phase of the cycling. This experimental work concludes that fast charging and high-power operation can be sustained with the use of TGPs. Also, given the comparable performances of the two heat dissipation configurations and the ease of implementation of air cooling, thermal ground planes can make air cooling a viable option in commercial electrical vehicle batteries."

    "abstract": "Solder joints in electronic packages are prone to fatigue failures due to mismatches in the thermal expansion coefficients during fluctuating temperature environments. In our previous works in ITherm 2022 and ITherm 2023, we showed that total energy dissipation that had occurred in the solder ($W=$ sum of $\\Delta \\mathrm{W}$ for all cycles) could be used as a governing degradation parameter, which is independent of the damage level applied during each cycle. Then, we identified a scalar damage parameter, $\\mathrm{D}=\\mathrm{D}(\\mathrm{W})=0 \\leq \\mathrm{D} \\leq 1$ using damage mechanics approach. This scalar damage parameter, D, can be used to accurately predict the observed material property degradations occurring during cyclic loading. The Anand viscoplastic constitutive model is often used to model solders as a part of FEA based reliability predictions for electronic packages. In our previous studies, we investigated the evolution of the Anand constitutive model in relation to thermal aging. However, the impact of mechanical cycling on the evolution of Anand model parameters has remained unexplored. Thus, understanding how cyclic damage influences the Anand parameters is crucial for accurately predicting the long-term reliability of solder joints, especially in environments where both thermal and mechanical stresses are present. In this study, we investigated the evolution of Anand model parameters as a function of the damage parameter, D. Four damage levels were considered ($\\mathrm{D}=0.00,0.10,0.15$, and 0.20). Small uniaxial cylindrical samples of SAC305 solder were prepared by melting alloys, followed by a reflow solidification technique to attain joint-like microstructures. The samples were then subjected to mechanical cycling corresponding to each damage level. To assess the material’s response of the damaged specimens, uniaxial tensile tests were conducted across a range of strain rates $\\left(\\dot{\\varepsilon}=0.001,0.0001\\right.$, and $\\left.0.00001 \\mathrm{sec}^{-1}\\right)$, and temperatures ($25,50,75,100$, and $125^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$). For each level of damage parameter D, a comprehensive test matrix of 15 combinations of strain rates and temperatures was developed, and tensile tests were performed on 10 samples per combination. The variations in Anand model parameters with damage due to mechanical cycling were characterized, and empirical relationships were established to model these changes. This study provides key insights into how mechanical damage affects the evolution of Anand parameters and contributes to more accurate constitutive modeling of solder materials."

Recent advances in augmented reality (AR) have demonstrated that visual cueing can effectively modify gait parameters in PD patients, with AR cues proving as effective as real-world cues for improving step length, gait speed, and crossing maneuvers. However, existing AR cueing systems, including applications like Holocue, rely primarily on static, pre-positioned cues or continuous cueing paradigms that require patients to adapt to predetermined patterns, poten- tially limiting patient autonomy and confidence in independent navigation. This paper presents a novel adaptive AR pathfinding system that integrates established visual cueing principles with user-directed navigation to enhance both therapeutic effectiveness and patient autonomy."

The most cost-effective approach for this communication is utilizing the series-connected power line. However, switching noise generated by the converter modules significantly disrupts the communication channel, posing challenges to achieving reliable transmission. This paper proposes a Power Line Communication (PLC) design method specifically tailored for converter modules operating in noisy environments. In each module, a Differential Balanced Bridge (DBB) structure is implemented to suppress noise, thereby enhancing the Signal-to Noise Ratio (SNR) of the PLC and enabling fast, low-latency communication. A system channel model is developed to analyze the transmission gains of both noise and signal, facilitating a comprehensive SNR evaluation. Finally, a prototype system consisting of eight H-bridge converter modules is constructed to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Existing wireless video transmission schemes directly conduct video coding in pixel level, while neglecting the inner semantics contained in videos. In this paper, we propose a wireless video semantic communication framework with decoupled diffusion multi-frame compensation (DDMFC), abbreviated as WVSC-D, which integrates the idea of semantic communication into wireless video transmission scenarios. WVSC-D first encodes original video frames as semantic frames and then conducts video coding based on such compact representations, enabling the video coding in semantic level rather than pixel level. Moreover, to further reduce the communication overhead, a reference semantic frame is introduced to substitute motion vectors of each frame in common video coding methods. At the receiver, DDMFC is proposed to generate compensated current semantic frame by a two-stage conditional diffusion process. With both the reference frame transmission and DDMFC frame compensation, the bandwidth efficiency improves with satisfying video transmission performance. Experimental results verify the performance gain of WVSC-D over other DL-based methods e.g. DVSC about 1.8 dB in terms of PSNR."

    "abstract": "Corrosion is a leading cause of pipeline failures, responsible for up to a third of reported incidents. Given the extensive length and limited accessibility of pipelines, operators rely on frequent in-line inspections (ILIs) to detect and quantify corrosion defects. Feature matching between successive ILIs is therefore utilized to align and compare this data, enabling the identification of corrosion evolution and behavior. However, measurement uncertainties, nonuniform corrosion growth, and spatial interactions between adjacent defects pose significant challenges in achieving accurate matching. This study proposes a two-phase feature matching model designed to address these limitations. The first phase performs Iterative Closest Point (ICP) alignment with a context-aware nearest neighbor selection strategy based on Directional Epsilon Neighborhood Clustering (DENC) to isolate stable feature pairs and minimize ambiguous associations in densely clustered defect regions. The second phase applies a novel proximity–overlap-informed correspondence optimization using linear programming to identify matches and outliers by jointly considering feature positioning and geometric attributes. The model’s effectiveness is evaluated on a 1116 m subsea pipeline segment involving two consecutive inspections reporting 1305 and 1491 features, respectively. Compared to three state-of-the-art models, the proposed approach achieves a recall, precision, and F1 score of 99.2%, demonstrating substantial improvements in accuracy, stability, and robustness to inspection and corrosion-related uncertainties. These results confirm the model’s ability to address critical limitations in existing approaches and underscore its potential to enhance pipeline integrity assessments."

Their inherent vulnerabilities, such as insecure real-time protocols and endpoint-only protection mechanisms, result in traditional general-purpose network security solutions providing only partial safeguarding of data and traffic. To mitigate these weaknesses, a four-engine architecture featuring a self-adaptive PCA selector for automated feature filtering is first proposed. Subsequently, the novel Transformer model enhanced by Scaled-CNN and Bi-LSTM hybrid networks (Trans+scaled-CNN&bi-LSTM) is proposed, which combines spatial feature extraction by the Scaled-CNN, temporal pattern learning by Bi-LSTM, and dynamic weight optimization by Transformer for intrusion detection.

The proposed methodology aims to boost any base classifier via optimization, interval-based feature selection, and intelligent binary decomposition. By restructuring a multiclass task into hierarchies of binary subproblems and linking each boundary to automatically selected statistical features, the developed method improves diagnostic accuracy and generalization. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate improved performance compared to existing methods, achieving a high accuracy rate. Although the approach increases the computation time, the notable improvements in accuracy make the balance between precision and computation time advantageous for real-world use."

    "abstract": "Weak signals often correspond to targets of interest in high-dynamic target detection scenarios. Low-loss extraction and accurate localization of these weak signals are critical for subsequent signal processing. In multi-source, multi-domain overlapping scenarios with a high dynamic range, precise extraction requires highly accurate amplitude estimation, as even minor errors in strong-source amplitude estimation can obscure extremely weak targets. However, existing algorithms focus primarily on parameter estimation in the space, time, and frequency domains, while neglecting precise amplitude estimation in the energy domain. This leads to insufficient strong-source cancellation and hinders the effective extraction of extremely weak signals. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a method for low-loss extraction and super-resolution localization of extremely weak signals and all multi-source signals simultaneously in high-dynamic scenarios. The key contributions are as follows: 1) An accurate super-resolution reconstruction and localization algorithm for multi-source signals in overlapping domains. It integrates Bayesian inference and least squares (LS) estimation under multiple measurement vector (MMV) model, achieving signal amplitude estimation performance approaching the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB). A Generalized Beta Mixture (GBM) is employed as a sparse prior to further improve reconstruction accuracy, and fixed-point iteration for parameter updates accelerates convergence. 2) A framework for low-loss extraction and super-resolution localization of extremely weak signals. This framework overcomes the limitations of traditional sparse reconstruction approaches in high-dynamic scenarios. The proposed method exhibits robustness to various signal types, capable of separating, reconstructing, and localizing multi-source signals with diverse form of waveforms and energy distributions, demonstrating strong potential for practical applications."

In response, this study considers the problem of range deception interference (RDI) recognition and high-speed target integration detection in multistatic radar system. Firstly, the target echo model under RDI environment is established based on the range history model. Then, the intra-channel coherent integration of the echoes after pulse compression is realized by Radon Fourier transform (RFT). Next, the entropy circulation matching (ECM) algorithm is proposed to accomplish the multi-channel coherent integration, while obtaining the estimated location values of the target and RDIs in different channels. Further, the location values are processed by elliptic positioning (EP) to realize the recognition of the target and RDIs. Finally, simulation experiments verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, and the effect of factors such as multiple targets scenario, jamming-to-signal ratio and pulse number on the performance of the method are covered."

    "abstract": "In through the wall radar imaging systems, accurate knowledge of wall parameters such as thickness and dielectric constant is essential for producing well-focused images of targets behind walls. In practice, these parameters are often unknown, and using incorrect values during image reconstruction can cause target displacement, blurring, or smearing. Autofocusing is an image formation process with unknown wall parameters that iteratively adjusts parameters based on a focus evaluation function until the image with the optimal focus is achieved. The process typically involves the selection of discretized values from the equal interval ranges of wall thickness and the relative permittivity, forming parameter pairs. For each pair, a radar image is reconstructed and assessed using a focusing metric, with the image corresponding to the optimal metric selected as the final focused result. However, conventional autofocusing methods are computationally intensive due to their exhaustive iterative search, which hinders their real time use. To overcome this, we propose an efficient autofocusing algorithm that applies a criterion to select fewer parameter pairs based on the wall parameter range, thereby reducing the number of iterations and complexity. Experimental validation demonstrates that our method produces high-quality focused images with significantly lower computation time, even when wall parameters are initially unknown."

However, achieving tight packaging for general objects often demands significant labor from human packers, particularly in high-throughput scenes. Compared to existing robot packing approaches, RoboPacker effectively overcomes challenges such as diverse object appearances, severe occlusion, and crowded packing spaces. Specifically, we propose an open-vocabulary shape estimation method to reconstruct complete point clouds for cluttered objects. We also design effective interactions with object clutter to gather informative visual clues for shape estimation under high uncertainty. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework to optimize packing order, location, and orientation for maximum space utilization. The robotic packing system integrates these techniques with feasible manipulation methods for real-world implementation. In this way, RoboPacker achieves efficient packing of novel and irregular objects, which is more suitable for real deployment environments. The Real-world experiments demonstrate RoboPacker can tightly pack 20 densely cluttered everyday objects from 8 seen and 4 novel classes into the 40×40×20 cm shipping box with a 73.3% success rate.

The first one allows to regulate the state of linear switched systems to zero, whereas the second one is designed for switched affine systems proving practical stability of the origin. In both cases, the determination of a guaranteed cost associated with each control strategy is shown. In the cases of linear and affine systems, the existence of the solution for the Lyapunov-Metzler condition is discussed, and guidelines for the selection of a solution ensuring suitable performance of the system evolution are provided. The theoretical results are finally assessed by means of three examples."

    "abstract": "Since social media platforms, such as Facebook, are growing so quickly, digital advertising has become a highly data-driven ecosystem. Optimizing return on investment (ROI) and reducing wasteful advertising spending are two challenges that businesses face. A/B testing and manual adjustments are two examples of traditional campaign management techniques that are frequently reactive and ineffective. This paper investigates the use of predictive models to make proactive, data-driven decisions that maximize Facebook advertising spend. The proposed framework analyzes demographic, behavioral, and psychological data to forecast user engagement and conversion probabilities using machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks. To make sure that resources are focused on the most promising leads, the predictive insights are then used to adjust budget allocations across audience segments. According to a case study, predictive modeling can enhance click-through rates (CTR) and conversion performance while cutting advertising waste by as much as 30%. According to the results, this predictive strategy performs noticeably better than traditional methods, giving businesses a distinct competitive advantage as well as more accurate targeting and improved campaign efficiency. For researchers and marketers looking to use predictive analytics to improve social media advertising strategies, this study provides useful insights."

So, this system is provided as a hybrid system architecture that combines encryption method and data hiding method to improve security. This system embeds special space codes in HTML files by encoding four-pair bits, which provides a string of seven secret bits for each letter in an encrypted secret message. In this system, secret message can easily retrieve and the original HTML file may be successfully rebuilt using this hybrid method, which provides a greater security."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the implementation of a minimalist UEFI x64 bootloader and kernel entirely in FASM assembly. The bootloader loads a simple kernel that displays \"HELLOWORLD\". The implementation is unique in that both the bootloader and kernel executables are created from simple flat binary output of the assembler. The generation of PE32+ and ELF64 executables and the interfaces required to interact with UEFI hardware are implemented from scratch by referring to their ABI specification documents without relying on libraries. This technique eliminates toolchain dependencies, grants full control to the system architect, and facilitates a deeper understanding of internal mechanisms. The work serves as both a foundation for the future development of a modern operating system free from legacy design decisions and an educational resource for understanding the esoteric nature of operating systems development."

Based on the inverse kinematics solution of the mechanical arm and torque calculation theory, a torque model considering the weight of the body, water resistance, load gravity, additional mass and friction force was proposed. On this basis, the traditional PID control system was improved.

Compared to 2D CNNs, 3D CNNs have a larger number of parameters and higher computational complexity. For this reason, researchers have focused on designing efficient 3D CNN architectures and hardware accelerators. The purpose of this survey is to serve as a guide to recent work on 3D CNNs for action recognition with a focus on FPGA-based accelerators and hardware-aware algorithmic optimizations. We provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in 3D CNN architectures as well as the action recognition datasets used for training and testing the architectures. A performance comparison of 2D versus 3D CNNs on two datasets (Sports-1M and UCF101) is included. We explore the designs of FPGA-based accelerators and compare them in terms of achieved throughput, resource utilization and power. We survey current methods of optimization for 3D CNN architectures, which are meant to reduce the number of parameters and the memory requirements and to facilitate their deployment on FPGAs. Finally we highlight current challenges and potential areas of improvement in acceleration of 3D CNNs on FPGA platforms."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in transformer-based text-to-motion generation have significantly improved motion quality. However, achieving both real-time performance and long-horizon scalability remains an open challenge. In this paper, we present Hi-RQCT (Hierarchical Residual-Quantized Causal Transformer), which generates high-quality lifelike 3D human motions by training a single transformer model. Hi-RQCT consists of only two main components: 1) RVQ-VAE, a hierarchical residual vector quantization variational autoencoder, which discretizes continuous motion sequences with high precision; 2) Hierarchical Causal Transformer, responsible for generating the base motion sequences in an autoregressive manner while simultaneously inferring residuals across different layers. Experimental results demonstrate that Hi-RQCT can generate smooth and continuous motion sequences up to 260 frames (13 seconds), surpassing the 196 frames (10 seconds) length limitation of existing datasets like HumanML3D. On the HumanML3D test set, our model achieves the best quantitative performance, and the generated motions also exhibit highly realistic and expressive visual quality in qualitative evaluations."

In this study, a cyber-physical system(CPS) integrated with virtual reality(VR) and a haptic device is developed to digitize human skills in grinding operations, which especially require human insight and intuition in the process. First of all, a mesh generation method is proposed, where a workpiece that needs grinding operation is scanned in the real world and generated into mesh inside the CPS. The generated mesh of the actual workpiece is then combined with the ideal CAD model, where the target surface for grinding is visible and enabled to make contact with the tool inside the CPS. The haptic device was implemented in the simulation as a tool and directly generated force feedback to the operator. Our work can digitize human operations with realistic visual and force feedback, and has the potential to transform human knowledge to robots for autonomous grinding process."

With a primary focus on the KUI language, this study proposes a data-centric method for building SCR systems for low-resource languages. We describe a specialized voice command categorization method for KUI, a low-resource language, to tackle this problem. Researchers from various organizations have conducted extensive research over the past twenty years to test novel approaches and how they may be used in speech processing systems. The voice command dataset has been utilized by several academics who have attempted to improve the effectiveness of speech command-based systems. There haven't been any noteworthy attempts to identify KUI speech. The KUI brief speech commands data set used in this investigation was collected entirely from real-world recordings. This study explores the vital task of command recognition using machine learning techniques. Using raw waveforms as inputs for our models, we transform them into Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) to execute feature engineering. We test several methods, including Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors. The results of the experiments show that the highest performance may be obtained by combining MFCC with augmentation and a Support Vector Machine. The corresponding F1-score, accuracy, precision, and recall are 89.00%, 88.00%, 87.00%, and 89.00%. Furthermore, our investigations provide low-resource spoken language comprehension researchers with critical new perspectives on speech-to-intent categorization. Our approach may be used as a recipe to create personalized speech command datasets, even for languages with limited resources."

Representative models across four categories including end-to-end, semi-modular, retrieval-based, and text-only approaches are systematically evaluated. Experiments are conducted on Flickr8k (clean, small-scale captions), the COCO Karpathy split (standard benchmark), and a reduced VizWiz subset (noisy, real-world captions). Performance is assessed using accuracy metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, SPICE) and efficiency metrics (VRAM usage, latency, throughput). Results reveal clear trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost, highlighting lightweight yet competitive alternatives.

Challenges: Existing Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN)-based teaching systems are constrained by poor adaptability to dynamic classroom environments. Proposed Model: To address these challenges, this research proposes a university course IPE teaching system using the You Only Look Once version-7 model for object detection with Virtual Reality technology (YOLOv7-VR). Initially, student activities in class were directly captured in real-time through classroom video streams. The collected data are then fed into the YOLOv5-based object recognition model, which detects student actions such as head orientation, hand raising, and inattentiveness without relying on the preprocessing step. Subsequently, VR scene rendering for contextual teaching generates immersive socio-political environments to enhance student interaction and situational understanding. Finally, the Rule-based Adaptive Feedback (RAF) module analyzes recognition results and VR interaction logs to provide teachers with real-time insights and guide teaching strategies. Results: experimental results demonstrate that the proposed YOLOv7-VR model achieved a Mean Percentage Error (MPE) ratio of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{8 9. 3 5 \\%}$</tex> and an Evaluation of Student's Ratio (ESR) of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{8 1. 3 4 \\%}$</tex> when compared with the existing RBFNN model."

Additionally, it looks at optimization techniques for self-healing, such as sophisticated mathematical models and algorithms intended to effectively manage loads and restructure networks in the event of a fault. The use of artificial intelligence, namely multi-agent systems and reinforcement learning are being investigated for its capacity to optimize grid operations and manage faults on its own. Furthermore, the incorporation of self-healing mechanisms into microgrids is examined, emphasizing how they might improve the adaptability and resilience of power distribution networks.

Hydropower exhibits fast regulation and flexible output characteristics, enabling complementary operation with PV generation to reduce peak-valley load differences. However, with increasing grid-connected PV capacity, the regulating capability of cascade hydropower (CHP) becomes progressively inadequate. By retrofitting CHP stations with pumped storage (PS) units to form hybrid pumped-storage (HPS) systems, peak shaving and valley filling can be effectively achieved, significantly enhancing the regulating capacity of the CHP stations. However, HPS systems involve complex hydraulic coupling constraints that impact the day-ahead peak-shaving dispatch of PV-HPS power stations. In this paper, a day-ahead peak shaving scheduling model for PV-HPS is proposed. Firstly, the complementary operation of PV-HPS systems is introduced. Secondly, a day-ahead peak-shaving dispatch model for PV-HPS systems is proposed. Then, the model is transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem using an efficient linearization method. Finally, case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PV-HPS model in achieving peak shaving and valley filling."

However, traditional models often fail maintain segmentation accuracy owing to noise injection and restricted parameter exchange. Hence, this research proposes a novel framework called secure aggregation and homomorphic entropy-based federated learning (SAHE-FL) for Brain Tumor (BT) segmentation. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans were collected from Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS)2020 dataset. The collected data were then preprocessed using intensity normalization, bounding-box cropping, and uniform volume resizing, followed by widespread data augmentation to improve generalization. Subsequently, the processed data were fed into 3Dimensional Fully Convolutional Neural Network (3D U-Net) architecture to extract both local tumor boundaries and global contextual features from various MRI modalities. In addition, SAHE-FL incorporates secure aggregation with homomorphic encryption, which confirms client model updates remain encrypted and masked throughout training, thereby removing need for artificial noise while preserving accuracy. Finally, a secure aggregation mechanism combined with homomorphic encryption safeguards that only aggregated updates was revealed providing reliable privacy protection without reducing model accuracy. Experimental results show that proposed SAHE-FL model attained superior results in terms of sensitivity 0.90% than existing Differential Privacy and Partial Weight Sharing-based Federated Learning (DP-PWS-FL) model."

Significant progress has been made in detecting such threats. Academic research has been published and the security industry has developed effective cybersecurity products in various areas, such as SIEM, EDR, and UEBA. Still, in recent times, we have noticed an increase in APT activities, and APT detection time has not improved much in the last few years. To effectively detect APTs, a combination of multiple approaches is necessary, such as event correlation, data provenance, and malware analysis, etc. This paper reviews research literature on techniques, tools, and surveys for APT detection and defense.

We propose a novel hierarchical system for in-vehicle MR that separates the user’s pose relative to the vehicle from the vehicle’s global pose. By using an edge device with a high-precision Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to estimate the vehicle’s state, and fusing gyroscope-based tracking with marker-based localization for the user, our system demonstrates a promising approach. Experiments show our method significantly outperforms a commercial solution, reducing the average localization error from 164.68m to 8.45m."

    "abstract": "A novel method is proposed that allows the controller designer to directly define the minimum and maximum values for the switching frequency in a finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC)-based controller. If no solution exists, the method will relax the constraints to find a fair solution, avoiding infeasibility. The method was tested with an FCS-MPC formulation called predictive torque control (PTC), which was implemented to control a voltage source inverter that drives an induction motor. For the classical PTC implementation, the switching frequency components were distributed from 243 Hz to 12500 Hz. Using the proposed PTC with bounded switching frequency, it was possible to successfully meet the minimum switching frequency constraint of 1000 Hz, important to avoid mechanical resonance on an induction machine, and the maximum switching frequency constraint of 8333 Hz, considered to reduce the commutation power losses."

    "abstract": "Paddy is a major staple crop in India, and each year, its cultivation is significantly affected by various leaf diseases. Early detection of these diseases can play a crucial role in minimizing crop damage and improving yield outcomes. The goal of this paper is to design a deep learning-based model for automated diagnosis of five main paddy leaf diseases, i.e., bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, hispa, blast, and tungro. A MF-TLSTM (Modified tanh Long-Short-Term Memory)-based classifier model with attention mechanism has been designed for this purpose. First, preprocessing is performed on the paddy leaf images. The operations conducted during this stage include normalization, median filtering, and resizing. After preprocessing, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based method is employed to extract features from the paddy leaf images. These extracted features are then used to train the designed classifier model. The obtained accuracy of the designed MF-TLSTM model is 95.55 %. A user-friendly Android application has also been developed to assist farmers in detecting paddy leaf diseases. The novelty of the paper lies in: 1) proposing MF-TLSTM, a robust variant of TLSTM, and employing it as a classifier, and 2) utilizing an attention mechanism to enhance the paddy leaf disease detection efficacy of the designed classifier."

    "abstract": "Shared control provides a human-centered development direction for intelligent driving. However, existing shared control methodologies address the risk factors related to both the driver and the traffic environment inadequately. To this end, a shared steering control strategy is proposed based on the driver-vehicle-road (DVR) system risk assessment result. Firstly, the driver’s steering behavior is described through a two-point preview driver model. The key parameters are identified using real driving data. Meanwhile, the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is applied to train a reinforcement learning (RL) agent considering tracking accuracy, steering smoothness and vehicle stability as the autonomous driving controller. Afterwards, three time-varying risk factors are designed to evaluate the DVR system risk level, which represent driver risk, road risk and lane departure risk, respectively. Based on the system risk level, the control authority is initially calculated by a fuzzy inference method. Then, considering the smoothness of authority transition, a model prediction control (MPC) method is applied to optimize the initial authority level in real-time. Finally, simulation and the driver-in-the-loop (DIL) experiments are performed to validate the proposed strategy. The results demonstrate that the proposed shared control strategy could reduce driving burden and demonstrates distinct superiority in terms of human-machine collaboration, driving comfort and personalized support."

Among these, the human-machine authority allocation remains a key focus of widespread attention. Pilot task performance prediction is crucial for optimizing the authority allocation. In this study, we explored the application of deep learning technology to pilot performance prediction in WVR air combat, proposing a multi-modal deep learning framework. First, we built a dedicated pilot multi-modal database for WVR air combat research, which includes 13 pilots. Then, we designed the hierarchical attention (HA), spatial frequency channel attention (SFCA), and edge-aware graph attention network autoencoder (EAGAT-AE) modules to extract intra-modal features from pilots' physiological states, control behaviors, and combat situations respectively.We also introduced a cross-modal gated attention fusion (CMGAF) module for adaptive fusion of cross-modal features. Finally, we developed a Transformer encoder-based fully connected predictor (TEFP) module to learn the temporal dynamics of cross-modal features and predict pilot task performance. Through 10-fold cross-validation and leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, our model achieved an average accuracy of 94.43% and 84.73% respectively, indicating our method provides an objective means of predicting pilot task performance and holds promise for application in real-world WVR air combat."

    "abstract": "Human activity recognition (HAR) requires extracting accurate spatial-temporal features with human movements. A mmWave radar point cloud-based HAR system suffers from sparsity and variable-size problems due to the physical features of the mmWave signal. Existing works usually borrow the preprocessing algorithms for the vision-based systems with dense point clouds, which may not be optimal for mmWave radar systems. In this work, we proposed a graph representation with a discrete dynamic graph neural network (DDGNN) to explore the spatial-temporal representation of human movement-related features. Specifically, we designed a star graph to describe the high-dimensional relative relationship between a manually added static center point and the dynamic mmWave radar points in the same and consecutive frames. We then adopted DDGNN to learn the features residing in the star graph with variable sizes. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach outperformed other baseline methods using real-world HAR datasets. Our system achieved an overall classification accuracy of 94.27%, which gets the near-optimal performance with a vision-based skeleton data accuracy of 97.25%. We also conducted an inference test on Raspberry Pi 4 to demonstrate its effectiveness on resource-constraint platforms. We provided a comprehensive ablation study for variable DDGNN structures to validate our model design. Our system also outperformed three recent radar-specific methods without requiring resampling or frame aggregators."

    "abstract": "Flight safety remains a central concern in civil aviation. Recently, increasing attention has been given to leveraging high-dimensional temporal flight data, typically collected by Quick Access Recorders (QAR), to predict safety events. However, most existing studies focus on individual events, overlooking the latent correlations among multiple events. For instance, during landing, a maneuver that reduces the risk of one event may inadvertently increase the risk of another. Predicting multiple events introduces three main challenges: 1)handling parameters recorded at inconsistent sampling rates, 2) learning task-specific parameter importance for interpretability, and 3) modeling complex temporal dependencies for accuracy. To address these, we propose MultiSafe, a deep multi-task learning model for predicting and interpreting multiple flight safety events. First, to process parameters with heterogeneous frequencies, we introduce a Multi-Scale Shared Encoder with adaptive convolutional kernels to unify representations across tasks. Next, a gating-based Parameter Selector learns task-specific parameter importance, enabling interpretable predictions. Finally, a Temporal Decoder with fine-grained attention captures intricate temporal dependencies among parameters. Experiments on a dataset of 37,518 A320 flight records demonstrate that MultiSafe outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy, while its interpretability offers actionable insights to assist pilots in enhancing flight safety."

    "abstract": "Composite insulated cross-arm (CICA) can be used in high voltage transmission lines to substitute composite insulators with iron cross-arms. In addition to its excellent insulation performance, CICA can also save on transmission corridors, etc. Nevertheless, due to the horizontal arrangement, CICA bears complex mechanical stresses in addition to the high temperature and humidity environmental factors. The aging mechanism under the multifactor coupling effect is studied in this paper based on a 110 kV CICA. The test results of the interface property show that the hygrothermal factor is the main reason for aging. In addition, stress affects the interface properties by promoting moisture penetration. The interfacial current changes can be divided into three stages: the voltage-current synchronous growth stage, the voltage-continuous current plunge stage, and the interfacial breakdown stage, during the multi-factor aging process. Besides, the CICA experiments show a synergistic effect between the hygrothermal and mechanical factors in the deterioration process of the silicone rubber and the core rod. Constant force and high and low circumferential cyclic forces mainly affect the mechanical properties. This work can be helpful for the application and promotion of CICA."

    "abstract": "In the modern semiconductor industry, Silicon photonics stands at the forefront as an emerging interdisciplinary department that seeks to combine photonics and electronics on a singular silicon substrate. This combination of conventional electronic circuits and the rapid data transmission capabilities of optical communication has attracted substantial attention due to its potential to transform data communication, computing, sensing and more. Silicon photonics attempts to convert electronic signals into optical signals, facilitating data transmission at remarkable velocities. This is achieved by leveraging photonic components such as waveguides, modulators, detectors, and multiplexers all meticulously engineered using conventional silicon fabrication methodologies. The major component in silicon photonics is the silicon waveguide, a small structure that steers light, enabling its propagation with minimal attenuation. Silicon’s compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processes expedites the integration of photonic and electronic components on a single chip. III-V materials such as Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) and Indium Phosphide (InP) are used as substrates of opto-electronic devices like vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSEL), edge emitting lasers and light emitting diodes. System in Package integration of the III-V materials to silicon requires a reliable bonding technique. The present study proposes four different interconnect design namely Annular, semiannular, flat pad and solder balls between GaAs substrate and SOI wafer. A finite element model of the package is created using Ansys and analyzed using Ansys Thermal module. Different designs are evaluated for their thermal and reliability performances in the GaAs/Si integrated circuits. The advantages and short comings of each interconnect design is discussed and suggestions are made about the aafinity of each configuration for different applications."

However, traditional Deep Learning (DL) models often face session-to-session variability, where electrode shifts and recording situations present domain shifts that decrease the reliability. To address these challenges, this research proposes a Session-Invariant Electroencephalography (EEG) Biometric (SIEB) framework that incorporates a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) with a domain-adaptive (DA) module for robust subject identification. Initially, EEG signals were collected from the PhysioNet Motor Movement dataset, which consisted of 1,500 recordings from 109 individuals. Then, the collected data were preprocessed using bandpass filtering, artifact removal, normalization, and segmentation to remove noise from the data. Subsequently, the preprocessed signals were fed as input into the SCNN, which was enhanced using a gradient-reversal adversarial head to implement session-invariant embeddings. In addition, a prototype alignment loss was employed to stabilize each subject's features and maintain consistency across the recordings. Finally, the proposed Domain-Adaptive (DA-SCNN) attained accurate identification of biometrics. Experimental results show that proposed DA-SCNN attained 95.7% accuracy in delta-band baseline identification and established greater robustness under cross-session conditions when compared to conventional Siamese models."

    "abstract": "With the continuous deepening of digital transformation in the e-commerce industry, user interaction data is showing a trend of high frequency and massive growth, which puts forward higher requirements for platforms in realtime analysis and precise decision-making. Traditional batch processing architectures often exhibit issues such as high latency, insufficient scalability, and lagging feedback when dealing with high-concurrency data streams, making it difficult to meet the demands of refined operation and intelligent decision-making. To this end, this paper proposes an ecommerce real-time user behavior analysis system based on a distributed stream computing framework. This system builds a task scheduling-driven stream structure relying on an inmemory computing engine and significantly enhances the realtime processing capability of large-scale behavioral data by leveraging multi-node parallelism and fault-tolerant mechanisms. In terms of algorithm design, the system introduces an improved initial centroid optimization strategy to enhance clustering accuracy and combines the feature patterns of user behavior sequences to achieve dynamic modeling, which can effectively depict user preferences and behavioral tendencies. Meanwhile, in response to the detection requirements for abnormal traffic and malicious operations, the system has designed a dynamic discrimination mechanism based on time Windows, and combined it with a threshold perception-driven blacklist filtering strategy and asynchronous statistical methods to predict the popularity trend of user interaction content, thereby supporting precise decision-making in key business scenarios such as advertising placement and resource scheduling. The experimental results show that the system demonstrates excellent real-time response capability and behavior recognition accuracy in a high-concurrency environment, with stable algorithm performance and high deployable value.

    "abstract": "In the context of \"dual carbon\" goals, achieving deep carbon reduction in integrated energy systems (IES) and optimizing the complex coupling and synergy between multiple energy carriers such as electricity, heat, and natural gas are pressing issues in the current field of IES operation and scheduling. To address these challenges effectively, the integration of market mechanisms (e.g., green certificate-carbon joint mechanism) with advanced energy technologies (e.g., hydrogen-doped natural gas utilization) is considered an effective approach to enhance the low-carbon economy, operational flexibility, and renewable energy absorption capacity of IES. This paper aims to construct an innovative IES optimization scheduling model, which deeply couples hydrogen-doped natural gas into a green certificate-carbon joint mechanism for the first time and integrates relevant technologies to achieve carbon cycle and energy transformation. The study intends to realize low-carbon operation, economic enhancement, and efficient absorption of renewable energy through multidimensional collaborative optimization. It establishes a mathematical model of IES that includes electrical, natural gas, thermal, and hydrogen energy flows, converting the system's environmental benefits into quantifiable economic incentives by introducing a green certificate-carbon joint trading mechanism. The research results will validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in significantly reducing total system operating costs and carbon emissions, greatly enhancing renewable energy absorption capacity. This study fills the current literature gap in IES optimization scheduling by simultaneously considering the green certificate-carbon joint mechanism and hydrogen-doped natural gas, providing important theoretical and technical support for the green and sustainable development of future IES."

    "abstract": "Lithium-ion pouch cells used in mobile devices often swell due to electrolyte decomposition and gas formation. Traditional CC-CV methods use fixed temperature thresholds, reacting only after unsafe conditions arise to mitigate the risk of battery swelling. This study proposes a charging control method based on fuzzy logic to prevent battery swelling. The method combines a Power Management Integrated Circuit (PMIC) and a fuzzy controller to dynamically adjust the charging current using real-time temperature and voltage data based on fuzzy inference. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fuzzy logic controller reduced charging time by 14.7 % at an ambient temperature (25° C), with an increase in peak current from 2079 mA to 2761 mA. Under elevated thermal conditions (35° C), charging time was reduced by 26.5 %, while the maximum battery temperature decreased from 41° C to 38° C. Additionally, the fuzzy method exhibited lower current variability, indicating improved thermal regulation to avoid the swelling effect and enhanced charging stability for mobile devices."

    "abstract": "As cloud computing grows, data centers face new challenges in energy consumption, particularly with cooling. Data center electricity consumption is forecast to rise to $\\sim 1300 \\mathrm{TWh}$ by 2030; sufficient energy is needed to supply electricity to approximately 123 million homes for a year. The objective of this project is to develop an energy efficient two-phase cooling system for data centers to reduce cooling energy consumption from 40% to less than 5% of the total energy expenditure consumed. Moreover, this technology enables greater utilization of the processing power by reducing core throttling. To achieve this objective, a novel additively manufactured two-phase wick structure and manifold were developed. Building on our prior work, the copper wick structure was printed directly onto the silicon chip without a thermal interface material (TIM) to achieve a low total thermal resistance (below $0.01 \\mathrm{~K} / \\mathrm{W}$), where thermal resistance represents the resistance to heat flow from the heat source (e.g., a chip) to the surrounding environment. A novel laser printed inter-material bonded to silicon by rapid formation of nm thin silicide. The wick structure was then printed directly onto the inter-material by rapid intermetallic bonding. The required porosity and microstructure in the wick structure were achieved through a parameter optimization study. Complementary microscopy (optical, SEM) was used to analyze the wick structure. A porosity of 38% was achieved. This porosity is within the desired range. Thermal conductivities varied between $16.4 \\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{m} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}$ and $127.5 \\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{m} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}$ as the porosity varied from $26-38 \\%$. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) plays a crucial role in the reliability and mechanical stability of the bonded wick structure. A mismatch in CTE between the wick structure and the silicon chip can lead to thermal stresses during operation, potentially causing delamination, interfacial cracks, or mechanical failure over time. The measured CTE of $16.7 \\times 10^{-6} 1 /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ at 38% porosity indicates good compatibility with silicon, minimizing thermal stress and enhancing bond strength. This ensures long-term structural integrity and reliable heat dissipation, making the two-phase cooling system more robust for high-performance data center applications."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely employed for network intrusion detection due to their ability to capture spatial and sequential traffic patterns. However, existing intrusion detection systems often fail when subjected to adversarial perturbations, where attackers slightly manipulate the traffic features to evade detection. This vulnerability highlights the pressing challenge of building adversarially robust cybersecurity models. Hence, this research proposes Semantics-Aware Adversarial Training using CNN (SAAT-CNN) for intrusion detection. Initially, the input data were collected from the CICIDS2017 dataset, which contains realistic benign and malicious traffic. Then, the collected data are preprocessed to handle the missing values, numeric features are normalized using Standardscaler, label encoding is employed to transform the categorical features, and domain constraints are defined to preserve feature semantics. Furthermore, a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1 \\mathrm{D}-\\text{CNN}$</tex> is trained for initial intrusion classification, and adversarial examples are then generated using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) within domain-preserving bounds. Finally, adversarial training was employed on the mixed clean and perturbed data to minimize false negatives. The proposed SAAT-CNN provided better results in terms of detection accuracy (99.99 %) when compared to the existing 1D-CNN model."

This work investigates the covert communication and the physical layer security of the RIS assisted rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) system at the presence of multiple randomly distributed malicious users, where the non-colluding and the colluding behaviors of malicious users are considered. To characterize the channel statistics, we derive a Gamma distribution to approximate the Nakagami-<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$m$</tex-math></inline-formula> channel for RIS assisted links. For the covert communication performance analysis, we first derive the closed form expressions of the detection error probability (DEP) for the non-colluding and the colluding wardens. Then the analytical ergodic covert rate (ECR) is also deduced. For the physical layer security performance analysis, we obtain the theoretical expressions of the secrecy outage probability (SOP) for the non-colluding and the colluding eavesdroppers. And the closed form expressions of the asymptotic SOP in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region are derived to provide more insightful guidelines. The analytical results show that RSMA is able to meet different demands of covert performance, and the detection threshold depends on the number of RIS elements and the power distribution coefficient of RSMA to maximize the DEP. The numerical results illustrate that: 1) RIS-RSMA can realize a higher covert performance than RIS assisted transmissions; 2) a lower SOP can be achieved by deploying RIS with more elements."

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a progressive skeletal disorder characterized by reduced bone mass and deterioration of bone microarchitecture, significantly increasing fracture risk, particularly among the elderly. Early detection of osteoporosis is vital for preventing fractures, reducing healthcare burdens, and improving patient quality of life. Medical imaging, particularly X-ray analysis, offers a non-invasive and accessible approach for screening. In this research, we propose a robust feature extraction and classification framework for osteoporosis detection using publicly available knee X-ray osteoporosis datasets. We employ a Phi-grid based block division method to partition X-ray images into meaningful regions, from which handcrafted local features (texture, frequency, statistical, spatial, and structural descriptors) are extracted. These handcrafted features are combined with Vision Transformer (ViT)-enabled features to effectively capture both local and global image representations. The resulting feature sets, considered individually and in combination, are fed into a deep learning-based hybrid GAMLP-Net classifier, which integrates ResNet MLP and Autoencoder blocks enhanced with attention mechanisms to improve feature representation and classification robustness. The model performs classification for both binary class (Normal vs. Osteoporosis) and multiclass (Normal, Osteopenia, Osteoporosis) tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the combined feature representation significantly improves classification accuracy and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach for automated osteoporosis diagnosis."

This method combines the advantages of both frequency spectrum and AC partial discharge pattern analysis. Defect classification was performed using a convolutional neural network model under conditions with both noise and partial discharge signals. Additionally, explainable artificial intelligence technology was applied to visualize the regions influencing the pattern classification process. Extending the time-series partial discharge signals into the frequency domain effectively separates partial discharges from noise and classifies them under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions."

    "abstract": "Noninvasively predicting the status of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and chromosome arms 1p/19q preoperatively on multisequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images is helpful for prognosis and optimal therapy planning of patients with gliomas. However, effectively learning discriminative features from MRI images for predicting IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion status remains challenging due to the high heterogeneity of gliomas. A dual structural feature exploration and alignment network (DSFEAnet) was proposed to effectively explore representative features associated with the intratumoral and marginal heterogeneity of gliomas for accurate prediction. First, a match and mismatch feature extraction (MMFE) module was introduced to extract image structural features related to intratumoral heterogeneity, such as information associated with tumor core localization and T2-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) mismatch sign. Second, a graph-based geometry exploration (GGE) module was developed to explore graph structural features related to marginal heterogeneity. In this module, the vertex associations and variations perpendicularly along a 3-D tumor surface were integrated as a graph, which can effectively perceive changes in locations, sizes, and marginal textures of gliomas, thus enhancing the feature representational ability to describe glioma heterogeneity. Finally, a dual structural feature alignment (DSFA) module was incorporated to narrow the gaps among intra- and interstructural features. It can adaptively align and fuse different features and thus further improve the overall prediction performance. The proposed DSFEAnet was evaluated using a multicenter dataset, and its robustness was demonstrated on an independent clinical dataset. Specifically, preoperative MRI images of 560 glioma samples were collected from publicly available The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$n =203$</tex-math> </inline-formula>, age: 51.82 (15.21) years, male/female: 109/94, IDH-mutant/wild-type: 90/113, 1p/19q-codeleted/noncodeleted: 27/176), Nanfang hospital (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$n =136$</tex-math> </inline-formula>, age: 41.96 (12.29) years, male/female: 80/56, IDH-mutant/wild-type: 53/83, 1p/19q-codeleted/noncodeleted: 31/105), and Zhujiang hospital (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$n =221$</tex-math> </inline-formula>, age: 43.82 (17.36) years, male/female: 134/87, IDH-mutant/wild-type: 94/127, 1p/19q-codeleted/noncodeleted: 34/187).

The proposed strategy avoids explicitly incorporating the control gain matrices into the control algorithms and does not require them to be invertible, thereby significantly broadening the applicability of AILC. In the proposed AILC method, a newly designed virtual control gain matrix is introduced, enabling the transformation of the unknown control gain matrix into a form of norm-bounded system uncertainty while accounting for input saturation. Building on this reformulation, a structurally simple AILC scheme is developed, incorporating an input-dependent auxiliary system to mitigate the effects of input constraints. Moreover, the proposed method is extended to nonaffine nonlinear systems by integrating neural network techniques. The convergence of the proposed AILC laws is rigorously analyzed within the composite energy function (CEF) framework, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through implementation on a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) and a numerical example of a nonaffine system."

Since spectral variations of different ground objects often manifest more prominently in specific wavelength bands, we design a Weighted Cascaded Encoder-Decoder Network based on spatial-spectral difference features for hyperspectral change detection. Firstly, unlike conventional change detection frameworks based on siamese networks, our proposed single-branch approach focuses more intensively on extracting spatial-spectral difference features. Secondly, the weighted cascaded structure introduced in the encoder stage enables differential attention to different bands, enhancing focus on spectral bands with high responsiveness. Furthermore, we have developed a spatial-spectral cross-attention module to model intra-feature correlations within spatial and spectral domains. Our method was evaluated on three challenging hyperspectral change detection datasets, and experimental results demonstrate its superior performance compared to competitive models.

However, existing dual-mode sensors often face challenges such as environmental interference, large sizes, and task-specific limitations. This study proposes a dual-mode photoelectric sensor that integrates tactile and proximity sensing. The tactile sensing mechanism is based on a variable optical path structure, while the proximity sensing relies on the surface light reflection. The sensor exhibits a high sensitivity (up to 1.12 V/N), compactness (4 mm thickness), and desirable stability with a drift of less than 1% over 8,000 repetitive cycles under pressures ranging from 0 to 63 kPa. A general tactile-proximity servoing framework is also proposed for the dual-mode sensor array which enables tactile servoing, proximity servoing and hybrid tactile-proximity servoing. Under this framework, parameters can be flexibly adjusted to adapt to different servoing tasks including position and orientation control of the robotic arm's end-effector. In more complex robotic tasks, a real-time fruit ripeness classification method is developed based on the proposed sensor. Using the proposed TPNet, the classification method can achieve an accuracy of 94.4% in a four-level tomato ripeness classification task during grasping."

Additionally, the proposed column-layered algorithm shares up-to-date information among columns, enhancing the convergence speed of the baseline design. Considering the structure of high-rate NB-LDPC codes, we introduce multi-column processing with an optimized banked memory architecture while minimizing parallel processing overhead through submodule optimization. Fabricated using a 28-nm CMOS technology, the prototype 4KB 0.9-rate decoder achieves a 1.42-fold improvement in area efficiency compared to state-of-the-art designs. While the proposed design is motivated by the requirements of storage applications, its modular organization and scalable parallelism also allow adaptation to diverse domains such as wireless and optical communications."

    "abstract": "Early detection of breast cancer is critical for improving patient outcomes, and deep learning (DL) has shown promise in mammographic analysis. However, many existing systems tackle a single task (e.g., malignancy classification) and provide limited interpretability, which hinders clinical adoption. We present a multi-task, attention-guided framework that <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">jointly</i> predicts malignancy (benign vs. malignant) and BI-RADS breast density (A–D) from a single mammogram while producing interpretable attention maps. The architecture couples a pretrained convolutional backbone with lightweight channel–spatial attention and two task-specific heads. We evaluate six backbones (ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0/B3/B7, MobileNetV3-Large) under a rigorous evaluation protocol with stratified hold-out split (64%/16%/20%) and 5-fold cross-validation. To support reliable deployment, we report comprehensive metrics including discrimination measures (ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity), calibration metrics (Brier score, Expected Calibration Error), and ablation studies contrasting single-task vs. multi-task learning and models with vs. without attention mechanisms. Across all evaluation protocols, multi-task learning consistently outperforms single-task baselines by 2.8% in pathology accuracy and 3.5% in density estimation, indicating that density cues provide complementary information for malignancy assessment. Among backbones, EfficientNet-B3 attains the strongest discrimination (AUC=0.962, accuracy=93.6%) on hold-out test with excellent calibration (Brier=0.010), while MobileNetV3-Large achieves competitive performance (AUC=0.940, accuracy=91.2%) with only 4.26M parameters—an optimal accuracy–efficiency trade-off for resource-constrained deployment. Cross-validation results demonstrate robust generalization (AUC=0.954 ± 0.003, accuracy=93.0 ± 0.3%). Attention maps highlight diagnostically relevant regions including architectural distortions and suspicious calcifications, offering interpretable visual rationale aligned with radiological assessment. We discuss limitations including dataset size (410 images), class imbalance in rare density categories, and calibration challenges (ECE=0.365–0.419), and outline directions for external validation on multi-institutional cohorts and integration of uncertainty quantification methods."

    "abstract": "Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) enables users to handle resource-intensive and latency-sensitive tasks. However, the offloading behaviors, which are closely correlated with wireless channel conditions, can inadvertently reveal users' location information to untrustworthy MEC servers. Existing location privacy-aware task offloading (LPTO) mechanisms have not fully considered and comprehensively analyzed personalized location privacy protection requirements. To address this gap, this paper proposes a differential privacy (DP)-based personalized LPTO mechanism for MEC environments that jointly optimizes the perturbation region, privacy budget, and offloading rate while maximizing the offloading utility. We quantify personalized privacy requirements by incorporating task sensitivity, user privacy preference, and task priority. Then, we propose a two-timescale (2Ts) optimization framework to solve the complex personalized location privacy-aware task offloading optimization problem. Specifically, we optimize the perturbation region on a long timescale to align with long-term privacy requirements. In contrast, the offloading ratio and privacy budget are dynamically optimized on a short timescale based on instantaneous channel states and offloading workloads. Furthermore, we model the privacy-aware offloading problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and develop a dual-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based personalized LPTO mechanism (DDPLM) to optimize strategies under dynamic MEC systems. Simulation results validate that the proposed DDPLM achieves personalized location privacy protection while reducing computational costs."

    "abstract": "We present the first systematic study on communication-efficient evaluation of the lightweight cipher family Ascon within secure multi-party computation (MPC). By leveraging Ascon’s parallel, bit-oriented structure, we adapt its design using Reverse Multiplication-Friendly Embeddings (RMFEs, introduced by Cascudo et al. in CRYPTO’18) in a single-circuit evaluation, enabling efficient packing of groups of bits into field elements. Our protocol, which uses relatively small RMFEs, achieves substantial reductions in communication cost compared to baseline MPC protocols. For example, in a medium-sized setting (with n = 13 MPC parties), our protocol reduces the communication cost for an Ascon permutation by roughly 38%. For large amounts of parties (e.g., n = 255), the reduction can reach 50%. These improvements are achieved even though RMFEs only pack a few bits per field element, due to favorable amortization of both substitution and linear layers. We also provide a Boolean circuit implementation of Ascon in the MP-SPDZ framework, enabling straightforward benchmarking. Our findings are particularly beneficial for bandwidth-constrained environments where the use of lightweight ciphers, such as Ascon, is necessary due to the resource limitations of client devices, as in the case of transciphering data from IoT sensors. Since our optimizations target the Ascon permutation, they naturally extend to all cryptographic modes (encryption, decryption, hashing) defined for the standard."

Higher bandwidth comes with higher power consumption of optics and switch Application Specific Integrated Circuit(ASIC). Conventional air cooling solution is more and more challenging to meet the thermal requirement for next-generation 1.6T optics and 102.4T switch ASIC. In response to the high-performance computing and energy-saving requirements of the Information Technology(IT) industry, liquid cooling technology has emerged rapidly in recent years. In this paper, single-phase cold plate liquid cooling solution is studied to identify thermal feasibility and thermal improvement for 30 W Octal Small Form Factor Pluggable(OSFP) optics and 750 W Tomahawk 5(TH5) ASIC in a 2 U switch system. First, 2 kinds of cold plates for OSFP are explored and optimized by Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD) simulation analysis to achieve the optimal thermal performance and pressure drop. Second, experiments are carried out to investigate the effects of power consumption, coolant inlet temperature, and coolant flow rate on the thermal performance. The cold plate solution can support higher power consumption of $35 \\mathrm{~W}+$ OSFP with a flow rate of 2 LPM at $40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ coolant inlet temperature, while 20 W by air cooling. The thermal performance of TH5 cold plate is $0.026^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} / \\mathrm{W}$, which is 8% better than the first-generation cold plate and 48% better than the air-cooled solution [1]. Furthermore, thermal correlation analysis between simulation and experiments has a high agreement with a deviation within 5%, which can provide a significant reference for the future development of single-phase cold plate liquid cooling solution."

This paper comprehensively investigates the thermal management of printed circuit board (PCB)-based planar inductors used in high-power converters through active liquid cooling. The study specifically explores embedded cooling technology to improve the heat dissipation efficiency of a planar inductor design. Three cooling configurations are analyzed: 1) a baseline case with single-sided active liquid cooling of the component package; 2) an improved case with double-sided liquid cooling of the package; and 3) a novel proposed method utilizing hybrid double-sided cooling with embedded liquid cooling of the component. Thermal modeling and simulation results are presented for all three cases to evaluate their effectiveness in dissipating heat. The initial numerical results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid cooling technique significantly enhances thermal performance by reducing hot spots inside the planar magnetic component and provides more uniform temperature distribution across the inductor windings. This method shows promise for high-power density applications where efficient thermal management is essential."

    "abstract": "Early stress detection and measurement is a crucial strategy because it is important to take action immediately to prevent stress from increasing and leading to potential health issues. The system relies on heart rate variability (HRV), which is collected from ECG. The system presents the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a Machine Learning (ML) model for stress level classification using features selected by lasso regression. CNN directly receives feeds from some cases that have known the imbalanced class issues. An important part of the system deals with the distribution of class imbalance in the training data. In training data, some classes of user stress levels have fewer samples than others. This aspect is addressed by the method of stratified k-fold cross-validation. Stratified k-fold cross-validation is a method of cross-validation in which each fold of the cross-validation keeps the same ratio as the original dataset, including the smaller classes in reasonable representation in both training and evaluation. The system provides fair representation of all classes while providing precise real-time stress detection. However, the need for a several-fold increase in the total amount of time resulting in a longer duration. The High Performance Computing (HPC) parallel execution is used by the system to address this problem. Because the HPC architecture distributes tasks among several processors, it maximizes resource usage and drastically cuts down on total elapsed time. From the experimental results, 5-fold stratified cross-validation on ML with HPC parallel processing based on the Message Passing Interface (MPI) achieves the highest accuracy (0.9999) and the lowest MAE (0.0001), showing superior reliability and efficiency for stress level classification."

    "abstract": "In recent years, rapid advancements in LED (Light Emitting Diode) technology have enabled high-brightness white LEDs—with superior features such as energy efficiency and long lifespan—to replace incandescent, halogen, and fluorescent lamps. However, with this transformation, the requirements for high power factor (PF) and low total harmonic distortion (THD) have become prominent to achieve energy savings and reduce environmental impacts. In this paper, the development of low-cost and highly efficient power converter topologies has emerged as a valuable research area. The SEPIC (Single-Ended Primary-Inductor Converter), which offers a single-stage structure, stands out as an ideal solution in non-isolated applications due to its ability to perform both boost and buck operations. Operating the SEPIC topology in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) allows the input current too closely follow the input voltage, thereby reducing harmonic distortion and enabling a high-power factor. In this study, A 30W SEPIC-based LED driver for automotive lighting systems is designed and implemented, achieving an output voltage of 21V from a wide input voltage range of 9V to 36V. Experimental results show a high efficiency of 91.3% at full load, 94.6% at half load, and up to 95.2% during low-beam dimming operation. This study introduces a robust and efficient reference design for LED drivers supporting high-beam, low-beam, daytime running light (DRL) functions, offering valuable insights for both academic and industrial applications."

Given the inherent challenges posed by model complexity and non-linear parameter interactions, genetic algorithms (GA), differential evolution (DE) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are evaluated using synthetic voltage-current data. Although GA and PSO have been extensively employed in physics-based arc modeling, the use of DE in empirical models remains underexplored. The results demonstrate the potential of these methods to improve parameter identification accuracy, thereby offering a promising approach to improve arc modeling and associated fault detection strategies."

    "abstract": "Stress detection in online discourse has gained significance with the rapid rise in numbers of people using social media to express their feeling, ideas. However, it becomes difficult to identify stress in text because it often shows through emojis, slang, sarcasm, informal language, and emotional tones. The task is challenging for detecting stress from the text as, it can be informal, sarcasm, slang, emojis and emotion tone. The proposed framework overcomes the challenges by using the machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) approaches to identify stress indicators of stress in text-based social interactions. In this paper “Stress” is defined as the way people express psychological strain, emotional exhaustion, or pressure in social interactions, which makes stands out it from general negative sentiment. The RoBERTa, T5 and BERTopic transformers models are used for a specific tasks: sentiment analysis, emotion classification, sarcasm detection, spam filtering, and emoji mapping. These models are trained on different open source datasets. The output of five sub-models is combined, the final binary class output: Stress or Not Stress is provided for each input. The model is implemented and their performance is measured by using metrics like f1 score and accuracy. The experimental results of the proposed integrated multi-Stage framework system gained accuracy of 94.42%, with precision and recall scores averaging 0.94. A real time web interface, developed using Streamlit which allows user friendly interaction."

The suggested device's channel potential model is used to develop an analytical model of mobile charge density. The proposed model is verified by comparing the model data of drain current as a function of gate-to-source voltage with simulation results. According to the findings of the mobile charge density analysis, the mobile charge decreases as channel length and doping concentration rise, which results in low drive current and subpar device performance. But the device performance improves with the increase in mobile charge density when channel thickness, oxide thickness, and applied drain bias enhances."

    "abstract": "Gallium nitride (GaN) high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) have been paving the way for 5G radio frequency (RF) wireless communication technologies. However, the extremely high operational heat flux leads to device overheating, which makes it necessary for GaN HEMTs to be operated under derated power conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to understand which component of the internal thermal resistance network primarily contributes to the channel temperature rise. In this work, the junction-to-heat sink thermal resistances of GaN HEMTs mounted on a high-power laminate CuMo base package were analyzed using micro-Raman thermometry and device thermal modeling. It was found that the thermal resistance associated with the GaN buffer layer, and the substrate primarily contribute to the junction-to-heat sink thermal resistance, respectively. In addition, the thermal resistance associated with the die attach material exhibits a notable effect ($\\sim 10 \\%$) on the device channel temperature rise. The findings of this work shed insight into the design of device-topackage level thermal management solutions for GaN monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs)."

We establish a rigorous mathematical framework based on three fundamental theorems that characterize the stability, resonance properties, and synchronization behavior of these networks. Through extensive discrete-time simulations of a 50 -neuron network, we demonstrate excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and numerical results. Our findings reveal that the network maintains stability across a wide range of feedback strengths while exhibiting precisely predictable scaling relationships: linear scaling of deviation from reference orbits and quadratic scaling of synchronization measures. The network demonstrates robust frequencyselective response to input signals, with clear spectral peaks at the stimulus frequency and no spurious oscillations. Lyapunov stability analysis confirms the theoretical predictions, and resonance characteristics show safe operational margins from critical conditions. These results provide concrete design principles for constructing stable oscillatory networks and establish a foundation for applications in signal processing, pattern recognition, and computational neuroscience. The work bridges theoretical mathematics with practical neural network implementation, offering insights into temporal processing mechanisms in both artificial and biological neural systems."

To explore how time management tools can support productive and healthy VR work, we preliminarily compared physical and VR-integrated Pomodoro timers. We identified a key design trade-off: the VR timer improved time awareness but introduced distractions, while the physical timer supported sustained focus yet caused discomfort due to abrupt alerts and limited continuous awareness.

The environment of cable tunnels has a direct impact on the current ampacity of cables. This article explores the effects of environmental parameters such as soil thermal conductivity, tunnel wall thermal conductivity, tunnel air temperature, ground surface temperature, and ground surface convective heat transfer coefficient on cable current ampacity. By adjusting the range of these parameters, analyze their impact on cable heat dissipation and current ampacity. And by calculating cables with different arrangements, provide the steady-state current ampacity results of the cables. The research results indicate that increasing the thermal conductivity of soil and tunnel walls, controlling the air temperature and surface temperature inside the tunnel, can all improve the heat dissipation effect of cables and significantly increase their current ampacity. The research provides scientific basis for optimizing the environment of cable tunnels, which is of great significance for designing more efficient and safe cable transmission systems.

Unlike conventional methods that utilize only the final output layer, our approach trains lightweight classifiers at multiple intermediate layers and combines their outputs through a majority voting scheme. This multi-level strategy harnesses diverse feature information and improves robustness to variations in visual freshness cues. In experiments, the ensemble classifier achieved a classification accuracy of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 6. 1 7 \\%}$</tex> under the majority voting strategy.

Accurate and timely diagnosis using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is critical but often limited by scarce radiological expertise and computational resources, particularly in underserved regions, affecting Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being). Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel at classifying brain tumors from MRI scans by extracting complex spatial features, yet centralized training requires large, aggregated datasets, raising privacy and logistical concerns. This paper proposes a federated learning (FL) framework for brain tumor classification, utilizing a harmonized dataset of 7,023 MRI scans from figshare, SARTAJ, and Br 35 H repositories, covering glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no-tumor classes. Using MobileNetV2 with finetuned layers, we simulate four healthcare institutions collaborating via federated averaging (FedAvg). In an IID setup with balanced data, the global model achieves 99 % accuracy, with precision, recall, and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{F 1}$</tex>-scores averaging <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{0. 9 9}$</tex>. In a nonIID setup reflecting real-world heterogeneity, the global model reaches 96.18 % accuracy after 20 rounds. Personalized finetuning improves local client performance, with accuracies up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 3. 4 4 \\%}$</tex> on the global validation set, demonstrating its efficacy in addressing data heterogeneity.

    "abstract": "Abstract-Detecting the presence of construction-related risks to cables in transmission corridors is crucial for the security of power systems. When unmanned inspection vehicles are deployed to detect potential hazards, multiple objects such as engineering vehicles, pedestrians, and utility covers need to be considered. To address the challenges of significant scale variations (due to changing distances) and strong background noise, this paper proposes an enhanced object detection model based on RT-DETR. The proposed model improves detection accuracy and robustness in such complex environments. Specifically, a C2f-PKI module is introduced in the backbone network to enhance feature retention for small objects. In the neck network, an AIFI-ASSA module is designed to improve feature extraction capability and suppress background interference. Additionally, an HAFB module with multi-branch extraction and hierarchical attention mechanisms is developed to strengthen the detection of dynamic targets and effectively integrate multi-scale features. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a 4.5% increase in recall and a mean average precision (mAP) of 91.8% compared to the baseline, outperforming YOLO series algorithms in transmission corridor object detection tasks."

    "abstract": "On-board charger (OBC) and auxiliary power module (APM) are crucial power electronic components in electric vehicles. The OBC converts AC input into DC output to charge the High-Voltage (HV) propulsion battery; while the APM connects the HV side and Low-Voltage (LV) side to charge the LV battery. To reduce costs, minimize size, and enhance power density, this paper studied a three-port current-fed triple-active bridge (CF-TAB) converter for integrating the OBC and the APM. This converter offers a streamlined structure and simplifies transformer design compared to traditional integration methods. In this paper, a five-control-variable optimal control scheme utilizing a look-up table method is proposed for the converter with the objectives of minimizing the switching loss of the converter. In addition, a hardware experimental platform for 3kW/200V-500V OBC plus 1kW/8V-16V APM is built and allows for the verification of the proposed control scheme's effectiveness. The results indicate that, in comparison to conventional DPS control, the new control scheme significantly reduces switching losses and extends the soft-switching range."

    "abstract": "Flow condensation of low surface tension fluids leads to filmwise condensation with inferior thermal performance. Here, 3D-printed converging wick structures are proposed to enhance the condensation heat transfer performance of low surface tension fluids. The metallic wick structure improves the effective condensate-wick thermal conductivity. The converging topology augments the convective effects as the vapor quality decreases along the condenser flow length. The outcome is a condenser with improved heat transfer performance. This study focuses on the thermal and hydraulic performance of two 3D-printed wick flow condensers made of GRCop-42, a high-thermal-conductivity copper alloy, and 17-4 PH, a stainless-steel alloy known for its superior corrosion resistance. Experiments were conducted over a range of dielectric mass flow rates ($0.1-1.1 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{s}$) while subcooling was fixed at $\\boldsymbol{-} \\mathbf{5 . 5 ^ { \\circ }} \\mathbf{C}$ to evaluate heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics. The GRCop-42 wick flow condenser exhibited significantly better heat transfer performance, achieving a heat flux of $24 \\mathrm{~kW} / \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\left(2.4 \\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\right)$ and a heat transfer coefficient (HTC) of $4.2 \\mathrm{~kW} / \\mathrm{m}^{2}-\\mathrm{K}$ at a mass flow rate of $0.6 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{s}$ and $1.1 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{s}$, respectively-$300 \\%$ and $250 \\%$ higher than the 17-4 PH wick structure. These enhancements are attributed to the superior thermal conductivity of GRCop-42 ($\\sim 350 \\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{m}-\\mathrm{K}$) compared to $17-4 \\mathrm{PH}(\\sim 15 \\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{m}-\\mathrm{K})$. Complete condensation with near-zero exit vapor quality was achieved with GRCop-42 across all flow rates, whereas the 17-4 PH wick exhibited increasing vapor exit quality (0 to 0.7) as the mass flow rate increased from 0.1 to $0.7 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{s}$. The higher thermal performance of GRCop-42 came with an increased pressure drop penalty, rising to 17 kPa at $0.6 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{s}$, compared to 8 kPa for 17-4 PH. These results underscore the trade-off between thermal performance and pressure drop for GRCop-42 and highlight the potential of $17-4 \\mathrm{PH}$ as a corrosion-resistant alternative for applications requiring moderate thermal performance. This work offers critical insights into the design and material selection of advanced 3D-printed wick condensers for demanding thermal management applications."

The proposed cooling system focuses on addressing thermal hotspots and ensuring uniform temperature distribution, challenges often encountered with conventional cooling technologies such as traditional microchannel liquid cold plates. Three-dimensional numerical investigations were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the MJILCP for a thermal design power (TDP) of 1000 W. Its performance was compared with a skived-fin-channel liquid cold plate (SFCLCP). The liquid coolant used in the study is PG25 at an inlet temperature of $25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, with a volumetric flow rate ranging from 0.75 to 2 LPM. The results demonstrated that the MJILCP significantly enhances thermal performance while reducing the pumping power requirement compared to the SFCLCP. The proposed MJILCP can achieve a maximum reduction in thermal resistance of 14.3% and a decrease in pumping power by 19.3% relative to the SFCLCP. Notably, to attain a thermal resistance of $0.0236{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} / \\mathrm{W}$, the MJILCP requires 48% less pumping power than the SFCLCP. The MJILCP exhibits maximum chip temperatures of $61.72^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and $45.26^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ at flow rates of 0.75 and 2 LPM, respectively. This innovative design paves the way for more efficient thermal management solutions in the electronics industry, meeting the increasing demand for highperformance cooling systems in data centers, power electronics, and telecommunications equipment."

However, the visibility and impact of these notices can vary based on the user’s geographical location. In our study, we introduce a novel automated visual detection technique to explore the enforcement of cookie notices. This methodology outperforms previous techniques that depend on manual observations or inspection of HTML/CSS elements. Our analysis of 70,390 web pages visited across five countries on different continents reveals geographical disparities in cookie notice visibility, with France exhibiting the highest prevalence at \\(69\\%\\) and Japan the lowest at \\(27\\%\\). This variation in visibility correlates with the state of cookies and tracking. In further examination of interaction with cookie notices, we analyze 351,950 web pages and find that third-party cookies increase when users interact with the notices, notably in the US. Conversely, France, with its stringent regulations, maintains the lowest number of third-party cookies. Tracking trends closely follow these patterns, highlighting a correlation between the visibility of cookie notices and user tracking. That correlation highlights the need for accurate detection of cookie notices in this domain, as we propose."

Therefore, this study introduces strategy-oriented demonstration videos as an intervention and investigates their differential effects on users with varying proficiency levels. A mixed 2 (proficiency: high/low) × 2 (intervention: video/no intervention) experiment was conducted on the Multi-Attribute Task Battery II multi-task platform, integrating electroencephalography features (including band power and brain network metrics), behavioral performance, and Task Load Index subjective workload into a multi-dimensional evaluation system. The results showed that (1) high-proficiency users outperformed low-proficiency users across all metrics, demonstrating more efficient electroencephalography features and lower subjective workload; (2) strategy-oriented videos significantly improved task performance, coordinated the optimization of multiple electroencephalography features, and reduced subjective workload for low-proficiency users; and (3) for high-proficiency users, the same video intervention elicited only isolated activation in EEG features without meaningful performance gains, reflecting a clear expertise reversal effect. These findings highlight the importance of tailoring Human-Computer Interaction training to user proficiency and provide neurocognitive evidence to support the design of personalized intervention strategies in complex interactive systems."

    "abstract": "Anti-money laundering (AML) refers to a global framework of laws, regulations, and protocols designed to trace and expose illicit funds that have been concealed to appear legitimate. Enforcing anti-money laundering measures demands rigorous monitoring of financial transactions to detect potentially unlawful activities. However, conventional rule-based AML systems, while compliant with regulatory standards, generate excessive false positives that burden analysts and obscure subtle laundering patterns. To address these limitations, advanced machine learning techniques, particularly those based on graph structures like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer a promising alternative. In this context, we introduce a novel method, referred to as AMLPD (Anti–Money Laundering with Personalized Diffusion), which utilizes Personalized PageRank and diffusion mechanisms to generate unsupervised node embeddings. This technique learns inductive graph embeddings for AML detection by taking into account the directionality of graph edges and incorporating both node and edge features, along with the graph’s structural information. AMLPD derives a node’s local representation by fusing diffusion processes with Personalized PageRank scores. This fusion captures critical information relevant to AML when transformed into a lower-dimensional embedding space. These embeddings are then used by a classifier to identify potential instances of money laundering. Our method is not only scalable to large datasets but also enables deeper analysis of the learned embeddings. Experimental results indicate that our method surpasses existing baseline models, particularly when positional encodings are integrated. A core objective of our work is to enhance the efficiency of AML investigations by offering AI-powered insights. As such, AMLPD demonstrates strong potential in improving the performance of GNN-based AML detection systems."

This paper proposes a latency-aware co-simulation platform integrating CarMaker and Vissim to evaluate safety and comfort under real-world vehicle-to-cloud (V2C) latency conditions. Three communication latency models, derived from empirical 5G measurements in China and Hungary, are incorporated and statistically modeled using Gamma distributions. A proactive conflict module (PCM) is proposed to dynamically control background vehicles and generate safety-critical scenarios. The platform is validated through experiments involving an exemplary system under test (SUT) across eight testing conditions combining two PCM modes (enabled/disabled) and four latency conditions (none, China, Hungary, abnormal). Safety and comfort are assessed using metrics including collision rate, distance headway, post-encroachment time, and the spectral characteristics of longitudinal acceleration. Results show that the PCM effectively increases driving environment criticality, while V2C latency reduces ride comfort and, under extreme driving conditions, further aggravates safety-critical scenarios. These findings confirm the platform’s effectiveness in systematically evaluating cloud-controlled ICVs under diverse testing conditions."

The receiver comprises a clock buffer, a quadrature clock corrector (QCC), a reconfigurable decision feedback equalizer (RDFE), a dual mode divider, and a bidirectional transition controller (BTC). The proposed reconfigurable receiver can select the sampling mode according to the speed of the input DQ. At high speeds, intersymbol interference removal can be done through equalization mode, which performs DFE using quadrature clocks. However, at low speeds, power consumption can be optimized via amplification mode, which simply amplifies input DQ using a half-rate clock with DFE turned off. The test chip was fabricated in a 28 nm CMOS process. The measurement results of the chip show an energy efficiency improvement to the DFE at 800 Mb/s by approximately 55%. Hence, energy efficiency improved from 2.13 pJ/b to 0.96 pJ/b for the proposed method."

    "abstract": "As a cost-effective and robust technology, automotive radar has seen steady improvement during the last years. Radio frequency (RF) images, serving as a radar data format with rich semantic information, have attracted considerable interest in radar object detection. Previous RF-based models heavily rely on convolutional neural networks, leading to the high computational cost. To solve this problem, we propose a model called Mask-RadarNet to fully utilize the hierarchical semantic features from the RF image sequences. Mask-RadarNet exploits the combination of interleaved convolution and attention operations in the encoder. In addition, patch shift is introduced to Mask-RadarNet for efficient spatial-temporal feature learning. By shifting part of patches with a specific mosaic pattern in the temporal dimension, Mask-RadarNet achieves competitive performance while reducing the computational burden of the spatial-temporal modeling. In order to capture the spatial-temporal semantic contextual information, we design the class masking attention module (CMAM) in our encoder. Moreover, a lightweight auxiliary decoder is added to our model to aggregate prior maps generated from the CMAM. Experiments on the CRUW dataset demonstrate that the proposed Mask-RadarNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with relatively lower computational complexity and fewer parameters."

    "abstract": "How to efficiently schedule the transmit beams and power resources in colocated multiple-input-multiple-output (C-MIMO) radar network to achieve better multi-target tracking (MTT) accuracy is a critical research issue. However, in electronic countermeasure environments, excessive resource allocation may lead to the interception of transmit pulses by hostile receivers. As the number of intercepted pulses increases, the transmit signals of C-MIMO radar nodes would be identified and subject to precise suppression jamming, resulting in a sharp degradation in MTT performance. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a low probability of identification (LPID)-based composed resource allocation (CRA) scheme for MTT in C-MIMO radar network. Closed-form expressions for the predicted conditional Cramér-Rao lower bound (PC-CRLB) and the radar signal identification probability under suppression jamming are derived. Based on the tactical significance map (TSM) function, we compute the comprehensive threat level for each target in real time. We then employ the sum of products between PC-CRLB values and threat levels, and the worst-case identification probability as the quantitative metrics for MTT performance and LPID performance, respectively. The LPID-CRA is developed to jointly balance these two metrics by dynamically allocating beam-pairing and power resources within each tracking frame. To address the resulting non-convex non-linear problem, we perform an equivalent transformation of the optimization model and develop an efficient five-stage solution method that incorporates the Zoutendijk methods of feasible directions (ZMFD) and the min-cost flow algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LPID-CRA strategy significantly enhances overall system performance."

We assume that the receiver is equipped with an adaptive antenna array with general array configuration, comprising of a primary array with high–gain antennas and a reference array with low–gain antennas. It has been shown that this reference array structure can benefit interference suppression. Since it is difficult to derive the uniformly most powerful detector for the detection problem, we resort to using the Wald test and generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) schemes to design the detectors. Analytical performance of the proposed Wald test and GLRT is derived, indicating that the proposed two detectors bear constant false alarm rate property. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out, which verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis. Besides, it is revealed that the use of reference channel can facilitate to enhance the detection performance, but an increasing in the antenna number does not necessarily lead to an improvement in detection performance."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing image change detection (CD), as a pivotal technology for monitoring Earth’s surface dynamics, plays a crucial role in urban planning, resource management, and disaster assessment. Despite the success of deep learning-based methods, they still suffer from two significant limitations. Firstly, the inadequate exploitation of frequency-domain information restricts their ability to capture subtle structural and edge changes. Secondly, the suboptimal interaction strategies that predominantly rely on attention mechanisms or direct feature exchange that fails to fully model complex semantic differences between bi-temporal images. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Attention-based Group Interaction Network (WAGINet), which leverages wavelet attention for joint frequency-spatial domain feature learning and uses a group-wise feature exchange mechanism to optimize bi-temporal interaction. The wavelet attention module decomposes features into high-low frequency components and emphasize important ones to improve edge-aware feature extraction. In the meanwhile, the group interaction strategy enables both channel-group and spatial-group feature exchange to capture the correlation between bi-temporal features while better protecting structural integrity, so that promotes more discriminative change representation. Experimental results on public LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD datasets show that WAGINet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, providing an effective solution for high-precision remote sensing image CD in complex scenarios.

    "abstract": "Reliability of electronic components in the automotive, aerospace, and oil & gas industries, among others, becomes very critical due to the prevailing harsh operating conditions. In these extreme temperatures, from $-65^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to $200^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, high strain rates up to $\\mathbf{1 - 1 0 0}$ sec-1 may be experienced under exposure to shock and vibration. In such conditions, the weakest link is considered to be the solder joints in electronic assemblies. Long-term high-temperature exposure has turned the degradation of solder joints into a serious concern, which in turn has inspired the addition of active dopants to SAC solders to enhance their mechanical and lifetime properties. The emphasis of this work is on how active dopants such as bismuth can improve the performance of solder alloys like SAC-Q, SAC-R, and M758 to face up to increasingly severe application environments. The present study will deal with the detailed investigations of unaged and aged SAC305, SAC-Q, and M758 lead-free solders. This research focuses on the comprehensive testing of unaged and aged SAC305, SAC-Q, and M758 lead-free solders. Specifically, Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) and Elastic Modulus (E) were measured under varied strain rates of $\\mathbf{1 0}, \\mathbf{3 5}, \\mathbf{5 0}$, and $\\mathbf{7 5}$ per second, at temperatures ranging from $-65^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to $+200^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. The experimental data were used in the development of predictive models that correlate the content of Bismuth with mechanical properties and thermal degradation rates. These models allowed for the prediction of properties in SAC solders with higher Bi % content, e.g., SAC + 4% Bismuth. In addition, the parameters of the Anand Model have been computed for both tested and predicted solder alloys, allowing for detailed characterization of their viscoplastic behavior. In the most published literature, researchers have studied the PCB-Package assemblies under drop/shock using the older JEDEC std. JESD22B111 (2003) states the test board size to be $132 \\times 77 \\times 1.6 \\mathrm{~mm}$ (Krist et.al 2008, Krämer 2009, Cheng 2016). In this work, FEA simulations were conducted to model the drop events of the PCBCABGA208 assemblies by using the Input-G technique and the Anand viscoplasticity model. The assembly of the PCB Package is designed according to the latest JEDEC std. JESD22-B111A, which states the test board size to be $77 \\times 77 \\times 1 \\mathrm{~mm}$. It is found that doped SAC solders with increased Bismuth content exhibit enhanced mechanical properties and improved resistance against thermal degradation."

    "abstract": "Capillary-driven boiling using the microporous structures exhibits an exceptional two-phase heat transfer performance due to the presence of numerous nucleation sites and effective liquid-vapor separation. In addition, the high capillary pressure due to the small pore size enables passive liquid supply. Therefore, capillary-driven boiling is a promising candidate for energy-efficient microcoolers in high-heat-flux electronics. However, achieving area scalability is challenging due to significant viscous pressure losses along the wick, which hinder liquid transport across the boiling region. This limitation poses a major obstacle to contemporary large-area, high-performance chip cooling solutions and requires the development of the area-scalable capillary-driven two-phase cooler. In the present study, we have significantly improved the performance and expanded the cooling area of a capillary-driven micro-cooler with the augmented microporous layers over “sparse” and “dense” micro pin arrays to improve the two-phase heat transfer coefficient in conjunction with a capillary-based silicon open microchannel manifold (channel spacing of $\\mathbf{5 7 0, 1 1 4 0}$ and $\\mathbf{1 7 1 0 ~} \\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\mathbf{m}$), for efficient liquid delivery and vapor extraction, targeting exit vapor quality, $x_{\\mathrm{e}} \\approx 1$. Infrared thermography is employed to characterize the spatial temperature distribution and to understand the underlying heat and mass transfer mechanism. To extract the contribution of the two-phase heat transfer from the applied heat flux, the flow rate at the drainages in the test vehicle is measured to estimate the boiling rate at the critical heat flux level. We demonstrated critical heat flux level $\\approx 200 \\mathrm{Wcm}^{-2}$ and a superheat of $\\approx 4^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, achieving heat transfer coefficient $\\approx 430 \\mathrm{kWm}^{-20} \\mathrm{C}^{-1}$ and $x_{\\mathrm{e}} \\approx 1$ with minimum inlet flow rates of $5 \\mathrm{~g}^{(\\mathrm{min})^{-1}}$. Even a higher CHF level of $\\approx 450 \\mathrm{Wcm}^{-2}$ with superheat $\\approx 7^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, is achieved using inlet flow rate of $15 \\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{m i n})^{-1}$ but with $x_{e} \\approx 0.65$. The 3D manifold with microchannels spacing of $1140 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ provided the right balance of efficient liquid delivery for capillary wicking and open pathways for vapor extraction, showing the highest critical heat flux, given the same supplied flow rate. The two-phase cooler assisted by capillary-driven boiling in the previous studies typically supplied liquid across the perimeter of the wick, limiting their scalability and performance. The integration of a silicon microchannel manifold with a copper inverse opal porous layer overcomes these limitations by enhancing liquid flow distribution and preventing local dryout, enabling efficient two-phase heat transfer over larger areas. Therefore, the two-phase cooling scheme in this study demonstrates large-area capillary-driven boiling without compromising high heat transfer efficiency, making it a promising solution for contemporary high-performance chip cooling."

This paper presents a hybrid machine learning framework that integrates Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for sequential behavioral analysis with XGBoost for classification, specifically designed for highly imbalanced transactional data. A key innovation is the incorporation of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, which provide both global and local interpretability of model predictions, addressing the black-box nature of conventional machine learning systems. Experimental validation on a real-world digital banking dataset demonstrates significant performance improvements, with our model achieving an F1-score of 0.83 and recall of 0.82, substantially outperforming baseline approaches. SHAP-based interpretation reveals that HMM-derived features— particularly transaction sequence entropy and log-likelihood scores—serve as pivotal indicators of fraudulent activity.

However, traditional approaches face challenges, such as phonetic confusion across languages and poor robustness in natural multilingual conversations. Hence, this research proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled MSR framework based on Waveform to Vector, version 2.0, with Cross-Lingual Speech Representation (Wav2Vec 2.0 -XLSR53) with real CodeSwitching (CS) training data to capture spontaneous language mixing more accurately. The gathered data were then preprocessed using silence trimming, normalization, and segmentation to standardize the input quality. This was followed by embedding generation by the Language-agnostic Bert Sentence Embedding (LaBSE) model in which every sentence pair over several languages was designed based on cosine similarity scores. After that, preprocessing was used to fine-tune the Wav2Vec 2.0 -XLSR53 model for efficient alignment among audio and transcripts. Finally, the proposed framework attained an enhanced Word Error Rate (WER), mainly in midsentence code-switching scenarios, which allowed accurate transcription for cognitive voice interfaces. Experimental calculations on Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian show that the proposed AI-MSRWav2Vec2-XLSR-CS system improves the WER by 12-15% under high-similarity conditions, significantly outperforming baselines trained solely on synthetic bilingual data."

    "abstract": "The greater digitalization of smart grid infrastructure offers opportunities to innovate, while simultaneously providing the potential to face severe cybersecurity challenges. In avoiding this issue, a proper risk assessment methodology is needed to provide a solution that will provide a proper balance between the advancements of technologies and the corresponding threats to the associated security. In this paper, a MCDM-based risk assessment system is provided that evaluates threats and can reduce the threats of smart grids. It integrates AHP, TOPSIS, and ELECTRE to properly consider various factors of threats, plan priority measures of security, and improve the decision-making approach to the best possible extent. The suggested approach actually offers the opportunity to the stakeholders to compromise between the security aspect and the advancements by analyzing the threats of cybersecurity threats, operational expenditures, and the advancements of technologies. It is demonstrated that a multi-criteria risk analysis increases the stability and effectiveness of the decision-making approach. Therefore, the suggested approach is needed to manage the smart grid security."

    "abstract": "In-mold electronics (IME) technology offers significant advantages in design flexibility and functionality for automotive applications, but ensuring the reliability of circuits after thermoforming and prolonged high-temperature exposure remains a challenge. This study addresses this challenge by evaluating the performance and durability of screen-printed circuits on polycarbonate (PC) substrates. Conductive traces and operational amplifier circuits will be screen-printed and assembled with surface-mount devices using a thermoformable conductive adhesive. The samples will undergo thermoforming to replicate the mechanical deformation typical of automotive components, followed by High-Temperature Operating Life (HTOL) testing at $\\mathbf{8 5}^{\\boldsymbol{\\circ}} \\mathbf{C}$ for $\\mathbf{1, 0 0 0}$ hours following the AEC-Q100 Grade 3 standard. Electrical performance will be assessed before and after thermoforming and throughout thermal testing, while failure analysis will identify key degradation mechanisms. The results are expected to demonstrate that screen-printed IME circuits on PC substrates can withstand mechanical and thermal stresses, paving the way for their reliable integration into innovative and complex automotive components."

In recent times, there has been a lot of focus on accurate identification of heart beats. Feature extraction is the process of measuring specific features or properties. It is to reduce the specified original data and recognize one input pattern from another. The feature vector is generated by wavelet transform and statistical calculations. The Daubechies db4, db6, db16, symlet for discrete wavelet transform and morlet for continuous wavelet transform are used to compare the wavelet coefficients and their accuracies in this study. The proposed model combines band pass filter and normalization in preprocessing, wavelet transform for feature extraction, and a classifier model with CNN attention. This study utilizes the MIT-BIH dataset (48 half-hour recordings sampled at 360Hz). Compared to alternative wavelets, this feature extraction of db16 wavelet approach provides higher accuracy, enabling the model to reach 97% classification performance. The issue of dataset imbalance is managed by incorporating balanced class weights. Additionally, the wavelet with CNN used for comparative analysis is presented."

    "abstract": "Per-polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as forever chemicals, have uniquely useful characteristics that have made them ubiquitous in their use for industrial, commercial, and electronics applications, but there are several epidemiological studies linked to severe health effects such as liver diseases and thyroid malfunctions to these PFAS chemicals. A unified approach must be taken to remove these chemicals from electronic applications so that there is a minimum amount of waste generated by PFAS chemicals. Our solution is to show that non-PFAS materials have the same reliability in the end-use environment as in the case of PFAS so that the industry moves away from PFAS materials. In this study, we aim to show the interface between nonPFAS Underfills/Substrate and non-PFAS TIM/Cu have similar degradation properties when subjected to high temperature and humidity end-use conditions. The current state of the art shows there is a huge lack of literature in non-PFAS underfills. Most literature includes PFAS underfill reliability based on the material evolution of amine-based epoxies and a combination of interface mechanics developed from amine-based underfills and substrates. There are no long-term reliability studies conducted on non-PFAS underfills, and the degradation phenomena of non-PFAS underfill. Research presented in this paper includes (1) the development of non-PFAS interface samples between Underfills and Substrates, (2) test the UF/Substrate samples at $60 \\mathrm{RH} / 60 \\mathrm{C}$ and 85 R.H/85 C condition (3) develop non-PFAS interface sample for TIM/Cu substrate, (4) Arrhenius and peck model for accelerated factors (5) evaluate CZM parameters for interfaces (6) evaluate FTIR spectroscopy results for bulk TIMs. In addition, the evolution of mode-1 and mode-2 stress intensity factors is presented for non-PFAS underfills. Activation energy is calculated for the evolution of non-PFAS underfills in addition to the acceleration factors for temperature-humidity exposure."

Traditionally, research on digital twins has emphasized semantic and technical interoperability, often overlooking the critical aspect of how human users interact with systems. This paper explores how digital twin systems can enhance emergency response by delivering relevant information at the right time. The research focuses on large-scale evacuation strategies, particularly for university campuses, and examines how static and dynamic data about buildings and the environment can be better organized and communicated. By shifting the focus from \"system-to-system\" to \"person-to-system\" interoperability, the study proposes a framework based on Levels of Information Systems Interoperability (LISI) and autonomy levels of digital twins. It introduces the \"APAR\" criteria—amount, priority, accuracy, and reuse—for assessing data needs during emergencies, aiming to improve decision-making and information delivery to the first responders."

This topology eliminates the connection to the DC-link midpoint by using a coupling capacitor to block the DC component introduced by the new configuration. As a result, the voltage established across the capacitor, especially under inductive load conditions, allows for a reduction in the DC-link voltage compared to other topologies already presented in literature. The proposed control scheme ensures a stable load voltage, unity power factor operation at the grid side, and regulation of the DC-link voltage under voltage sags and swells. Preliminary simulation and experimental results are provided in order to validate the performance and feasibility of the proposed topology."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of electronic health systems has significantly transformed healthcare by digitizing patient records into Electronic Health Records (EHRs), thereby improving clinical efficiency, accessibility, and real-time disease monitoring. Despite these advancements, existing health record exchange systems face persistent challenges, including privacy breaches, limited interoperability, high storage overhead, and scalability constraints. Addressing these issues requires a comprehensive solution that ensures both robust security and seamless data sharing across healthcare environments. This study introduces a blockchain-enabled, privacy-preserving framework that integrates advanced cryptographic methods such as ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE), federated learning, and a hybrid blockchain architecture. The design emphasizes fine-grained, patient-centric access control, safeguarding sensitive health information while employing smart contracts for automated policy enforcement and compliance monitoring. To validate its effectiveness, comparative analyses were conducted against state-of-the-art models, including lightweight encryption with federated learning, Blowfish-based blockchain, IPFS-enabled HealthRecChain, and homomorphic encryption techniques. Performance evaluation covered twelve key parameters, including privacy preservation, scalability, latency, computational efficiency, encryption speed, storage utilization, interoperability, and auditability. Experimental results show that the proposed framework delivers superior outcomes, achieving 96% data privacy, supporting up to 1200 transactions per second (TPS), reducing latency to 180 ms, and providing enhanced brute-force resistance with a score of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$9.5 / 10$</tex>. Additionally, it demonstrated improved efficiency in encryption/decryption, key management, and secure data exchange across heterogeneous systems. In conclusion, the framework offers a scalable, secure, and ethically aligned solution for health record exchange. By balancing decentralization, high performance, and patientcentered governance, it lays a strong foundation for nextgeneration smart healthcare ecosystems."

Key sizing criteria reported in the literature are summarized, and both passive and active damping methods are evaluated in terms of total harmonic distortion (THD), losses, and implementation complexity. The analysis highlights promising trade-offs, identifying two passive damping topologies with reduced losses as superior, alongside the virtual-resistor active damping as a highly effective control-based technique.

Details of switching mechanisms are suppliers’ proprietary, but most are selected to cover advanced device technologies commonly known as MicroelectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) or opto-electrical. Switching of the light occurs by mechanical movement of the mirror or electro-optical mechanism to route laser light to a selected channel. For high-reliability space applications, it is critical to determine reliability of these devices, especially under vacuum and vibration as well as to characterize their failure mechanisms for better definition of risk for a mission. All the switches were characterized before and after each environmental test for performance and comparison. The sequential approach started with the performance characterization at temperatures in vacuum since the outgassing could affect reflectivity of the mirror and degrades output power. After initial characterization, it followed with 6 thermal vacuum cycles, started at the lowest functional temperature ranges and were increased to their maximum operation temperature $\\left(-5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} / 70^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\right)$. The three devices were then subjected to vibration level of 9.8 Grms for 4 minutes to establish the level of robustness. The sequential steps allowed to not only establish the mission requirement steps, e.g. launch (vibration), and use (thermal vacuum), but it also established the cycling and vibration synergism on time to failures if Miner’s rule applies and to determine interaction of failure mechanisms. The performance tests were followed with X-ray inspection to verify its integrity condition as well as to determine the internal build configuration. The test data with detailed procedure of test results are presented. Detailed failure analyses with failure mechanisms are also presented."

In this study, we examined the influence of a visual cue and the user engagement type (manual action vs. passive observation) on the ventriloquism effect. Our results showed that the presence of the projected extended hand significantly enhanced the ventriloquism effect, whereas manual action did not affect its strength compared to passive observation, which contrasts with previous findings."

By employing pyrrole (Py) as a functional monomer in vapor form, our technique circumvents the limitations of conventional liquid-phase deposition—such as uneven film growth and pore blockage—thereby ensuring uniform coating and preserving the integrity of sensitive template molecules. The innovative process yields a polypyrrole (PPy)-based MIP with high specificity and sensitivity, as demonstrated by its application in a nanostructured porous silicon optical transducer for the in vitro detection of human hemoglobin (HHb). This sensor not only exhibits remarkable reliability and reusability over a one-month period in human plasma but also paves the way for integration into advanced, miniaturized diagnostic platforms. Moreover, we are extending our approach to functionalize novel bioresorbable transducers based on PLGA-embedded nanostructured PSiO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>.

This work is based on DUCK-U-Net, which is the fusion of DUCK-Net and the traditional U-Net and offers good performance on the multi-class brain tumor segmentation database. e. The proposed DUCK-U-Net architecture has been shown to outperform conventional models such as U-Net, U-Net with Inception blocks, and U-Net with ResNet blocks, having a Dice Score of 0.74, IoU Score of 0.61, Sensitivity of 0.85, and Specificity of 0.98. Furthermore, the DUCK-U-Net model reports reduced computational time compared to other popular networks. The proposed DUCK-U-Net reports accurate and efficient brain tumor segmentation. Therefore, this model could be employed for real-time clinical applications soon. An application is also being proposed based on this study."

This study presents the implementation of Finite Set Model Predictive Control (FCS-MPC), an advanced nonlinear technique, combined with Shunt Active Power Filters (SAPF) and three-level Neutral Point Clamped (NPC) converters, in order to optimise power quality in a three-phase network.

    "abstract": "To enhance renewable energy accommodation capacity and achieve coordinated optimization of low-carbon and economic performance in energy systems, this paper proposes a regional integrated energy system (RIES) optimal dispatch model incorporating stepwise carbon trading, green certificate trading (GCT), and integrated demand response. First, operational models for multi-form energy conversion, including electricity, gas, cooling, and heat, are established. Subsequently, mechanisms for stepwise carbon trading and green certificate trading are analyzed, along with demand-side response strategies that enable peak-shaving and valley-filling operations for electrical, thermal, and cooling loads. Taking daily total cost minimization as the objective function, five different scenarios are analyzed through mixed-integer linear programming using the CPLEX solver. Case study results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively constrains carbon emission intensity, reduces system peak-valley differences, and decreases operational costs. This validation confirms the model’s effectiveness in achieving dual objectives of low-carbon operation and economic optimization."

Interviewees facing challenges during the job application process, especially those with high anxiety, can benefit from VR-based training platforms that simulate interview scenarios. We investigated the integration of VR avatar design and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in the context of annual performance reviews (APR). The study evaluated user experiences across three APR settings: a face-to-face APR without VR, a realistic AI-enabled avatar in a VR environment, and a stylised AI-enabled avatar in a VR environment. The VR avatars were connected to a GAI system, which facilitated audio-based interactions during the APR process.A within-subject experiment involving 20 participants compared these settings through questionnaires, assessing system usability, sense of presence, ease of self-disclosure, intimacy, stress levels and acceptance of opinions. The results showed that in-person APR was preferred for self-disclosure, intimacy, and acceptance of opinions during the performance evaluation. VR APRs with realistic and stylised avatars received positive usability feedback and were favoured for reducing stress and pressure. Participants provided qualitative feedback emphasising the need to improve the VR avatars’ responses, facial expressions, and eye contact.The findings suggest that VR APR systems hold promise as an alternative or complementary approach to traditional methods, offering potential benefits such as reducing stress for employees during performance evaluations."

To this end, an optimal planning method for stand-alone microgrid with hydrogen storage based on information gap decision theory is proposed. Firstly, construct the basic structure of stand-alone microgrid with hydrogen energy storage, based on which the basic working principle of hydrogen storage system is explained and its simplified mathematical model is established; Secondly, a two-layer optimal planning model of the stand-alone microgrid with incentive-based demand response is established, in which the outer model minimizes the annual value of the integrated cost of the microgrid as the optimization objective, while the inner model introduces the information gap decision theory to simulate the uncertain parameters and minimizes the annual operating cost of the microgrid as the optimization objective; Finally, a genetic algorithm with embedded mixed integer linear programming is used to solve the two-layer optimal planning model. The algorithm results verify the rationality and validity of the proposed model and provide a reference for the optimization planning of stand-alone microgrid containing hydrogen energy storage."

    "abstract": "Concrete Compressive Strength (CCS) prediction is crucial for construction design. quality control, and safety of civil engineering structures. Conventional laboratory testing is also time-consuming, expensive, and destructive in nature, making these methods not ideal for today's construction, which requires the fastest methods to be more efficient. Machine learning (ML) has become a valid replacement but has a delicate hyperparameter tuning process that will often lead to poor generalization across datasets. Bi-Long Term Short Memory (Bi directional LTSM) can model complicated nonlinear relationships between the Bearing Capacity of Reinforced Concrete Beams and strength; however, performance and accuracy heavily depend on hyperparameter tuning. This research presents a Beluga Whale Optimization-Bi-LSTM (BWO-LSTM) modelling framework for predicting Bearing Capacity of Reinforced Concrete Beams that will maintain hyperparameter tuning, and, thus, incorporate a secondary efficiency gain in preparation time. This paper employed BWO and systematically tune needed hyperparameters of the mixed model Bi-LSTM, where BWO is realized through systematic exploration of the hyperparameter search space. The proposed unified learning model was trained and validated using 2 benchmark datasets (Kaggle Concrete Compressive Strength dataset, UCI Concrete Compressive Strength dataset) that also included a variety of mix proportions and curing ages. Experimental results demonstrate that the BWO-LSTM model outperforms conventional ML models and manually tuned Bi-LSTM, achieving higher prediction accuracy of 97.6 %. This study highlights the potential of hybrid optimization-learning frameworks in Prediction of Bearing Capacity of Reinforced Concrete Beams."

We systematically analyze how variations in the number of intents, the number and linguistic diversity of patterns per intent, and the semantic similarity between intents affect model performance. Evaluation metrics accuracy, F1-score and intent-wise confusion matrix provides a granular understanding of model behavior. Our findings reveal that while transformer-based models generally outperform others in accuracy and generalization, simpler models perform competitively when intents are well-separated and patterns are sufficiently varied.

    "abstract": "Financial Technology (FinTech) innovations are revolutionizing the way financial services are delivered, enabling more efficient, personalized, and data-driven solutions. These services encompass lending, payments, wealth management, and risk assessment, transforming traditional financial ecosystems. Among these, credit management remains a critical function, aiming to balance customer needs with financial institution risk exposure. However, existing credit management systems often suffer from limited adaptability, insufficient use of behavioral data, and challenges in accurately predicting default risk, leading to suboptimal credit decisions. This paper proposes a novel hybrid framework that combines Random Forest (RF)-based feature selection with a Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning (RL) model to enhance credit risk prediction and optimize credit limit allocation. The approach leverages key demographic and transactional features to accurately classify default risk, while the RL agent dynamically learns credit adjustment policies that maximize long-term rewards. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance in default prediction, achieving an AUC of 0.90, and effective credit limit optimization with stable cumulative rewards."

Genre theory currently encompasses more than just text analysis; it also contains insights from context and professionals. ESP and Business Communication studies have come together, which supports this change. This trend is also happening because businesses are using new media and because schools need to teach students how to communicate in the workplace. A hybrid neural network model based on GRU-CNN estimates how much business English will be used to deal with these developments. There are three processes in the model: preprocessing the data, extracting features using term weights, TDF, and GR, and training the model. GRU layers find features that change over time, whereas CNN layers find features that are in space. To test the model, it had to split the dataset into two parts: training and testing. The GRU-CNN model did better than other deep learning methods in tests, with a prediction accuracy of 96.56 %. This study suggests that the model can make English in Business Communication classes better by connecting theory to practice."

The study aims to analyze the competitiveness of Ukrainian regions by developing a multidimensional ranking system based on a set of twelve economic and social indicators. A comparison of the integral indicators of regional competitiveness in Ukraine for the years 2012 (the year before the Revolution of Dignity and the war), 2021 (the year before the full-scale war), and 2023 (the most recent year for which some regional statistical data are available) enables an evaluation of the war’s impact on regional competitiveness at different stages. The study results showed a significant disparity between regions that needs to be reduced. The integral indicators indicate that in both 2012 and 2021, Dnipropetrovsk region was the leader, while in 2023, Lviv region exhibited the highest performance indicators. This shift is closely linked to the ongoing war in Ukraine, which has caused substantial losses across all regions."

    "abstract": "Flow boiling in mini and micro-channels is an efficient solution for meeting the high heat dissipation demands of advanced thermal management systems. However, accurately predicting heat transfer coefficients remains a significant challenge due to the complex fluid and thermal dynamics in these two-phase systems. Conventional approaches, including physicsbased correlations and theoretical models, often fall short in providing reliable predictions. Although machine learning (ML) offers a compelling alternative, its ‘black-box’ nature can lead to outcomes that may conflict with established physical principles. This study investigates hybrid physics-informed machine learning (PIML) algorithms, which integrate ML techniques with physical models. Three selected physical models for predicting heat transfer coefficients are combined with an artificial neural network (ANN) and trained using a comprehensive database. The database, consisting of 16,953 data points on flow boiling heat transfer in mini and micro-channels collected from 50 sources, is utilized for training and testing. The results indicate that PIML algorithms consistently achieve similar Mean Absolute Errors of $\\mathbf{7 \\%}-\\mathbf{8 \\%}$, outperforming physical models. Additionally, the PIML models demonstrate slightly better performance in predicting unseen data compared to the pure ANN models. Overall, the quality and diversity of the training dataset significantly influence the performance of both PIML and pure ANN models."

In response, the WHO declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, emphasizing the urgent need for rapid and precise detection of different Mpox virus (Mpox) clades. Early diagnosis, particularly through point-of-care molecular testing (POCT), is crucial for controlling its transmission. Here, we present the development of a colorimetric lateral flow assay detectable by the naked eye, utilizing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) capped with single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) to specifically identify and differentiate Mpox Clades I and II. The ssDNAs, functionalized with thiol groups and conjugated to AuNPs, selectively agglomerate in the presence of target Mpox DNA, inducing a shift in surface plasmon resonance. This optimized assay achieves a detection limit of 100 copies/μl across all clades and exhibits high specificity for Mpox, with no cross-reactivity to other pathogens. These assays hold great potential for clinical applications, enabling rapid and reliable viral detection."

    "abstract": "This paper presents reliability test results for an evaluation functional electronics assembly using highly accelerated life test (HALT) for rapid testing of Class P technologies. Ruggedization for vibration resistances were made based on understanding physics of failure (PoF) mechanisms of packages at assembly level. Class P, a nonhermetic plastic encapsulated microcircuit (PEM), was recently introduced into Mil-PRF-38535, Rev M. An evaluation board was selected to have numerous advanced PEM packaging technologies. It had a Flip-Chip Ball Grid Array (FCBGA), a few Fine Pitch BGAs (FPBGAs), a few Quad Flat No-Leads (QFNs), and passives. The New HALT with PoF follows conventional methods, but with different philosophy. It uses mature electronics hardware and mitigation methods at assembly level. It allows avoidance of early failures, especially those latent defects only detectable under simultaneous thermal cycling and vibration. The following steps were implemented on the evaluation board and the test results are presented in detail. First, it established cold/hot temperature limits using a stepwise approach. Second, it established survivability under TCs with increasing the cycling ranges, first, 100 cycles in the range of $-30^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to $70^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and then additional 100 cycles in the range of $-40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to $85^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. Third, removed fan and heat sink from FCBGA in preparation for ruggedization. Ruggedization approaches including FCBGA corner filling and bonding the heat sink are discussed. Finally, first, established vibration limit from 5 to 50 Grms, then, performed simultaneous vibration at 25 Grms with thermal cycling in the range of $-40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to $85^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. The paper presents detailed results for each step including temperature at which soft failures occurred during cold/hot evaluation for limits, results of inspection by X-ray to determine package types, and define ruggedization methods for vibration resistance improvement using corner staking, corner filling, and underfilling for FCBGAs and FPBGAs."

Traditional cooling methods, such as active air cooling and liquid-based systems, vary in effectiveness, with liquid systems generally offering superior heat dissipation due to their higher heat transfer properties. However, these systems can be complex and add weight. An emerging alternative is immersion cooling, where battery cells are directly immersed in an electrically insulating fluid. This approach enables efficient heat transfer through direct contact and can also provide additional safety by acting as a thermal barrier if the fluid is low in flammability. The effectiveness of immersion cooling depends on fluid properties such as viscosity, thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and flammability, as well as key system parameters like fluid circulation, flow rate, and geometry. This study focuses on designing an experimental setup to explore immersion cooling for battery modules, with the goal of developing optimized cooling fluids and evaluating key performance factors such as heat transfer efficiency. Experimental results highlight the importance of fluid flow rate, power dissipation, fluid type, and system configuration in enhancing cooling performance."

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women globally, and the most prevalent cancer type in Malaysia, thus highlighting the need for novel treatment options. Traditional 2D cell culture models fail to replicate the complex in vivo environment, whereas 3D cell cultures provide better cell-cell and cell-environment interactions. However, current 3D tumour models are limited to small sizes of a few microns. This study aims to design and 3D print a cellular scaffold capable of successful cell attachment and growth using GelMa hydrogel with lithium phenyl (2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl) phosphinate (LAP) photoinitiator. GelMa is cured using blue light of 405 nm wavelength via the vat photopolymerization process. Different LAP concentrations (0.5 %, 0.2 %, 0.1 % and 0.05 % w/v GelMa) and light exposure times (10–100 s) are tested, and scaffold designs included cubic and triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) structures, generated using MATLAB and Autodesk Netfabb. The printed scaffolds are sterilized, cultured with breast cancer cells, and monitored for cell attachment and growth over 1–2 weeks. By the end of the study, the optimal LAP concentration and exposure time for scaffold integrity are identified, and the effects of TPMS scaffold designs on cancer cell behaviour are compared to traditional cubic scaffolds. This research will advance cancer studies by improving tumour models and enabling better drug response analysis."

However, these simulations require developers to predefine each visual effect, limiting flexibility. We present ShadAR, an AR application enabling real-time transformation of visual perception through shader generation using large language models (LLMs). ShadAR allows users to express their visual intent via natural language, which is interpreted by an LLM to generate corresponding shader code. This shader is then compiled real-time to modify the AR headset’s viewport. We present our LLM-driven shader generation pipeline and demonstrate its ability to transform visual perception for inclusiveness and creativity."

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) integrates into extended reality (XR), or known as XR×AI, a central design challenge emerges: how to balance AI assistance with user autonomy. This challenge presents a core dilemma: unassisted interfaces risk creating \"hollow autonomy,\" where overwhelming choice undermines user confidence, while fully automated systems can impose a \"tyranny of efficiency\" that erodes agency. To investigate this tension, we conducted a study with 32 participants, comparing four distinct XR×AI strategies along a spectrum of intervention, from passive information display to direct recommendation, across two levels of task complexity. Our findings reveal a clear user preference for a collaborative middle ground that avoids the pitfalls of the extremes. While high intervention was decisively rejected for undermining agency, minimal support proved ineffective under complexity, leading to high cognitive load and low confidence. The most successful interfaces were those that acted as a \"cognitive scaffold,\" collaborative partners that curated the decision space to reduce cognitive load and prevent errors, while leaving the final, empowering act of choice to the user. These results demonstrate that the goal of XR×AI design is not to create a system that thinks for us, but a partner that helps us think better."

    "abstract": "Global warming is an undeniable reality, necessitating innovative solutions to enhance thermal comfort while minimizing environmental impact, and avoiding the rapid reliance on fossil fuel based approaches. This research specifically addresses the challenge of improving thermal comfort at bus stops in Egypt’s arid climate, where high temperatures, intense solar radiation, and wind cause significant discomfort for passengers waiting for public transportation. The study focuses on implementing passive design strategies, including shading devices and ventilation techniques, tailored to the region’s wind patterns and solar conditions. Additionally, this research introduces a novel, sustainable composite material made from sugarcane bagasse and epoxy resin, which is lightweight and has low thermal conductivity, for use in the roofs and walls of bus stop structures. Louvers are constructed from wood, while aluminium is utilized for seating and the main structural components. Using Ladybug software, computer simulations were conducted to compare two new design prototypes with the current bus stop design, considering different street orientations. The findings reveal that the Universal Climate Index (UTCI) for the current design for a big portion of the year lies between 35oC and 40oC. While the UTCI ranges between 28°C-30°C and 26°C-34°C for the first and second prototype respectively. Thermal comfort improved to 80% with the proposed designs, in contrast to just 37% for the conventional existing bus stop, while stress levels throughout the year decreased from 50% to 6%. These results offer practical insights for improving bus stop thermal comfort and help promote sustainable public transportation in Egypt."

Their nature and boundary conditions require a robust requirements engineering approach to handle diverse stakeholder groups, regulatory constraints, and organizational needs. Digital transformation projects are complex to manage and introduce significant challenges, particularly in requirements engineering. A common challenge is that customers and developers often use different terminology, which can lead misunderstandings. A case study was conducted within a department of a public hospital in Germany to identify the key RE challenges experienced in healthcare digital transformation projects. Some common issues were the lack of standardized processes, clear documentation, and stakeholder engagement. The article contributes to the research in the field of digital transformation by revealing challenges that practitioners face during the requirements engineering process.

    "abstract": "The joint classification of hyperspectral images (HSI) and LiDAR data is an important research direction in the field of remote sensing image processing. However, existing methods are mostly limited to inadequate feature extraction or simple serial fusion strategies, failing to fully exploit the deep cross-modal relationships between LiDAR and HSI data. Meanwhile, global modeling based on Transformers, despite capturing long-range dependencies, faces difficulties in handling high-dimensional remote sensing data due to quadratic computational complexity, leading to constrained global-local feature collaboration. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel hierarchical multi-scale Mamba network (HMMamba) for joint classification of HSI and LiDAR data. First, the method adopts a hierarchical design to obtain rich multi-level feature representations through multi-scale feature extraction. Second, it utilizes adaptive weight allocation to achieve dynamic cross-modal feature integration. Finally, it constructs a Fused Feature enhancement Mamba Block (FFMB), which integrates a dual-branch attention mechanism and selective state space modeling to achieve efficient global context modeling under linear computational complexity Extensive experiments on four public datasets (Houston2013, MUUFL, Trento, and Augsburg) demonstrate that HMMamba significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification performance. Specifically, on Augsburg dataset, the OA improvement is 3.24% compared to the suboptimal method, fully validating the superior performance of the proposed method.

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting pCR to neoadjuvant chemo-therapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients is crucial for achieving personalized treatment strategies. pCR is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer in the breast. To this end, we propose a dual-path GCN–Transformer network (DGT-Net) to integrate ultrasound and pathological image features for early pCR prediction. In the ultrasound pathway, DGT-Net constructed a multimodal knowledge graph to aggregate information on tumor macromorphology, blood perfusion patterns, and tissue elasticity. In the pathology pathway, DGT-Net extracted microhistological patterns and their spatial structures from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained pathological slides. By introducing an attention score–based dynamic key-patch selection method, a pathology graph is constructed to identify highly discriminative tissue regions. Both pathways employ Transformer encoders to capture complex relationships across modalities, and the outputs are fused through a weighted soft voting strategy to produce robust pCR prediction results. This study included data from 181 breast cancer patients, and experimental results show that DGT-Net outperforms several advanced models, achieving an AUC of 0.891 and an accuracy of 86.2%. Moreover, the diagnostic performance achieved by combining multimodal ultrasound and pathological image information exceeded that of using ultrasound alone (AUC: 0.880) or pathology alone (AUC: 0.786). DGT-Net provides a reliable, non-invasive method for early pCR prediction and has the potential to support clinical decision-making in NAC regimen design."

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) applications has driven advancements in networking technologies like Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) to extend coverage and enhance the lifespan of IoT devices (IoDs). However, real-world IoT networks are typically heterogeneous, comprising static and dynamic IoDs leading to variations in network topology. These fluctuations cause challenges like increased data latency and energy imbalances, which hinder efficient information flow. To overcome these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that integrates Small-World Characteristics (SWC), inspired by social network theory, into heterogeneous LPWANs using reinforcement learning. Specifically, the Q-learning technique is employed to introduce new long-range links into the network, enhancing connectivity and optimizing performance. Different conventional networks with varying numbers of mobile nodes are studied in this work followed by their subsequent transformation to small-world versions. The performance of the networks is optimized in terms of energy efficiency and latency in data routing. It is observed that, irrespective of the network (conventional or small-world), the performance is better if the number of static nodes is greater. Furthermore, independent of the degree of dynamicity, the SW-LPWAN is more energy efficient and has lower transmission delay than the corresponding conventional network. Numerically, SWLPWANs achieve up to 14.6% faster data transmission speeds, supporting 19.7% more active IoDs, and maintaining 15.5% higher residual energy compared to conventional networks."

The In-Out Core stator improves slot fill factor in small motors, enhances winding manufacturability, and reduces cogging torque. However, it introduces harmonic components in the induced voltage due to flux circulation around the slot region. To address this, a method was applied to increase air-gap flux density and saturate the slot opening region, making it electromagnetically behave as if no slot opening exists. Harmonic characteristics of surface-mounted permanent and interior permanent magnet rotor structures were analyzed, showing that both magnet thickness and sufficiently high remanent flux density are critical for harmonic suppression. As bonded magnets without heavy rare-earths limit remanence, a flux-concentrating spoke-type rotor was applied."

We present a novel fixed-point analysis of saturation throughput and average access delay of hybrid access that accounts for discrete rate adaptation, packet decoding errors, and scheduling. Using this analysis and Markov decision process (MDP) theory, we design a novel dynamic RU allocation policy (ODRAP) for hybrid access. Our analysis and policy design are the first to capture the dynamic flow of users between UORA and SA, and its dependence on the RU allocation. The existing literature has modeled UORA or SA, but not both, or has assumed a fixed number of SA users. We first develop the analysis when the number of packets reported in the buffer status report (BSR) of a user is a geometric random variable. We then present an iterative approach to handle application-specific general distributions. Our numerical results verify the accuracy of the analysis despite its simplicity. Furthermore, they highlight the impact of the number of allocated RUs on the scheduler. ODRAP optimally trades off the throughput with the access delay compared to several benchmark policies."

Furthermore, the method facilitates the detection of anomalies in resonator elements, which may result in shifts in resonant frequency or deviations in transmission zero positions. These deviations can lead to performance degradation, positioning the method as a valuable tool for fault diagnosis and reliability assessment in acoustic filter design."

    "abstract": "Cyberbullying has a significant impact on the many people who use social media, especially teenagers. Therefore, this study introduces a hybrid system that combines a support vector machine (SVM) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to detect cyberbullying on social networks, particularly on X (Twitter). The proposed model combines the deep contextual analysis capability of LSTM networks with the powerful classification performance of SVMs, using features extracted via the TF-IDF technique. A data set of English-language tweets was pre-processed and analyzed to train and consequently assess the hybrid system. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy and can effectively identify cyberbullying, even in subtle cases such as sarcasm. This study contributes to enhanced online safety by leveraging the strengths of both models in the hybrid framework, providing a scalable solution for real-time cyberbullying detection. Future recommendations include expanding the data set and exploring multi-modal approaches to improve the model’s detection capabilities."

    "abstract": "Semisupervised social graph node classification (SSGNC) attempts to deduce node-related information of social graph with limited labeled training samples. It is primarily deployed in large-scale graph processing, e.g., malicious client detection, knowledge graph, and recommender system. However, in this article, we identify that the SSGNC model is also extremely sensitive to backdoor attacks. We present a novel persistent clean-label backdoor attack (PerCBA) on SSGNC, which selectively poisons unmarked training nodes before learning to compel the trained model to misclassify trigger-embedded inputs into malicious class. Specifically, PerCBA employs a style-agnostic trigger generator with adjustable perturbation strategy to produce perturbed triggers. These triggers are pasted onto a small subset of unmarked nodes (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$&lt; \\, 4\\%$</tex-math> </inline-formula>), enabling the adversary to covertly poison the training graph and implant backdoors into the model without modifying labels. Additionally, to ensure SSGNC robustness when confronted with homogenous threats, we present a testing sample filtering-based defense strategy for PerCBA. It employs feature distribution to identify poisoned nodes and applies Gaussian blur and thresholding to remove the trigger fraction, thereby restoring suspicious data to clean states. Extensive experiments on SOTA SSGNC models and datasets indicate that PerCBA performs high attack success rates (maxima 96.25%) while remaining evasive, and the defense method can effectively mitigate attacks and purify backdoored models."

Here, we propose and investigate a novel dispersive TDRC by employing a vertical cavity surface emitting laser with dispersive feedback from a chirped fiber Bragg grating (CFBG). The CFBG provides dispersive feedback, which leads to fuzzification of feedback delays thus effectively suppresses the clock resonances at critical time ratios. The feasibility of proposed scheme is first evaluated by memory capacity, and then further verified in popular benchmark tasks of nonlinear autoregressive moving average and nonlinear channel equalization. The results show that the proposed dispersive TDRC successfully enhances the computing performances with respect to conventional TDRC at critical time ratios."

Results show that one-fin D-FF designs are less vulnerable than similar two-fin D-FF designs for all tested conditions. Differences in capacitance, drive current, collected charge, critical charge, and sensitive volume lead to the one-fin D-FF outperforming the two-fin D-FF in terms of SEU vulnerability.

    "abstract": "Edge caching in wireless networks struggles to reduce backhaul burden and enhance edge node QoS under deep fading and blocking of offloading links. Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) address this challenge by reconfiguring propagation environments to improve transmission link quality. This study formulates a network cost minimization problem with imperfect CSI, in which content placement and hybrid beamforming are jointly optimized to balance backhaul capacity and transmission power.The problem decomposes into two subproblems: 1. The first subproblem employs probabilistic content placement strategy based on Zipf-distributed popularity, where backhaul capacity is modeled as a function of cached content probabilities, and it is solved by leveraging Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions; 2. Hybrid beamforming is tackled using alternating optimization. Specifically, fixing IRS phase shifts transforms the transmission power subproblem into a convex form to optimize precoder. Conversely, fixing precoder enables solving the reflection beamforming subproblem using a penalty-based convex-concave procedure (CCP) to handle non-convex phase constraints. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly reduces transmission power and backhaul capacity compared to baseline schemes, yielding substantial network cost savings. This work advances caching optimization and transmission robustness in cost-efficient wireless networks under channel uncertainty, demonstrating practical gains via IRS-aided joint design."

    "abstract": "In recent years, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has been used for the nondestructive assessment of the degree of polymerization (DP) of insulating paper, which is a key indicator of its aging degree. The NIR spectra of insulating paper typically contain hundreds or even thousands of spectral features, and the complex nonlinear relationship between these high-dimensional features and DP can be captured by machine learning algorithms, enabling DP prediction model. However, only a small subset of these features is truly relevant to the aging of insulating paper. Identifying and selecting these key features can improve model’s accuracy and interpretability. In this study, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was used to interpret the impact of spectral features on the DP prediction model and extract key features. Insulating paper samples with different aging degrees were prepared by accelerated thermal aging experiment, their NIR spectra were collected, and their DP was determined. A DP prediction model was then developed using all spectral features and Random Forest. SHAP analysis was used to evaluate feature contribution to the model’s predictions of the entire dataset, as well as high and low DP subsets. Based on SHAP feature importance, key features were selected for further modeling, and the performance of models using different numbers of features was compared. The results show that the feature at 1115 nm is the key feature for identifying the aging degree of insulating paper, and the root mean square error of the model modeled using the key features is lower than that of the model modeled using all features (60.0725 vs. 68.2673)."

    "abstract": "In the modern era, multimodal biometric authentication has played an essential role in traditional systems, including face or fingerprint recognition, which face challenges such as spoofing, noise sensitivity, and limited performance. The existing multimodal system integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction, followed by score level fusion mechanism. However, this system failed to include voice modality, relied on fixed fusion rules, and lacked the ability to detect liveness. Hence, this study proposes a transformer-based tri-modal biometric authentication (T-BA) framework that includes face, voice, and fingerprint data. The collected face data is preprocessed using face alignment and illumination normalization, voice silence removal, MelFrequency Cepstral Coefficients for voice data, and fingerprint ridge enhancement with normalization of fingerprint data. Next, modality-specific encoders are employed for the extraction of feature embeddings and integrated through a shared transformer encoder with attention-based adaptive fusion to enable the dynamic weighting of modalities. Finally, classification of the fused representation is performed using a decision module for authentication. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed Adaptive Voice-FaceFingerprint with Transformer (AVFF-T) framework achieved higher accuracy (99.8 %), reduced Equal Error Rate (0.05 %), and improved Area Under Curve (0.998)."

    "abstract": "Compliant direct attach implemented with single phase coolant has been shown to be an effective means of achieving reliable cooling of high-power components. Primary targets of such cooling systems are high power CPUs which have highly nonuniform power densities. While single phase water cooling is effective thermally, it comes with potential issues associated with water leaks. A desirable solution to this problem would be an approach capable of at least similar performance at high local power (core) densities utilizing a non-conductive fluid. Two phase cooling is a candidate but can have instability and dry-out concerns with very high local power densities when implemented in conventional parallel channel form. Expanding channels in a radial configuration have been demonstrated to effectively mitigate these concerns but are difficult to implement in a compliant direct attach configuration due to the central inlet and are best implemented when the device to be cooled is close to square rather than rectangular. In this work we present a cold plate approach implementing multilayer counter-flow expanding channels with a load-supporting outlet plenum which allows compliant direct attach in a small footprint. The design process included multiple rounds of modeling and revision to bring the single-phase and two-phase pressure drops at the flow rate associated with a $50 \\%$ full power vapor quality into the desired range. A thermal test vehicle comprised of an array of 4.2 mm by 4.2 mm heaters of total size 25 mm by 42 mm was used to generate heat distributions of the type seen in large CPU’s, with core “rows” implemented at high power densities and remaining chip areas at low power densities. Effective local cold plate thermal resistance (measured local temperature increase relative to inlet fluid temperature over local power density) as low as $18^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{mm}^{2} / \\mathrm{W}$ was measured which includes both the silicon die resistance and the pad thermal interface material thermal resistance. When the coolant pre-heat impact on the downstream core temperature is included in evaluation of a similar format high-performance single-phase water cold plate, the thermal performance is nearly identical. Overall, this approach appears very promising for water-free high-performance cooling of high local power density devices."

The dynamic behavior of heterogeneous agents—including renewable generators, conventional units, and responsive users—is captured through an evolutionary game-based strategy updating process. A demand-side incentive mechanism, designed with consideration of user preferences and risk sensitivity, promotes active participation in GC trading.

The sensor features stable and cost-effective artificial biorecognition elements, integrated with a 3D-nanomaterials printed transducer for capacitance-based cortisol sensing. An integrated 3D-printed microfluidic channel enables sweat collection for on-demand sensing. A readout circuitry was designed for wireless power and data transmission to a smartphone for real-time data visualization.

The advancement of integrating renewable energy sources and the reduction of carbon emissions through synergistic grid operations have emerged as significant research priorities in this area. This research capitalizes on the inherent flexibility of DC energy usage to establish an optimized capacity planning framework for DCs powered by renewable energy, accounting for a range of energy supply contexts. A low-carbon operational strategy is proposed, with a focus on refining the interplay between DCs and the electrical grid. Through the development of energy consumption and carbon emission flow models, the study aspires to enhance system-wide efficiency while integrating constraints across multiple domains, such as DC infrastructure operations and energy system configurations. Additionally, a multi-energy complementary and coordinated optimization mechanism is examined to align energy capacity planning with data workload management across different scenarios, striving to reconcile economic sustainability with carbon neutrality objectives.

Sensor performance was evaluated in a flow-through system using phosphorescence lifetime measurements under varying analyte concentrations: oxygen (0–210 µM), glucose (0–250 mg/dL), and lactate (0–20 mg/dL). Both fabrication methods produced analyte-responsive barcodes with comparable performance, while 3D bioprinting offered advantages in scalability and structural customization.

However, studies specifically focusing on the influence of air pressure on ion flow field remain limited. Existing measurements of ground-level total electric field at different altitudes are mostly based on full-scale field tests, which are inevitably affected by environmental disturbances. Moreover, the maximum altitude reached in these tests is only 4300 m, which falls short of the highest elevations encountered in current engineering projects. In this study, a measurement platform for the ground-level total electric field of a unipolar line-to-plate configuration was established in an artificial climate chamber with controllable temperature, humidity, and air pressure. A series of measurements and analyses were conducted. Finally, the variation of the ground-level total electric field magnitude directly beneath the conductor with respect to air pressure was analyzed. The results show that, under fixed voltage, the ground total electric field under the conductor increases linearly with the increase of altitude."

    "abstract": "More severe and frequent weather events and natural disasters are having an impact on governments and communities all around the world. They demolish infrastructure, murder people, and ruin economies. Reliable and accurate natural disaster prediction systems can help people get better at preparing for and responding to disasters. The proposed solution deals with this problem through preprocessing and training. Preprocessing, integration, purification, and feature extraction can all help make catastrophe data better. Graph signal processing is a great way to look at disaster data since sensor networks have geographic relationships. The next stage is to use a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look at the data and make predictions about when natural disasters will happen. The model does a better job of predicting human deaths (mean value of 0.973) than more traditional methods. When utilised with strong machine learning models and graph-based data processing, it works well. This study says that GNNs can help us predict natural disasters better. GNNs make accurate and reliable predictions, which then lead to early actions that lower hazards to people and infrastructure."

First, computer vision technology is used to collect real-time passenger data within subway stations, and deep learning algorithms are used to extract and analyze data features. Second, a spatiotemporal data fusion strategy is introduced to improve the model's adaptability to complex passenger flow patterns.

    "abstract": "Rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) is a globally significant oil crop, and its flowering stage plays a critical role in determining yield. Accurate detection and counting of rapeseed flower clusters can assist breeders in predicting field yield and optimizing breeding strategies. We propose an automatic detection and counting method for rapeseed flower clusters based on UAV RGB images, named RFC-YOLO. First, we add the P2 detection layer and remove the P5 detection layer to enhance the model's ability to detect dense small targets while reducing model parameters. Second, a Feature Complementary Mapping (FCM) module was integrated into the backbone to more deeply incorporate spatial location information, thereby improving the localization of small targets. Finally, the SimAM attention mechanism was incorporated to enhance feature extraction efficiency and strengthen the focus on critical information. Experimental results on the test set show that our model achieved a Precision of 91.56%, Recall of 90.78%, and mAP@ 0.5 of 95.94%. Additionally, counting accuracy metrics R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>, MAE and RMSE reached 0.984, 12.46, and 19.06 respectively. The parameters of RFC-YOLO reduced by 67.4%, the model size reduced by 62.0%, which effectively improves the detection and counting performance in complex scenarios while maintaining low computational overhead. The proposed RFC-YOLO model and online detection system provide an efficient and convenient solution for the detection and counting of rapeseed flower clusters."

Then, a voltage feedforward loop is applied to reduce noise in the current control loop. The filters effectively maintained the harmonic content produced by the converter current below the limits established in the IEEE 1547-2018 standard.

    "abstract": "Lead-free electronic assemblies are prone to failure under cyclic loading at high temperature. In applications like automotive control modules, solder joints endure both cyclic mechanical stresses from vibrations and thermal transients due to power switching. At the same time, such electronics operate at very high temperature. The combined effects of cyclic mechanical stresses, thermal cycling-induced strain from CTE mismatches, and prolonged high-temperature operation accelerate fatigue, microstructural degradation, and ultimately lead to solder joint failure. While prior research has investigated the individual influences of isothermal aging or mechanical cycling separately, studies on their combined impact remain unexplored. This study explores how high-temperature aging, mechanical cycling, and their sequence (aging + cycling vs. cycling + aging) affect the constitutive behavior of SAC305 solder alloy. Cylindrical SAC305 uniaxial specimens with desired microstructure were cast in glass tubes utilizing a controlled reflow procedure. The prepared samples were separated into groups, and then subjected to one of two different preconditioning sequences: (1) isothermal aging followed by mechanical cycling (aging + cycling), or (2) mechanical cycling followed by isothermal aging (cycling + aging). The test matrix included high temperature aging exposures performed at $T=125{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ for durations from 0-20 days. The mechanical cycling loadings were performed at room temperature using a strain range of $\\varepsilon= \\pm 0.006$ and a strain rate of $10^{-3} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. The test matrix included cycling durations of 0-300 cycles. After preconditioning, the specimens in each test group were subjected to either uniaxial stress-strain or creep testing. The associated mechanical properties for each preconditioning exposure were extracted from the test data, and then compared to the mechanical properties for pristine samples with no aging or cycling. Our results indicate that the order of aging and cycling exposures is important, and that the samples that underwent cycling before aging exhibited greater mechanical property degradation than those subjected to aging before cycling. For the samples that were cycled first, the microstructural damage during the initial cycling was observed to allow for more rapid IMC coarsening and breakdown of dendritic structure during subsequent aging."

The model aims to minimize the total operating cost of the system under the premise of satisfying the operation constraints of the distribution network, and may take into account voltage stability and load fluctuation by collaboratively optimizing power generation, energy storage charging and discharging, and transferable and reducible loads. The model elaborates the output characteristics of renewable energy, the operation constraints of energy storage system, the implementation mode of demand response, the power flow equation and safe operation constraints of distribution network. The objective function comprehensively considers the power purchase cost, network loss cost, energy storage operation cost and incentive cost and benefit of demand response. Through a case study of an IEEE 33-bus distribution network, the effectiveness of the proposed model is verified, and the potential of demand-side response and energy storage in reducing operating costs, stabilizing load fluctuations, and improving renewable energy absorption capacity is evaluated. The results show that the rational use of demand-side resources and energy storage systems can significantly improve the economy and operational flexibility of distribution networks with high proportion of renewable energy."

First, the mechanism of generator out-of-step caused by HVDC blocking is analyzed. Then, an identification method of cascading failure mode is developed based on energy function method.

The results suggest that participants with stronger field dependence tended to focus more on the background and periphereal scenery, experienced greater sensory conflict, and dropped out sooner than those with more field-independent patterns of gaze. These findings point to a potential correlation between gaze strategies, field dependence, and cybersickness, motivating further analysis of gaze metrics as a predictive tool."

    "abstract": "Immersion cooling systems for data centers are significantly more energy efficient and use less water than traditional air- or water-cooled systems. However, the long-term mechanisms of degradation of Thermal Interface Materials (TIMs) and the effects of the interaction between coolant fluid and TIMs have not been thoroughly studied and there are currently no nondestructive/noninvasive approaches to monitor degradation. Ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation uses high-frequency sound waves to detect defects in a part and characterize its material properties. This paper will discuss the use of ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation to detect changes in material properties in coolant fluids and TIMs as well as scanning acoustic microscopy to map defects in the TIMs. For this purpose, combinations of various commercially available coolant fluids and TIMs were evaluated. TIM samples were placed in coolant fluid and heated at $\\mathbf{1 0 0}^{\\boldsymbol{\\circ}} \\mathbf{C}$ for $\\mathbf{5 0 0}$ hours and $\\mathbf{1 5 0}^{\\boldsymbol{\\circ}} \\mathbf{C}$ for $\\mathbf{1 0 0 0}$ hours (in accordance with JESD22-A103C test standard) to simulate an immersion cooling system in a data center. Then, sound wave speed and attenuation measurements were collected and compared with optical spectroscopy and visual inspection methods to identify the sound metrics most sensitive to material changes. While established chemical and physical experimental characterization was used to provide insight into the fundamental mechanisms of degradation for each TIM-coolant combination, ultrasonic approaches enable more rapid, accessible, and nondestructive characterization. This information may provide the industry with additional methods of degradation characterization which may be leveraged for periodic and/or continuous monitoring."

Additionally, a dedicated small object detection head is introduced, which takes the cross-dimensional attention as input to improve the accuracy of small object detection. Experimental results show that the improved algorithm achieves mAP@0.5 scores of 73.1% and 52.5% on the public datasets RTTS and Foggy Cityscapes, respectively, representing improvements of 3.8 and 5.6 percentage points over the baseline algorithm."

    "abstract": "This study addresses the voltage spike issue caused by dead time during switching transitions in active neutral-point-clamped five-level photovoltaic inverters. Analysis of the conventional ANPC-5L topology's commutation paths reveals that the voltage spikes primarily originate from inductive freewheeling currents flowing through anti-parallel diodes. An improved switching control strategy is proposed to eliminate these spikes, optimizing the switching tube conduction modes and redundant state configurations. This approach reconstructs the freewheeling path during dead time, preventing transient overshoot voltage levels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy suppresses ±2E voltage spikes and significantly enhances the symmetry and linearity of the output current waveform, achieving a total harmonic distortion (THD) of only 1.01%. Notably, this strategy incurs no additional hardware costs and remains compatible with existing control systems, providing an effective solution for the reliable operation of high-voltage, high-power inverters."

Traditional detection methods exhibit limitations in processing massive, dynamic, and contextually complex text data, and existing models struggle to effectively capture the multi-granularity features of sensitive information. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes E-HGA, an innovative architecture that integrates the ERNIE pretrained model with a Hierarchical Gated Attention (HGA) mechanism. The HGA module is designed with three parallel attention branches operating at the word, phrase, and sentence levels, respectively extracting keyword, local composition, and global semantic features. A gated fusion module dynamically aggregates these multi-scale representations, enabling the comprehensive capture of key semantic information from different granularities. Experimental results on the COLD and CSDD datasets demonstrate that the proposed E-HGA model achieves higher F1-scores than mainstream baseline models such as BERT and RoBERTa. This validates the effectiveness of multigranularity collaborative modeling in improving the accuracy of sensitive information identification."

    "abstract": "In the DC traction power supply system, there is a common problem of abnormal increase of rail potential to ground, which makes the potential personal safety hazards to passenger, and the protection closure used in rail potential limiting device will cause a large amount of current leakage, and exacerbate the stray current corrosion. This paper studies the characteristics of DC traction power supply system and train operation, analyzes the rail potential problem under the influence of train braking using DC traction power supply model, and verifies the train operation condition and current flow rule through actual system test. Through the study, the rail potential inhibition measures based on DC bus voltage droop control are proposed, and the results show that the method can effectively inhibit the problem of abnormal elevation of rail-to-ground potential."

    "abstract": "To address the low energy efficiency and instability of IoT sensors operating in complex environments, this paper proposes a front-end circuit optimization design method based on a low-power adaptive algorithm. This method introduces an adaptive mechanism in the front-end signal conditioning and analog-to-digital conversion stages. Combined with signal feature extraction and feedback control techniques, the method dynamically adjusts key parameters such as amplifier gain, filter bandwidth, and sampling frequency by monitoring the input signal's amplitude and rate of change in real time. This ensures that the circuit enters a high-precision operating mode only when needed and automatically switches to a low-power state at all other times. Furthermore, a low-voltage power supply configuration and dynamic biasing techniques are employed to optimize the circuit topology at each stage, effectively reducing both static and dynamic power consumption. Experimental results show that when the input signal is 10 mV, the front-end circuit power consumption is <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$16.3 \\mu ~\\mathrm{W}$</tex> with the adaptive function disabled, and the equivalent input noise level is <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$15.8 \\mu ~\\mathrm{V}$</tex> rms at a gain of 40 dB. This demonstrates the design's reliable signal acquisition capabilities and efficient power management performance under varying signal strengths and environmental conditions. This research provides a feasible technical path for improving the stability and energy efficiency of IoT sensor systems under long-term operation and variable scenarios."

In actual production processes, due to the production environment and other factors, the signal strength of the detection devices may weaken, leading to potential faults in the equipment detection system. To reduce the failure rate of the detection device on storage feeder equipment and enhance production efficiency, a diagnosis and application system based on I/O Link technology for storage feeder equipment is proposed. First, it diagnoses sensors or actuators, collects data such as process values and parameter information, and transmits data parameters such as detection signal on-off status and signal strength to the PLC processor. The program algorithm then utilizes these data to perform functions such as data diagnosis, information feedback, and early warning. Secondly, the control of the inlet and supply systems of the storage bin feeder is optimized. The status information of the sensors is discerned using the I/O Link module, and emergency response measures for the production of the inlet and supply systems are designed. Finally, the real-time status of the storage feeder is intelligently diagnosed, and functions such as intelligent early warning, data assessment, and visual output are implemented through the WinCC visualization interface. Ultimately, intelligent diagnosis of the tobacco storage feeder is achieved."

Femtosecond laser surface processing (FLSP) is utilized to create self-organized, quasi-periodic micro- and nano-scale structures on the aluminum. The FLSP manufacturing technique creates multiscale structures with nanoscale features covering microscale ones in a single processing step. These multiscale structures create additional nucleation sites while also increasing the surface area for fluid interaction. An FLSP surface was tested up to critical heat flux (CHF) with multiple mass flow rates and compared to a polished surface baseline to determine heat transfer improvements over the baseline. Results show enhanced performance for the FLSP surface compared to the polished reference surface with an increase in heat transfer coefficient of over $\\mathbf{1 5 0 \\%}$. Furthermore, the FLSP surface reduces temperature overshoot by more than 50% when compared to the polished surface. These results demonstrate how FLSP on an aluminum surface provides a solution for two phase heat transfer enhancement."

The biosensor leverages the interaction between surface-bound receptors and target biomolecules (AFP proteins) to induce measurable shifts in the acoustic wave properties such as the frequency and insertion loss (IL). The sensing platform is integrated with a microfluidic system, enhancing its real-time detection capabilities and preventing exposure to external influences that affect the signal properties during the sensing process. To achieve high specificity in AFP recognition, the gold surface located at the center of the delay line, matching the size of the aperture, was functionalized. Experimental validations confirmed that the sensor is capable of detecting biomarker concentrations as low as 50 pg/mL (and potentially even lower). The findings highlight the potential of SAW biosensors for rapid, label-free, and non-invasive cancer diagnostics, with implications for early disease detection and clinical applications. Future work will focus on the improvements in biomarker selectivity and detecting lower concentrations, as well as on expanding the technology for broader oncological screening."

    "abstract": "An efficient design methodology is presented for implementing an odd-order variable notch-width (OO-VNW) filter. The OO-VNW-filter complexity is considerably reduced, while its accuracy keeps nearly unchanged. We first discuss how to guarantee the stability of the OO-VNW filter, and then show a 2-step technique for designing the OO-VNW filter. The OO-VNW filter has its coefficients represented using polynomial functions of the notch-width (NW) parameter. The 2-step technique has two goals. One is to reduce OO-VNW-filter’s complexity, and the other is to maintain OO-VNW-filter’s stability. The trick to reduce the complexity is to use the polynomials of unequal orders, leading to the reduction of the total orders. Furthermore, the trick to guarantee the stability is to perform parameter transformations. With the two tricks incorporated into the 2-step technique, a complexity-reduced OO-VNW filter can be designed, while it remains stable during filtering operations. The paper demonstrates an example for validating the 2-step technique, verifying the achieved complexity reduction and superior performance. As compared to the scheme that uses equal-order polynomial functions, the new technique can get an OO-VNW filter whose complexity is significantly reduced, while the performance almost remains the same."

The proposed system integrates a high-efficiency microstrip patch antenna and a rectifier-based RF-to-DC conversion circuit. The antenna is designed to operate within the Ku-band frequency range (12–18 GHz), offering a compact footprint, directional radiation, and impedance matching optimized for maximum power capture. Simulations in High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) indicate that the antenna achieves a peak gain of 5.97 dBi and a return loss of –22.9 dB at the center frequency of 14 GHz, with a bandwidth of 290 MHz. The harvested RF signal is fed into a 5-stage voltage multiplier circuit optimized using National Instruments (NI) Multisim which employs Infenion BAS3005B-02V Schottky diodes to minimize threshold losses. The RF-to-DC converter demonstrates a peak conversion efficiency of 61.2% at an input power of –5 dBm, delivering a regulated output voltage of 3.02V across a 1kΩ load.

The proposed DITC operates as a finite state machine that continuously evaluates the torque error, defined as the difference between the torque reference and the estimated instantaneous torque in each phase. Based on predefined rules and threshold values, the algorithm selects the appropriate switching states for the power converter. The conduction status of each phase is also considered to determine valid switching actions. The control logic is designed to prioritize the incoming phase in the torque production sequence, enhancing system efficiency. Furthermore, the DITC enables operation across all four quadrants of the torque-speed plane. Drive angles were optimized using a one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method to achieve a balance between high efficiency and low torque ripple. The proposed control strategy was validated through simulations and experimental tests in the context of an electric vehicle propulsion system."

The In-place Double Stimulus Quality Scale (IDSQS) allows subjects to alternately view a reference and a distorted image at the same spatial location, facilitating a more intuitive detection of differences in quality, especially at high to visually lossless quality levels. A large-scale crowdsourcing study employing this methodology was conducted, generating a comprehensive public dataset to evaluate perceived image quality across several compression algorithms and distortion levels. An additional contribution is the modeling of quality scores using a Beta distribution, allowing for the assessment of variability and subject consistency. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the IDSQS methodology in achieving high correlation with more precise subjective evaluation benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Mathematical reasoning, particularly within the K-12 education context, demands models that provide not only correct answers but also transparent, interpretable solution paths. Existing large language models (LLMs) often struggle with multi-step math problems due to their limited capacity for symbolic manipulation and structured reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose MetaMath-LLaMA, a novel metacognitive modular framework designed to enhance the reasoning abilities of LLMs through dynamic task orchestration. This framework integrates three core components: a Transformer-based metacognitive scheduler that learns to allocate reasoning subtasks adaptively; a symbolic parser with semantic grounding that fuses syntactic structure with contextual embeddings; and a hybrid symbolic-neural computation unit that seamlessly transitions between deterministic symbolic logic and neural approximation. The entire model is optimized through a multi-task training scheme coupled with curriculum learning and multi-tiered selfvalidation to mitigate reasoning errors and improve interpretability. We expect MetaMath-LLaMA to improve classroom usability by producing clearer step-by-step solution paths, aiding educators in assessment and supporting student conceptual understanding. Our approach offers a more modular, explainable, and effective solution for handling diverse mathematical tasks in K-12 education, and it outperforms traditional monolithic reasoning systems in logical fidelity and conceptual clarity."

Long-distance and stable entanglements are deemed as the lifeline in quantum network communication. However, some weaknesses, e.g., quantum decoherence, scarce quantum memory, and uneven-quality entanglement, of the quantum entanglement hinder the development.

    "abstract": "The integrity of carton packaging is critical to ensuring the efficient circulation of goods in large-scale warehouses. Due to the visual obstructions caused by high stacking of goods, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used for aerial visual inspection. However, limited by onboard computational resources, the detection model must be lightweight. Meanwhile, the diversity of printed patterns on cartons leads to complex backgrounds for defect detection and high inter-class similarity of defect features, so the difficulty of detection is further aggravated. Therefore, we propose an Adaptive and Lightweight Dynamic Sharing-You Only Look Once (ALDS-YOLO) method for visually inspecting large warehouses using UAVs. Firstly, an Adaptive and Lightweight Dynamic (ALD) module is designed to dynamically adjust the weight distribution of convolutional kernels. This effectively enhances the adaptive feature extraction ability of the model and the differentiation ability of the features with high similarity between classes, while reducing the computational complexity. Secondly, a Refined Lightweight Path Aggregation Network (RLPANet) is designed to strengthen the focus on channel and spatial information in bidirectional feature interaction. This enables the network to capture key defect features under complex backgrounds more accurately. Finally, a Lightweight Shared Convolutional Detection (LSCD) is introduced to reduce the computational complexity by using Shared Convolution with compensation mechanism, which avoids independent convolutional operations in each layer. Experimental results on the self-constructed Warehouse Storage Defect Inspection Dataset (WSDID) show that, compared with the baseline model YOLOv11n, the proposed ALDS-YOLO reduces the number of parameters by 11.54%, decreases FLOPs by 36.51%, and improves detection accuracy by 2.5%, which demonstrates that the proposed method better balances the detection accuracy and speed. In addition, the generalization experiments on three public datasets, Cardboard Defect, Welding Defect and GC10-DET, further verify the effectiveness and practicality of ALDS-YOLO in industrial scenarios."

    "abstract": "Prompt learning has made significant progress in vision-language models (VLMs), enabling pre-trained models like CLIP to perform cross-domain tasks with few-shot or even zero-shot learning. However, existing methods tend to overfit the training data after fine-tuning on the target domain, leading to a decline in generalization ability and limiting their performance on unseen categories.To address these challenges, we propose a multi-regularization guided knowledge distillation towards generalizable prompt learning. This approach enhances the model’s adaptability and generalization through different stages of regularization while mitigating performance degradation caused by target domain training. Specifically, within the image encoder of CLIP, we introduce <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Residual Regularization</i>, which binds additional residual connections to certain transformer blocks. This design provides greater flexibility, allowing the model to adjust to new data distributions when adapting to the target domain.Furthermore, during training, we impose <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Self-distillation Regularization</i> to ensure that while adapting to the target domain, the model preserves its prior generalization knowledge. Specifically, we regularize the intermediate layer outputs of Transformer Blocks to prevent the model from excessively favoring target domain data. Additionally, we employ an unsupervised knowledge distillation strategy to enforce multi-level alignment between the teacher and student models by <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Direction Distillation Regularization</i>.

    "abstract": "Entanglement routing selects a path to establish entanglement connections between two arbitrary nodes in quan-tum networks, which plays an important role in quantum com-munication. In quantum networks, quantum decoherence and limited network performance make it challenging to distribute entangled pairs. Many entanglement routing schemes have been proposed to solve this issue but most of them are in a centralized and synchronized manner. However, they may be infeasible in large-scale quantum networks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a distributed and asynchronous entanglement routing scheme called DFER in which quantum nodes manage requests autonomously. The major challenge is quantum nodes have little knowledge about entangled pairs, which hinders the ability to establish fidelity guaranteed entanglement connections. To ad dress this challenge, we develop DLFR algorithm which estimates the fidelity of end-to-end entanglement connections based on link-level fidelity and calculates link-level fidelity requirement based on the characteristic of purification. Among nodes which meet link-level fidelity requirement, we design DFPS path se lection algorithm to select next hop with the highest expected throughput to distribute entangled pairs. Numerous simulation results demonstrate that DFER can efficiently distribute fidelity guaranteed entangled pairs with high throughput."

    "abstract": "To perform aerial manipulation with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), it is essential to develop countermeasures against dynamic disturbances affecting the UAV. Aerial manipulation typically involves controlling the UAV’s attitude using an inertial measurement unit (IMU), adjusting the speed of each rotor, and managing the trajectory of the manipulator mounted underneath the UAV. Ensuring both manipulation and flight stability requires a robust control system and reliable state estimation algorithms. These algorithms can be developed either through simulation modeling or iterative real-world testing. While simulation is cost- and time-efficient, real-world testing provides more accurate results but is costly and risky due to the operational characteristics of aerial manipulation. This paper introduces a hybrid Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation (HILS) framework, which enables real-time control design under near-real-world conditions. A UAV model is applied in the HILS to replicate actual flight and measure disturbances occurring during operation, and a control system is subsequently configured using Model Predictive Control (MPC). The primary objective of this study is to establish a hybrid HILS platform for UAV–manipulator systems and to employ it for rigorous evaluation and validation of control strategies. The novelty lies in integrating MPC within this HILS framework to assess robustness against manipulator-induced disturbances. MPC is benchmarked against a conventional PID controller, highlighting the advantages of the proposed approach. Validation is conducted by transferring the simulation results to a real UAV–manipulator platform and performing flight experiments."

However, the existing DTD formats present information in an incompatible way, hindering interoperability between different Digital Twins (DTs). This paper focuses on enhancing the interoperability between DTs described with different DTDs to enable collaboration between DTs and the autonomous operation of smart factories. First, the paper identifies the necessary data fields for collaboration. Thereafter, the presence of these fields is examined in the current DTD formats. If a format lacks necessary data fields, the paper proposes how these data fields should be incorporated into the format. Finally, the paper presents how the fields in different DTDs could be mapped to enable interoperability between them. The collaboration of DTs is demonstrated by controlling an industrial machine. In the use case, the machine in the factory is represented using AAS and Web of Things Thing Description documents. These DTDs were hosted in a local area network. After the client retrieves the document from the hosting service, the necessary information is extracted from the DTD to enable further collaboration with the DTs. The use case demonstrates that the proposed approach is well-suited for facilitating collaboration in smart factories. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that with minor adjustments, the current DTDs can be made more interoperable. Future research should consider creating DTD templates for various types of DTs and making them publicly available. This would enable a consistent DTD structure for DTs that share the same <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">type</i> data field."

Because of the L1<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub> ordering in the perpendicular direction, a FePt grain is essentially a set of Fe atomic monolayers exchange coupled via the Pt monolayers alternates in between throughout the grain height. Consequently, the exchange between adjacent Fe monolayers becomes dynamic if the magnetization within a grain becomes non-uniform during recording processes. It is shown that such dynamic exchange coupling leads to domain wall trapping in the absence of write head field, forming stable “zero-moment” grains. Such mechanism enables a three level recording with a single pass and raises linear recording density by over 50% without increasing flux change density."

This report explores strategies for utilizing silicon nanowire (SiNW)- to obtain memristive biosensors to recognize DNA sequences. By tuning the Schottky contacts, the sensing device exhibits distinct memristive behaviors, facilitating applications to in-memory sensing. On the contrary, the device may exhibits less memristive behaviour and, so, facilitating in-sensors computing.

However, the existing Cascaded Multichannel and Hierarchical Fusion (CMC-HF) framework exhibits limitations in explicitly modeling temporal speech-facial dependencies and aligning modalities across variable time scales. To overcome these challenges, this research proposes a Speech-Facial Dynamics (SFD) transformer-based architecture that jointly processes acoustic and facial motion streams. Initially, data collected from the Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) dataset consisted of approximately <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 2}$</tex> hours of audiovisual data recorded from <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 0}$</tex> professional actors engaging in scripted and improvised dialogues. The speech encoder processes Mel-spectrogram patches with local-global attention and auxiliary prosodic supervision, whereas the facial encoder integrates both appearance and dynamics through convolutional features and landmark-optical flow embeddings. A multiscale bidirectional cross-attention fusion module aligns temporal speech-facial cues, guided by a contrastive alignment loss, to produce robust fused representations for categorical and dimensional emotion prediction. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed SFD transformer-based model showed an improved accuracy of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 2. 5 \\%}$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{F 1}$</tex>-score of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 1. 3 \\%}$</tex> when compared with the existing CMC-HF model."

    "abstract": "Today, increased carbon emissions are driving climate change, necessitating a transition to low emission energy sources requiring an acceleration of the expansion and supply of renewable energy. The transport sector can significantly contribute to decarbonization through electrification. Being resource-efficient for many applications, Light Electric Vehicles (LEVs) offer a promising solution. Most LEV sharing systems currently rely on a \"milk run\", where service trucks—typically powered by combustion engines—collect, centrally charge, and redistribute vehicles or batteries, ultimately increasing LEVs' environmental impact. Solar charging stations (SCSs) are a viable option that provide decentralized, renewable energy without requiring grid connections. The current study examined user satisfaction with existing SCSs for shared LEVs and the importance of factors related to SCSs shaping future preferences and behaviour. Data were collected via an online survey from users with and without prior experience at two SCS locations. Key themes of the survey included demographics, usage behaviour, accessibility, location, user-friendliness, communication, and incentives. Users were generally satisfied with the SCS, though location satisfaction was higher in Oberhausen than Essen (cities in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany). Accessibility and user-friendliness were rated highly, with simple language and intuitive operation deemed important. While appearance was less critical, visibility and parking were key concerns. Incentives, especially free ride minutes, were effective, with 65% considering them very important. Future locations for SCSs included residential areas and transport stops. Challenges included maintenance issues, vandalism and risk of scooters being unplugged, with users willing to spend an average of 15.9 minutes charging."

Traditional cooling methods may struggle to keep up, leading to the need for more advanced liquid cooling or immersion systems to maintain efficiency, reduce overheating risks, and ensure system longevity. Nowadays, water, or a mixture of propylene glycol and water has been used as a coolant in indirect contact liquid cooling system such as cold plate assisted solution. However, water cooling systems in electronics face challenges like leakage, which can cause significant damage to sensitive components if not properly managed. Even minor leaks pose a risk of short circuits and corrosion, potentially leading to system downtime or costly repairs. The conventional engineering artwork to mitigate these risks is to ensure leak-proof connections, in time leakage detect, and regular maintenance, but not fully solve leakage issue. This is one of critical industry pain points of water-cooling solutions massively deployed with luxurious AI servers in data center.In this paper, a novel cooling solution featuring cold plate and centric distribution unit (CDU) design based on dielectric coolant with innovative SuperFluid technology is introduced. This solution has overcome water cooling leakage issues and lab validation results have proved its applications with more than 1500W TDP (Thermal Design Power) processors in high dense AI server system."

The method considers the relevance and redundancy of features, designs the dual evaluation fitness function, and applies a genetic algorithm for feature selection to ensure that the selected features are not only highly relevant to the target data but also significantly reduce the redundancy between features to realize the globally optimal feature selection. In order to verify the effectiveness of the method, the power load curve prediction is carried out, and the Attention mechanism is introduced to eliminate the \"the occurrence of anomalous volatility\" in the load curve prediction. Finally, an experimental analysis is carried out with real load data of a province as an example, and it is verified that the prediction accuracy is improved by applying the feature selection method, and the influence of features on load prediction is further analyzed to enhance the interpretability of the model."

This project proposes a smart, wearable collar system that could deliver real-time health and location information for animals from large wildlife species, such as elephants, to roaming cattle and vulnerable calves. Conventional monitoring techniques such as manual observation and tagging are time consuming, are not real-time, and do not track important health parameters. This solution fills those gaps with a technology-based, humane response. It combines lightweight, non-invasive sensors such as the MLX90614 for temperature, MAX30100 for oxygen saturation and heart rate, MPU6050 for motion tracking, and a GPS module for tracking location. All these are controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller that processes and sends data to a cloud platform for remote monitoring. This allows for timely detection of health irregularities, unforeseen patterns of behavior, or boundary crossings. Built for durability and nonintrusiveness in mind, the collar has scalable use in both forest and agricultural environments. For wild animals, the system can support migration studies and help detect signs of stress or disease. For farm animals and pets, it lets farmers track health and reduce losses, especially in young calves. Overall, it works as a practical and ethical tool for both conservation and livestock care."

    "abstract": "Time series data often suffers from resolution limitations due to hardware constraints, sampling frequency restrictions, or economic considerations. While super-resolution techniques have seen significant advancements in computer vision, their application to spatio-temporal data presents unique challenges that remain under-explored. We argue that pure generative or auto-regressive approaches are subpar for the multi-modal super-resolution task. Hence, we introduce ChronoFusion, a novel hybrid model that simultaneously enhances both spatial and temporal resolution of time series data. Our approach leverages a graph variational autoencoder combined with adaptive attention mechanisms to generate high-resolution time series from low-resolution inputs. Unlike previous methods that handle spatial and temporal super-resolution separately, ChronoFusion integrates both dimensions through a proxy subspace. Extensive evaluation on traffic datasets in various locations demonstrates that ChronoFusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 10% on average in interpolation fidelity on unseen nodes while maintaining temporal consistency. Furthermore, our model demonstrates strong capabilities in handling missing data. The method's versatility across diverse spatio-temporal traffic applications makes it a valuable contribution to time series analysis and modeling. Github Repo"

In this paper, three type defect specimens are designed to simulate three typical discharges, including tip discharge, surface discharge and floating discharge. The experimental platform is established for non-partial discharge tests. The PRPD (phase-resolved partial discharge) patterns of three typical defects are obtained and their partial discharge characteristics are investigated. The insulating defects including the discharges in the air and epoxy resin are both considered; in addition, the initial and intense discharges are investigated. The results show that the PRPD pattern of the tip discharge has a polarization effect, and the corona discharge caused by high voltage affects the PRPD pattern during the intense stage of the discharge. The PRPD pattern of the surface discharge have a triangular distribution, and the phase forward shift occurs in the intense discharge stage. The amplitude of the floating discharge is relatively small, and the phases are concentrated at 0°-45° and 180°-270°. In comparison with the initial discharge stage, the corona present in the air during intense discharges exerts a significant influence on the PRPD patterns of various discharges at high voltage and leads to dispersion of the discharge."

    "abstract": "Meta Quest Store: https://www.meta.com/experiences/stanford-mri-simulator/8205539289482347/Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can be a stressful experience for pediatric patients due to the loud acoustic environment, enclosed scanner bore, and a prolonged requirement to remain still. While sedation is commonly used to manage anxiety and motion, it carries clinical risks and logistical burdens. Traditional preparatory approaches—such as instructional videos and mock scans—often lack engagement for older children and adolescents. In this study, we present a comparative evaluation of four MRI preparation modalities: (1) a gamified virtual reality (VR) simulation that trains stillness through real-time feedback; (2) a passive VR experience replicating the MRI environment without interactivity; (3) a 360° first-person video of a real MRI procedure; and (4) a standard 2D educational video. Using a within-subjects design (N = 11, ages 10–16), we assess each method’s impact on head motion data, anxiety reduction, procedural preparedness, usability, cognitive workload, and subjective preference. Results show that the gamified VR condition has significantly lower head motion (p < 0.001) and yielded the highest preparedness scores (p < 0.05). Head motion data were significantly correlated with learning outcomes (p < 0.01), suggesting that behavioral performance in VR strongly indicates procedural readiness. While all modalities reduced anxiety and were rated usable, interactive VR was preferred by most participants and demonstrated unique advantages in promoting engagement and behavioral rehearsal. We conclude with design recommendations for designing immersive simulations and integrating VR training into pediatric imaging workflows."

    "abstract": "As augmented reality (AR) becomes increasingly integrated into everyday life, ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of its virtual content is critical. Our research addresses the risks of task-detrimental AR content, particularly that which obstructs critical information or subtly manipulates user perception. We developed two systems, ViD-DAR and VIM-Sense, to detect such attacks using vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules. Building on this foundation, we propose three future directions: automated, perceptually aligned quality assessment of virtual content; detection of multimodal attacks; and adaptation of VLMs for efficient and user-centered deployment on AR devices. Overall, our work aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned framework for safeguarding AR experiences and seeks feedback on perceptual modeling, multimodal AR content implementation, and lightweight model adaptation."

In this research, it present a methodology for sales forecasting with the goal of making supply chain operations more sustainable through more accurate sales predictions. To make sure the data is consistent and the model is ready to go, the methodology starts with data pre-processing, which includes scaling and encoding. Then, the most useful attributes from the dataset are extracted using feature extraction algorithms. A strong prediction framework is provided by a hybrid model that combines CNN and BiLSTM networks. This model captures both spatial and temporal patterns in the data. To evaluate the model's usefulness, it is subjected to testing using a prototype that was created in a lab. This allows for the simulation of real-world scenarios. The suggested CNN-BiLSTM model achieves a high accuracy rate of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 8. 4 2 \\%}$</tex> in sales prediction, according to experimental results, which is a considerable improvement over previous models. Results like this show that the model can handle complicated sales data and could improve sustainable supply chain operations.

The research follows a multistage approach, starting with a microstudy designed to investigate existing team building practices. Its results were used to model a workflow for planning teamwork activities. To address specific team needs, we applied an existing conceptual model integrating Tuckman’s model to assess a team’s current stage, and service quality dimensions. In this way, team building activities may be analyzed through specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), before and after the interventions. To assess the effectiveness of this method, a case study was designed and conducted in a remote environment. Its impact was observed by analyzing performance metrics, conducting to improvements both in team collaboration and service quality."

To address the increased issue of food scarcity, lack of arable land, and environmentally constrained space in urban areas, we aim to design and implement a vertical farming system with advanced IoT sensor networks composed of DHT11 temperature and humidity sensors as well as lux light intensity sensors, and manual measurement of plant height to monitor crucial environmental parameters in real time. Data was gathered constantly at one-minute intervals for two weeks with both cloud and local systems to ensure robust and scalable data acquisition for a variety of use cases. Afterwards, short-term temperature forecasting enabling proactive climate control to optimize resource use and crop yield was done with classical time series approaches (ARIMA) and deep learning techniques (LSTM) based models. Analysis showed that the baseline for ARIMA was strong, but the LSTM model performed somewhat better, demonstrating the advantages of AI enabled predictive control in indoor vertical farming. The model increases environmental stability and energy efficiency while laying the groundwork for smart urban agriculture systems that fosters sustainable development."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of 5G infrastructure demands increasingly intelligent and context-aware resource allocation strategies to satisfy the stringent and heterogeneous requirements of Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC), Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), and Massive Machine-Type Communication (mMTC). Building on our previous work on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-driven Slice Admission Control (SAC), which prioritised URLLC traffic under gNodeB (gNB) congestion, this paper introduces key enhancements to support more realistic, large-scale deployment scenarios. Specifically, we integrate a load balancing (LB) metric directly into the DRL reward structure, enabling agents to optimise not only SLA satisfaction but also fairness in resource utilisation across gNB clusters. Additionally, we extend support to mMTC slices and evaluate the DRL framework's resilience under transient service disruptions. Using Monte Carlo simulations in our fully softwarised gNB environment, we benchmark three DRL algorithms, namely Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Rainbow, against a baseline LB heuristic. Results demonstrate a drastic reduction in slice block rates, rapid recovery post-disruption, and more stable load balance utilisation across all DRL-driven methods. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of joint SAC-LB-aware optimisation for dynamic Open RAN-based 5G networks."

The study evaluates the dynamic response of both control approaches in maintaining voltage stability. The GFL strategy relies on a cascaded control structure in the dq reference frame, where voltage regulation is achieved through an outer-loop controller. The GFM approach, based on the Synchronverter concept, emulates the behavior of a synchronous generator, inherently providing voltage and frequency support. Simulations are performed using the IEEE 12-bus benchmark system to assess the impact of each strategy on power system stability. The simulations are implemented in PSCAD. The results contemplate voltage perturbations, large load connections, severe short circuits and current limitation during the fault for both control strategies, as well as for the system without E-STATCOM. The findings highlight the advantages and limitations of each method, offering insights into their suitability for modern power grids with high renewable energy penetration."

The framework consists of two sequential steps: (1) calculation of row-level shading fractions derived from solar geometry and array layout; and (2) estimation of power losses due to shadinginduced attenuation of plane-of-array (POA) irradiance and activation of bypass diodes. The proposed approach is applied to fixed-tilt and single-axis tracker PV plants in 12 Brazilian cities. Hourly shading fractions are calculated for multiple array configurations, and hourly power losses are estimated from reductions in POA values, which are obtained from global horizontal irradiance (GHI) using the top decomposition-transposition model combinations determined through statistical evaluation of 400 model combinations. The simulation tool quantifies shadinginduced losses across multiple PV array layouts at temporal resolutions from hourly to annual, thereby providing designers with a practical tool to optimize plant design and performance."

This combines a user-customized Korean city recommendation system with virtual reality (VR) technology, and utilizes personalization technology tailored to individual interests, creating immersive content. With this, we may have just experienced a virtual world, even though we are staying at home and not spending a lot of time or money, until we start doing this. That is, we can virtually visit anywhere and at any time we want to go. By providing users with a healing experience through VR travel, we can spread a positive image of the destination, raise expectations about travel, and give psychological satisfaction.

Operated under single-phase-shift modulation, the topology is particularly suitable for high-voltage and high-power applications. To ensure proper power sharing among modules, a multivariable control approach is introduced that combines partial feedback linearization (eliminating the nonlinear dependence of power on the phase-shift angle) with small-signal linearization around the steady-state operating point to derive control-oriented models. These models enable the implementation of decoupled loops for output-voltage regulation and input-voltage balancing. The proposed strategy is validated through real-time Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) tests using a three-module ISOS converter."

Among these concerns, the prediction and evaluation of students' psychological stress constitute a significant aspect. The psychological pressure of students is a key issue in mental health, necessitating accurate predictive models for early prevention of any fatal outcomes. Traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques are employed to predict the mental stress of the students. However, these algorithm has high probability rate of producing inconsistent performance that leads to the high false rate during its prediction process. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel combination Support Vector machines (SVM) and Dolphin optimization-based evaluation framework for predicting and evaluation the students mental stress The framework was evaluated using Kaggle's Student Mental Health datasets with the more than 1000 records. Furthermore, performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall are calculated and compared with the other traditional learning algorithms. Results demonstrates the efficacy of the model by achieving the accuracy of 0.998 with the F1-score of 0.99 respectively. The proposed network has established the new path of transforming the conventional framework into cognitive way of predicting the mental stress that helps to assessing the mental health status of college students."

The model integrates experimentally relevant conditions and parametric sweeps to identify optimal energy-efficient operating windows. Electric potential varied from -2.72V to -1.77V across a 0–2A current sweep. Current density visualizations revealed significant edge concentration at lower currents, which improved with increased current input, achieving uniformity at 1.5–1.75 A. Energy consumption was calculated directly from the simulation outputs using electric potential, total current, and process time, enabling realistic energy consumption analysis. The study links current field distribution with energy optimization, offering an insight to scalable, resource-efficient EC design framework aligned with SDGs 6 (Clean Water), 9 (Industry Innovation), and 12 (Responsible Production).

The proposed approach leverages fuzzy logic to adaptively tune PID gains in real time based on system frequency deviation and its rate of change. Each control area is equipped with a governor-turbine-generator model and is interconnected via a tie-line, enabling coordinated control. For optimizing the controllers, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is implemented here. The proposed strategy offers improved robustness against load disturbances and system uncertainties, making it a viable solution for modern power systems with increasing complexity and variability."

    "abstract": "Accurate plant organ segmentation is essential for enabling high-throughput extraction of plant phenotypes, as it provides the foundational data for both trait measurement and structural modeling. Although existing studies have made significant progress, plant semantic segmentation (stems and leaves) across multiple species remains underexplored. To this end, this paper introduces an edge-aware downsampling algorithm and a novel network for segmenting plant point clouds at multiple scales, named MSPlantSegNet. Experimental results on a dataset of tobacco, tomato, and sorghum demonstrate that MSPlantSegNet attained superior performance across all four key metrics-precision (97.13 %), recall (95.63 %), F1-score (96.20 %), and IoU (93.14 %). MSPlantSegNet surpasses a set of leading models, including PointNet++, PointNet, ASIS, DGCNN, PlantNet, PSegNet, and PointNeXt. This research has valuable implications for plant phenotyping, the development of smart agriculture, and ideal type selection."

    "abstract": "Increased power consumption and heat dissipation in chips, systems, and data centers necessitates an integrated approach in energy and thermal management. Thermal and energy management solutions must account for energy flow from the energy source to the chips, and heat flow from the chips to the cooling towers. Increasing complexity of chips also require consideration of structural integrity of chips and interconnect, power delivery, power management, high-speed signaling, repairability, and reliability. This paper presents a comprehensive supply-demand based framework for energy and thermal management of chips, systems, and data centers. It references previous research for in-depth information, including key papers from earlier Itherm conferences. The intent is to serve as a guide by providing salient elements that make up the big picture, and provide metrics grounded in fundamentals. Regarding the latter, the paper proposes a thermodynamics-based metric as a key performance indicator of the overall system. Underpinning the holistic framework presented in the paper are the fundamental principles taught by contributors like Dr. Richard Chu and educators like Prof. Francis Huang at San Jose State University. Learning and inspiration from Prof. Huang’s application of the $2^{\\text {nd }}$ law of thermodynamics and exergy analysis is a key element of the framework presented in this paper. Indeed, exergy analysis was an integral part of machine age engineering workflows leading to projects like hydro-electric plants for aluminum factories. Modern data centers, akin to those aluminum factories, depend on such power infrastructure established by our predecessors. With AI driving the growth of data centers and their energy demands, returning to exergy analysis is essential."

Our initial findings indicate that this hybrid system can elicit laughter, storytelling, and a sense of social closeness.

Augmented reality has shown promise as an assistive tool for high-stress work domains and MCI triage both in the field and for prefield training. However, the vulnerability of MCIs makes it challenging to evaluate new tools designed to enhance MCI response. In other words, profound evolutions like the integration of augmented reality into field response require thorough proof-of-concept evaluations before being launched into real-world response. This paper describes two progressive simulation strategies for augmented reality that bridge the gap between computer-based simulation and actual field response."

The most influential features are then selected for fusion by evaluating the contribution of each feature to the classification task. The algorithm achieves an average classification time of approximately 19.4 seconds, with a classification accuracy exceeding 97 % across multiple data points.

To address such issues, this paper proposes a joint optimization algorithm that integrates deep neural modeling and variational inference framework, aiming to simultaneously improve the clarity and stability of images. Firstly, a pluggable structure based image enhancement strategy was constructed to address the issue of hidden noise in the dark regions, which is difficult to handle. A trained denoising network and an improved Retinex theoretical model were introduced to work together to achieve significant image quality improvement and interference elimination. Secondly, considering the insufficient interpretability of deep learning methods, this paper introduces wavelet compression mechanism and designs a Soft AE structure with logical traceability to quantitatively evaluate the internal behavior of the model from two dimensions: static analysis and dynamic feedback, providing new ideas for the study of model transparency. Finally, in order to balance image edge clarity and texture suppression, this paper introduces a self-adjusting regularization term based on local feature weighting, and combines it with semi quadratic solving techniques to achieve efficient optimization. The experimental evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm exhibits excellent performance in multiple image processing tasks, and has broad practical application value and theoretical promotion significance."

This study deeply integrates Internet of Things (IoT) technology to innovatively design a safety protection system for new energy excavator cabs. It is equipped with a high-stability STM32/STC main control system, multi-type sensor monitoring network, 5G real-time communication module, electromagnetic control airbag system, and stable power supply system. Supporting trigger programs are developed to ensure the efficient collaborative operation of each module. Adopts a dual-mechanism architecture of “active defense + passive response”. The active safety module is equipped with an OPW airbag protective cover, which triggers the airbag to deploy in milliseconds to reduce crush injuries to drivers. The passive safety module integrates flame, smoke, and temperature sensor arrays to monitor and handle fire situations in real time. Through the IoT communication module, key information such as the location of the danger and the type of accident is synchronously transmitted to the remote monitoring center, providing accurate data support for emergency rescue. Experimental verification using a scale model of the Volvo EC160E electric excavator shows that the system performs excellently in simulated scenarios of tipping, heavy object impact, and fire.

Our findings from dyadic VR conversations show that patterns of turn-taking and nonverbal behavior significantly correlate with perceived social connection. Building on this, we extend our analysis to group conversations to explore more complex interaction structures. This research contributes to computational models of social cognition, offers a scalable method for quantifying social experience, and informs the design of socially responsive agents capable of lifelike, multimodal interaction."

    "abstract": "Biometric recognition has become essential or, preferably, the most significant method for identification and authentication in various sectors. This research explores the feasibility of using lips and nose as additional modalities for identification and authentication with high accuracy and precision. The lips possess several distinct attributes, including shape, texture, color, and well-defined boundaries, making them suitable for recognition. Similarly, the nose has various features such as size, shape, curvature, nostril width, and unique markings, which also qualify it for biometric analysis. This work aims to discuss the current status of development in lip and nose biometrics, encompassing feature extraction techniques, matching algorithms, and image capture systems. A lightweight authentication system has been implemented on a Raspberry Pi using these modalities. The recognition phase of the model faces unique challenges due to appearance variations caused by factors like pose, expression, occlusion, lighting, and cultural diversity. Historically, these challenges have limited the broader application of these modalities, but advancements in technology and knowledge are improving their results, precision, and reliability. Thus, it is anticipated that they will continue to progress in certification and potentially expand their application in other secure authentication systems. To date, all research on lip and nose recognition has been conducted on desktop computers; however, I have implemented this recognition on a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi, achieving an accuracy of 91.95 % with an authentication time of 2600 milliseconds. This research on nose and lip biometrics highlights potential future trends, which may lead to increased usage of these biometrics across various disciplines."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of digital communication platforms has intensified the requirements of efficient mechanisms in analyzing and promoting local culture dissemination, where traditional rule-based and statistical methods are prone to difficulties in dealing with dynamic, nonlinear, and high-dimensional data patterns. Current systems depend mainly on rule-based systems and shallow neural networks, which yield suboptimal precision, poor generalizability, and inadequate adaptability to heterogeneous cultural datasets. Traditional proposed frameworks like simple BP Neural Networks or isolated CNNs are concerned solely with static feature extraction and do not address sequential dependencies that are essential for modeling cultural evolution. To address these limitations, a hybrid deep learning model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for spatial feature abstraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for sequential pattern extraction is proposed, allowing for sound analysis of cultural diffusion trends. Experimental results show that there is an evident performance gain with 97.7 % accuracy and 96.8 % F1-score compared to existing models. The advantage of the CNN-LSTM mechanism is that it can better balance spatial-temporal learning, mitigate loss of information, and improve interpretability, thus presenting a more efficient and scalable approach to local culture dissemination evaluation."

    "abstract": "Next-generation high-performance computing (HPC) systems require power delivery solutions capable of sustaining beyond 1 kW per monolithic chip, with current densities expected to reach or exceed $2 \\mathrm{~A} / \\mathrm{mm}^{2}$. Distributed vertical power delivery (DVPD) architectures with integrated voltage regulators (IVRs) address this challenge by placing conversion stages closer to the processor, thereby reducing conduction losses. However, the interplay between temperature-dependent power dissipation and substrateembedded microfluidic cooling-particularly in 3D-stacked configurations where inner tiers have limited heat dissipation pathways-has been underexplored. This paper presents a PyAEDT-driven, automated electro-thermal modeling framework for 48 -to- 1 V DVPD architectures to accurately capture realistic power losses and pumping demands. Results demonstrate that ignoring electro-thermal feedback leads to significant underestimation of both power loss and IVR area. An electrical-only analysis predicts a total converter loss of 251.86 W, whereas integrating thermal effects raises this value to 285.91 W -an increase of about 13.5%. Likewise, IVR sizing grows by approximately 11% to mitigate elevated on-resistance and switching losses at higher temperatures. To maintain hot-spot temperatures below $85^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, the required microfluidic flow rate must rise from $1 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{s}$, which is needed without considering electro-thermal interactions, to $2.47 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{s}$, generating a pressure drop of 47.9 kPa. Despite this higher flow rate, the pumping overhead remains only 122.32 mW, which is negligible compared to the extensive conduction and switching losses that would occur in inadequately cooled systems."

However, low-resource language pairs—especially those involving regional dialects like Myanmar and Dawei—continue to pose significant challenges due to the scarcity of parallel corpora and the linguistic diversity they exhibit. This limitation highlights the necessity of fine-tuning models and optimizing hyperparameters to enhance translation performance, particularly for the Myanmar-Dawei language pair. This research explores the fine-tuning of pre-trained Opus-MT models on a Myanmar-Dawei parallel corpus for bidirectional translation tasks. We compare a baseline model, Transformer-based NMT, to fine-tuned Opus-MT models. The fine-tuned Opus-MT model achieved impressive BLEU score of 56.49 for Dawei to Myanmar and 45.40 for Myanmar to Dawei translations.This improvement demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging pre-trained models for low-resource and dialectal translation tasks, contributing to the preservation of linguistic diversity and enhancing digital communication for underrepresented dialects such as Dawei. These findings underscore the importance of employing specialized fine-tuning of pre-trained models for low-resource language pairs and suggest promising directions for further optimization."

However, existing approaches to learn the skills and best practices to create software architectures and the underlying domain models with the help of AI expect a certain level of experience in software engineering. Besides, current approaches to configure LLMs with prompt engineering to answer as an AI tutor rather assist students in learning basic programming skills in university courses than in software architecture design. In this paper, a four-step-approach is proposed to prompt LLMs, namely ChatGPT-4o and Llama 3.1, to act like a tutor and help novices in software engineering build their own software architectures, apply best practices and understand them. To do this, the LLMs receive initial prompts with the assignment of a tutor role, and descriptions of the target group, system’s requirements and context. Then, example questions, domain models, and software architectures will be sent to the LLMs and evaluated if the answers relate to the models and requirements and comply with the initial prompt. Tests with the MobSTr dataset showed overall suitability of these LLMs for tutoring in software design, but also limitations regarding some general answers and the processing speed of local built LLMs."

The framework integrates a policy-level network and an execution-level network to enable cooperative optimization. Specifically, the policy-level network dynamically captures the state of the production environment through multidimensional encoding, thereby facilitating adaptive weight allocation across multiple objectives, such as maximizing on-time delivery rate and minimizing makespan. Based on the composite reward function derived from the policy-level decisions, the execution-level network selects the most appropriate scheduling rule from a set of classical dispatching heuristics. Comparative experiments are conducted against traditional scheduling rules and other reinforcement learning-based methods. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed TDQN framework in solving multi-objective real-time scheduling problems in the wafer photolithography area."

Specifically, the GAN-SCMA model is designed for scenarios involving a single mediator and leverages adversarial training to enhance the estimation of nonlinear causal effects. The GAN-MCMA model handles multiple unordered mediators by enabling parallel mediation modeling. For mediation structures with sequential dependencies, the GAN-CMCMA model is introduced to capture the propagation of effects along causal chains. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models significantly outperform traditional methods and baseline architectures in terms of estimation accuracy, stability, and generalization capability."

    "abstract": "Ferrite cores are widely recognized as the most effective magnetic materials for medium to high-frequency power electronic applications due to their low losses in dynamic conditions. However, there is an increasing demand for further improvements in their composition and manufacturing processes to reduce losses at the frequencies used by modern electronic switching devices. This is essential for achieving significant reductions in the weight and volume of magnetic cores in contemporary power electronics. To address this need, an efficient tool capable of accurately predicting eddy current losses in ferrites becomes crucial. In this study, we propose two simplified approaches in the frequency domain for modeling these losses in ferrite cores with a toroidal shape. Additionally, we demonstrate how these models can be extended to the time domain and applied to non-sinusoidal signals. The key material parameters—geometric, electrical, and magnetic—required for running the models are measured. We then compare the performance of these models against experimental measurements taken from three different commercial MnZn ferrites (N30, N87, T38) across a broad frequency range (100 kHz to 2 MHz). Furthermore, the T38 ferrite is also evaluated under non-sinusoidal operating conditions. An in-depth analysis of the results is presented, providing insights into the performance of the models for each ferrite material."

    "abstract": "Although meta-learning models have achieved some success in few-shot cross-domain diagnosis tasks, they still face three major challenges: insufficient feature extraction capability, an uncontrollable domain adaptation process, and low discriminability of class features. To address these problems, a few-shot cross-domain fault diagnosis method for complex mechanical equipment based on multi-angle Taylor prototypes (MATM) is proposed. First, after constructing the dynamic graph autoencoder, the adjacency matrix is updated during the training process to capture the dynamic variations in fault data, which enhances the model’s ability to learn key features. Next, a Gaussian distribution-guided domain adaptation module is constructed, which imposes a Gaussian prior constraint on the latent space during the domain adaptation process to guide the optimization direction of domain-invariant features, thereby promoting the alignment of feature distributions across different domains. Finally, a multi-angle Taylor prototype metric module is constructed to perform nonlinear expansion of supporting features in high-dimensional space, optimizing the quality of class prototype representations from multiple perspectives to more accurately capture the class relationships across different domains. Experimental results on reducer datasets show that, compared to the latest methods, the proposed method improves the average classification accuracy by 1.98% across all diagnostic tasks, demonstrating superior performance in small-sample cross-domain fault diagnosis tasks."

The coefficients of the filters and estimators are jointly calculated and updated using the decision-directed least mean square (DD-LMS) algorithm. The phase information derived from the first-stage phase estimator can be used to estimate and compensate for frequency offsets without incurring additional overhead. By eliminating phase fluctuations from the error signal, these phase estimators enhance the system’s resilience to frequency offsets and phase noise. Simulation results for a 60 GBaud dual-polarization 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (DP-16QAM) signal demonstrate the effectiveness of frequency offset estimation and compensation, showing that the performance of the proposed FDE is consistent with that of time-domain equalizers (TDE). Furthermore, we conduct an experimental demonstration utilizing 62.5 GBaud DP-16QAM transmission. The results are similar to those obtained in the simulations, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. When compared in terms of computational complexity, FDE has a much lower computational complexity than TDE."

    "abstract": "Traditional bandgap-based current references display various limitations. This includes large temperature coefficients (TCs) across process corners, necessitating costly trimming cycles, and area inefficiency for low current values (<10 μA). This work addresses these shortcomings by generating a complementary to absolute temperature (CTAT) current that reproduces the temperature dependence of the proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) current including its curvature over process corners, eliminating multi-temperature TC trimming while retaining a single-point room-temperature calibration to set the absolute current. The design provides this matching PTAT/CTAT feature by relying on the temperature-stable negative TC of the electron mobility to generate the CTAT current instead of the nonlinear and process-sensitive diode-based CTAT generation. Moreover, thanks to the mobility-based CTAT generation, high-resistivity undoped poly resistors with a strong negative TC can be used, enabling area-efficient CTAT current generation in the sub-μA to single-digit μA range. To validate the proposed approach, we fabricated a prototype design in a 130nm SOI CMOS technology, occupying an active area of only 0.016 mm2 and operating over a wide supply range from 1.6V to 3V. Measurements from 10 chips yield a mean current of 1.1 μA (σ/μ ≈ 4.4%) close to the design target of 1.2 μA. Experimental results further demonstrate an average TC of 110 ppm/∘C from 0 ∘C to 100 ∘C without multi-temperature trimming, an average room-temperature supply line sensitivity of 1000 ppm/V, and a load sensitivity better than 250 ppm/V."

    "abstract": "Humans regularly throw projectiles with high speed and accuracy; some animals, including chimpanzees and elephants, also throw objects occasionally. In comparison, robots are currently lagging behind, despite having lower communication latency and more accurate motor control. To understand this paradox and ultimately achieve ubiquitous throwing robots, one of the major obstacles is the lack of high-fidelity and tractable physical models of the transient release dynamics, where the momentum exchange between the hand and the object occurs within tens of milliseconds via the frictional interface. In this work, we try to establish a physical model for the release dynamics. We first demonstrate that the conventional model, which combines rigid-body dynamics and patch friction (limit surface, LS), struggles to capture the release dynamics and exhibits pathological behaviors, such as Zeno-like oscillations, leading to poor accuracy in predicting throwing outcomes. To mitigate this, we formulate a viscous-smoothed variant of the limit surface model solved via implicit integration (ILS), which achieves high predictive fidelity but incurs significant computational cost. On the other hand, motivated by the dominant effect of in-hand pivoting in release dynamics, we propose a Sliding Pivot (SP) model that simplifies the contact dynamics by capturing the sticking-pivoting-sliding behavior emerging under vanishing normal force. This model achieves accuracy comparable to ILS, with only 10% higher error while offering over 20× faster computation. Compared to conventional LS models, our method reduces horizontal velocity prediction error by 40% and angular velocity prediction error by 63%, achieving 2.4 cm mean absolute error (MAE) for landing position and 15.4 degrees MAE for landing orientation. These results provide a robust, physically grounded foundation for future scalable robot throwing systems."

    "abstract": "Tactile and proximity sensing is essential for robotic tasks involving human-robot interaction (HRI) and manipulation. However, existing dual-mode sensors often face challenges such as environmental interference, large sizes, and task-specific limitations. This study proposes a dual-mode photoelectric sensor that integrates tactile and proximity sensing. The tactile sensing mechanism is based on a variable optical path structure, while the proximity sensing relies on the surface light reflection. The sensor exhibits a high sensitivity (up to 1.12 V/N), compactness (4 mm thickness), and desirable stability with a drift of less than 1% over 8,000 repetitive cycles under pressures ranging from 0 to 63 kPa. A general tactile-proximity servoing framework is also proposed for the dual-mode sensor array which enables tactile servoing, proximity servoing and hybrid tactile-proximity servoing. Under this framework, parameters can be flexibly adjusted to adapt to different servoing tasks including position and orientation control of the robotic arm's end-effector. In more complex robotic tasks, a real-time fruit ripeness classification method is developed based on the proposed sensor. Using the proposed TPNet, the classification method can achieve an accuracy of 94.4% in a four-level tomato ripeness classification task during grasping."

Existing stability criteria for DC networks often rely on simplified models neglecting source converter controller dynamics, limiting their applicability in practical controller design. To overcome this, a singular perturbation-based framework is proposed to derive analytical stability conditions for closed-loop DC distribution network systems. By decomposing the high-dimensional Jacobian matrix into two structured low-dimensional matrices, tractable stability criteria are established using properties of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) matrices. Sufficient stability conditions for local stability of a VSR-based DC distribution network are derived without requiring global VSR information, while a robust stability criterion dependent solely on maximum load data is developed to handle uncertainties. These results provide explicit design guidelines to enhance robustness and reduce computational complexity in stability analysis. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

Although some methods have been developed for robust NE, these results rely on complete information about the game. We instead consider a scenario when only the uncertain parameters and associated perturbed NE are available, but the players' weights in the aggregator are unknown. With the uncertain parameters and perturbed NE constituting data, we propose data-based optimization to inversely learn players' weights in the black-box aggregator. We then use the learned weights in a transformed augmented problem without uncertainty and derive the first-order conditions for computing the robust NE. Furthermore, we characterize the generalization guarantee of the proposed learning approach in terms of violation probability."

Despite extensive studies on external contaminants and cellulose aging products, the generation of solid particles from insulating oil decomposition under discharge and thermal stress remains poorly understood. Based on micro-flow imaging technology, this paper experimentally investigates the formation characteristics of impurity particles in naphthenic mineral insulating oil under different discharge energies, focusing on the analysis of particle quantity, size distribution, and morphological changes. The results indicate that insulating oil decomposes during discharge, generating a large number of carbon particles, with micron-sized particles below 5 μm predominating. Under experimental conditions, particle quantity and discharge energy exhibit a strong linear correlation independent of electrode size. Although the particle size distribution is independent of discharge energy, its bluntness index increases significantly with increasing energy. This study reveals the pattern of micron-sized particles generated by the decomposition of insulating oil itself, providing a new theoretical basis for diagnosing and assessing the risk of internal discharge faults in transformers."

However, applied to multiconnected domain waveguides, we demonstrate analytically and numerically that MASVN-MAS may suffer from spurious solutions. This phenomenon, previously overlooked in MASVN-MAS studies, restricts its applicability to such waveguides. Furthermore, based on the idea of MASVN-MAS, we extend auxiliary sources from monopoles to dipoles and establish a MAS based on the dipole auxiliary source vector norm (DASVN-MAS). Our results reveal that spurious solutions of DASVN-MAS still exist in multiconnected domains waveguides. To address this issue, a mono–dipole auxiliary source is introduced into MAS, termed a MAS based on the mono–dipole auxiliary source vector norm (MDASVN-MAS). In contrast to MASVN-MAS and DASVN-MAS, numerical results indicate that MDASVN-MAS has no spurious solutions in multiconnected domain waveguide analyses."

Recently, multipath components (MPCs), as a type of spatial resource, have the potential to improve the sensing performance in ISAC systems, especially in richly scattering environments. In this paper, we propose to leverage MPC and Khatri-Rao space-time (KRST) code within a single ISAC system to realize high-accuracy sensing for multiple dynamic targets and multi-user communication. Specifically, we propose a novel MPC-enhanced sensing processing scheme with symbol-level fusion, referred to as the “SL-MSP” scheme, to achieve high-accuracy localization of multiple dynamic targets and empower the single ISAC system with a new capability of absolute velocity estimation for multiple targets with a single sensing attempt. Furthermore, the KRST code is applied to flexibly balance communication and sensing performance in richly scattering environments. To evaluate the contribution of MPCs, the closed-form Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for location and absolute velocity estimation are derived. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed SL-MSP scheme is more robust and accurate in localization and absolute velocity estimation compared with the existing state-of-the-art schemes."

This paper proposes a novel framework leveraging logistics vehicle data for rapid distress detection and tracking. A deep convolutional neural network, enhanced with a dual-layer routing attention mechanism, improves detection precision for minor distresses. The optimized Boundary Box Regression (BBR) loss function increases accuracy for common distresses like cracks. A three-stage distress matching algorithm, based on an attentional graph neural network and adjacent-local-area matching, removes duplications and tracks distress deterioration. The Bernoulli function assesses minimal sampling frequency for road segments. Validated in Shanghai, this method achieves 79.6% mean Average Precision (mAP) and a 75.66% matching rate, enabling daily updates for timely maintenance decisions."

    "abstract": "As thermal model complexity increases, model simplification has become essential. This is particularly true for 2.5D SiP (System in Package) designs, which require a simplification methodology due to the inclusion of multiple HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) components. Various methodologies, such as DELPHI, 2-R (two-resistor), and in-house models, have been developed for different purposes. However, these existing methods are not suitable for our specific needs, prompting the development of a new methodology. This new approach must meet the following criteria: i) handle multiple heat sources, ii) include software-independent components, iii) be adaptable to power maps, and iv) maintain a temperature error margin of less than 1%. An HBM detail thermal model consists of 8,12, or 16 core dies, depending on the total number of die stacks. A single core die (DRAM: Dynamic Random Access Memory) includes various cuboids, such as dies, bumps, active layers, and EMC (Epoxy Molded Compound). In contrast, our HBM CTM (Compact Thermal Model) simplifies this structure to just four cuboids, representing a base die, two core dies, and EMC implying that the detail information of HBM is encrypted. To better understand the temperature distribution and heat transfer rate within the detail HBM model, heat equations were defined for each layer, and the isotropic equivalent thermal conductivity was obtained through matrix calculations. The results showed good agreement with CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulation results under various power dissipation scenarios and controlled conditions, where uniform power was applied and the temperature was monitored at the center of the die. To enhance the versatility of the HBM CTM, including the incorporation of power maps and arbitrary temperature locations, additional anisotropic thermal conductivity components were required. These components were calculated using RSM (Response Surface Methodology), with 210 DOEs (Design of Experiments) conducted to extract the temperature estimation function, which includes parameters such as in-plane and out-of-plane thermal conductivities for the base and core dies. Our HBM CTM reduces computational time by a factor of 5 to 8 while maintaining temperature accuracy within 0.19% for a standalone HBM and within 0.72% for an HBM in SiP."

    "abstract": "Passive cooling technologies, such as heat sinks, have been widely employed as a reliable solution for efficient heat dissipation, offering the advantages of zero energy consumption and minimal maintenance. However, as the demand for high-performance electronics continues to rise, passive cooling alone is insufficient to meet the thermal management requirements of advanced systems. Recently, synthetic jet (SJ) technology has emerged as a promising active cooling method. SJs, also referred to as zero-net-mass-flux (ZNMF) jets, are produced by an actuator that drives surrounding fluid in and out of a cavity through an orifice, resulting in enhanced airflow within the system. This study explores the thermal performance of two distinct configurations of SJ-integrated heat sinks. The first configuration incorporates an array of multiple orifice SJ devices (SJDs) embedded directly within the heat sink, while the second involves SJDs impinging from above the heat sink. In the embedded configuration, the number of SJDs (2 and 4) and their operating frequencies are varied at a fixed excitation voltage. In the SJDs of impinged configuration, arrays of satellite orifices are positioned around a central orifice, and the number of arrays is adjusted while maintaining a constant central orifice diameter. Additionally, the impingement distance, or the gap between the SJD and the heat sink fins, is varied to analyze cooling performance. The results demonstrate that the embedded SJD heat sink provides superior heat transfer enhancement and reduced footprint area compared to the impinged SJD heat sink. The heat sink is also tested under natural convection conditions for a baseline design. It is found that the Nusselt number has been augmented three times with a low power consumption (1W)."

The proposed approach allows a single electronic unit, consisting of a DC/DC converter and measurement circuitry, to address multiple series-connected cells. As a consequence, the overall effort and hardware resources required for individual cell voltage measurement as well as charge and discharge control are significantly reduced. Bidirectional switching is realized using “constant-current-injected MOSFETs” (CCI-MOS), enabling a compact and cost-effective implementation of the switch matrix. The circuit topology is straightforward to implement and can be flexibly scaled with respect to both the number of accumulator cells and the balancing current. To demonstrate the practicality of the approach, a compact multiplexer prototype has been developed. This prototype directly controls up to 18 battery cells. With a current-handling capability of +-10 A, the module achieves fast and efficient cell balancing."

    "abstract": "Accurate and real-time 3D human pose estimation is essential for safety-critical applications such as intelligent surveillance, yet remains challenging in resource-constrained and dynamic environments due to its high computational demands. To address this, we propose a cooperative edge inference method for real-time 3D pose estimation in mobile edge computing networks. End devices equipped with lightweight models apply dual confidence thresholds to filter uncertain inputs, offloading only the selected images to an edge server for refined inference. We formulate a joint optimization problem to determine the optimal confidence thresholds and transmission times per device with the aim of minimizing the mean per-joint position error under end-to-end delay constraints. To evaluate the proposed method under controlled and repeatable multi-view conditions, we developed a virtual 3D simulation environment in Unity that mimics motion scenarios and provides accurate ground-truth pose data. Experimental results demonstrate a clear trade-off between accuracy and latency, and confirm that the proposed method significantly improves estimation accuracy while consistently meeting delay requirements."

    "abstract": "The importance of developing batteries with high reliability and safety, capable of withstanding various environmental factors and long-term use, is growing. Silicon materials have gained attention due to their high theoretical capacity, low potential difference with lithium, and abundant resources. However, significant challenges such as volume expansion and efficiency degradation due to energy loss remain. To address these issues, comprehensive understanding of electrical, chemical, thermal, and mechanical properties are required incorporating chemical potential, stress, and species transport. This study presents a multiphysics simulation model focusing on the mechanical energy dissipation of silicon anodes, particularly emphasizing expansion and plastic deformation. Implemented in the MATLAB environment, the model calculates the dissipation of electrical, chemical, thermal, and mechanical energy and demonstrates the state of charge (SOC) during charging and discharging cycles. The SOC varies with energy dissipation and anisotropy across different C-rates, and the results provide a comparative analysis of strategies to improve the mechanical stability of silicon anodes. The model validates galvanostatic responses under various C-rate conditions, and cycle-based energy dissipation, highlighting the necessity of mechanical dissipation in the development of next-generation silicon anodes. Future works will focus on the mechanical dissipation in alloying-based anodes such as SnBi. This research highlights the long-term stability and cyclic efficiency of alloying-based anodes for high capacity and durable battery systems."

    "abstract": "Is it possible to predict decision-making during automated driving solely through gaze data? To address this question, this study recruited 54 participants and implemented a two-step decision-making process in a high-risk, conditionally automated driving scenario. The first-order decision involved determining whether to intervene in autonomous control, and the second-order decision required choosing between self-sacrifice or harming others. An analysis of gaze data from 16 to 2 seconds prior to the event onset revealed significant differences in gaze patterns across the different decision groups. For the first-order decision, the intervention group (Manual) fixated more frequently on the road, the cliff, and surrounding elements, whereas the non-intervention group (Auto) maintained their gaze primarily on the forward windshield, implying differing information-seeking strategies between groups. For the second-order decision, the group that chose to harm others (Manual-Collide) concentrated their gaze on the front and the cliff, whereas the group that opted for self-sacrifice (Manual-Fall) distributed their gaze across various Areas of Interest (AOIs) until the moment of decision. This pattern implies that the collide group reached their decision at an earlier stage, while the fall group sought alternative solutions until the last moment. These findings suggest that gaze data could serve as a cognitive indicator, reflecting the flow of human judgment and the underlying intent behind decisions."

Simulations conducted in PLECS validated the control strategy, confirming that the proposed phase-shifting technique effectively suppresses dc-link voltage ripple while allowing impedance estimation. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments were carried out using the Typhoon HIL 402 and the Texas Instruments F28379D controlCARD, confirming the feasibility of the method in real time.

Misalignment and latency between virtual content and real-world objects in AR HUDs can lead to cognitive delays and visual discomfort, ultimately lowering user satisfaction and causing physical fatigue. To address this, the proposed system divides on-device AI processing into three real-time modules: (1) perceptual state analysis, (2) spatiotemporal alignment correction, and (3) user feedback-driven adaptive content control. Each module reflects real-time user feedback, dynamically adjusting alignment according to contextual awareness, multisensory inputs, and perceptual thresholds. This human-centered design reduces visual latency, mitigates disorientation and fatigue, and enhances information delivery during driving, thereby ensuring safety. As a methodological basis, a user scenario-based approach is adopted, shifting the paradigm performance-centered AR design to predictive, perception-driven AI-human interaction models."

    "abstract": "Chiplets have emerged as an important solution to meet the complex and diverse needs of the electronics market while continuously improving performance, despite the limitations of process scaling. Consequently, system-on-chip (SoCs) are shifting from traditional planar structures to three-dimensional stacked architectures, resulting in a significant increase in heat dissipation per unit area. This has made thermal management a critical performance-limiting factor. To address thermal issues, thermal-aware floorplan design processes are being considered from the early stages of SoC design. Thermal characterization models based on thermal resistance matrices have proven to be valuable tools to predict temperature contour on die, considering both self-heating effects and thermal coupling effects through the principle of linear superposition. However, modern application processors (AP) operate in diverse thermal environments, where operating frequency and boundary conditions are controlled based on temperatures measured by thermal sensors under various operational scenarios. Therefore, there is a need to extend thermal characterization modeling using thermal resistance matrices to accommodate these varied convective heat transfer conditions. We propose a thermal performance evaluation process based on Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) thermal resistance matrices, The proposed process incorporates convective heat transfer coefficients (HTC, h) as thermal boundary conditions applied in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models. Thermal resistance matrix models are extracted for various representative HTC values for the temperature evaluation of the chip, HTC is calculated based on the monitored temperature of specific regions, and a thermal resistance matrix is extracted using linear interpolation. This process demonstrates improved accuracy over previous thermal resistance matrix-based thermal evaluation methods by better reflecting boundary conditions"

Two control strategies are compared: autonomous operation based on local volt-watt curves and coordinated operation via a power management system (PMS) located at the point of common coupling (PCC). Simulation results using the CIGRÉ European LV benchmark feeder demonstrate that the coordinated strategy achieves regulatory compliance with 20 % lower rated power per BESS unit compared to the autonomous approach. Furthermore, the coordinated strategy ensures uniform active power dispatch among the devices, promoting balanced thermal stress. Importantly, both control strategies operate without requiring any knowledge of the LV grid topology."

However, the Customizable Unique Node Access (CUNA)-based deep encryption model has limited scalability, verifiable provenance, and lacked advanced analytics for accurate medical interpretation. To overcome these limitations, this research proposes a hybrid Blockchain and Convolutional Neural Network (B-CNN) model for secure cloud-assisted medical image processing. Initially, data is collected from medical imaging devices integrated with hospital information systems and sensors. Preprocessing at the edge nodes then performs normalization of image dimensions, anonymization of patient identifiers, denoising, and metadata generation. Encrypted medical data are stored off-chain, whereas a permissioned blockchain records immutable hashes, access policies, and consent. A CNN-transformer hybrid network extracts spatial features through convolutional layers and global context from transformer encoders and then combines them for accurate classification to enhance scalability, security, diagnostic precision, and trust in cloud healthcare systems. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed B-CNN model outperformed the existing CUNA model in terms of accuracy (93.23 %)."

These masks are applied to the original images so the models can focus only on the important parts. The masked images are then passed into three deep learning models, ResNet152V2, DenseNet121, and VGG-19, which work together to predict if a person has COVID-19. Since there were fewer COVID-positive images, targeted data augmentation was applied to balance the dataset during training. Finally, a majority voting method was used to combine the predictions from the three models. The system achieved an accuracy of 96 %, showing that focusing on the lungs and balancing the dataset can significantly improve detection performance."

As the use of these materials are expected to grow further with increased use of electronic components for automation, AI and the Electric Vehicle industry, it is necessary to also take a look at the impact of the materials on the environment as a parameter to guide the material selection, so that we may not only select the best performance to cost, but also the sustainability of the selected material. Here we have presented an initial study towards building a dataset to provide a carbon footprint for bio-based v/s non-bio-based epoxy composites with conductive and non-conductive fillers. The key performance parameters measured are the thermal conductivity, glass transition temperature and dielectric breakdown strength. The effect of the filler type (h-BN, Silica, Alumina) and the filler size on these properties are presented. A life-cycle impact analysis (LCA) is presented to discuss the environmental impact and sustainability of the epoxies and fillers corresponding to the measured parameters. From the initial study and life cycle analysis, it is observed that epoxy resin plays a key role in the environmental impact of the composites even for highly filled formulations, and a switch to bio-based materials would help significantly reduce this impact. The highest thermal conductivity improvement of 294% and dielectric breakdown strength improvement of 119% were achieved using $1.5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ hBN at $30-40$ weight % filler loading."

This paper designs and researches a real-time debris flow monitoring system based on edge computing and the YOLO11 algorithm. The system adopts the Tianmin RK3588 Androidbased edge computing box as its core hardware device, with cameras deployed around mountain slopes and connected to the edge computing box to enable real-time video data collection of the monitoring area. At the edge computing box end, the lightweight YOLO11n model processes the real-time video stream, accurately identifying targets such as debris flows, falling rocks, trees, and people. Through a predefined judgment mechanism, the system can quickly detect the occurrence of debris flows and issue corresponding alarm levels based on the disaster situation, realizing lightweight algorithm deployment and real-time response. Meanwhile, the system uploads relevant video data of debris flow events to the cloud platform, providing emergency departments with more detailed disaster information for in-depth analysis and subsequent decision-making. This design fully leverages the advantages of edge computing in low latency and local processing, as well as the efficient target detection capabilities of the YOLO11 algorithm, effectively improving the real-time performance and accuracy of debris flow monitoring and providing strong technical support for the emergency prevention and control of geological disasters."

    "abstract": "The active development of the Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology as well as the Voice Conversion (VC) has posed an outstanding danger to the digital security. To overcome this obstacle, this paper will compare and contrast systematically three different deep learning structures, a hybrid CNN-RNN framework that aims to conduct both spectral and temporal artifact processing, a CNN-LSTM ensemble framework exploring the distinctive capabilities of the spatial and temporal processing, and a state-of-the-art system with Wav2Vec2 as a pre-trained feature extractor and as a Light Convolutional Neural Network (LCNN) to make predictions. Although all these architectures operate on the basis of known elements, they are new in the way that they specifically aim at deepfake detection and also they are assessed and evaluated in an unprecedented way in parallel. With experiments on a wide variety of benchmark datasets, such as ASVspoof 2019, WaveFake and FoR, this paper compares the trade-offs between feature-engineered and self-supervised methods. As the results show, CNN + LSTM-based platform can deliver better results, its analysis accuracy is 99.81, because it is able to get deep, context-sensitive representations of unprocessed audio. The present study highlights the symbiosis of organizing various deep learning techniques and establishes a complete reference in future studies in resilient equipment of deepfake voice detecting."

Each participant is issued an RFID card, which, when scanned, logs their attendance in real-time. The system operates within a closed-loop framework, ensuring data security and privacy. Upon recording attendance, the system automatically dispatches notifications to both the higher authorities and the individual concerned. This immediate notification system serves as a dual-purpose tool: keeping authorities informed of attendance patterns and providing individuals with confirmation of their recorded presence. The technology reduces manual errors, eliminates the need for paper-based attendance records, and streamlines the process for both participants and administrators that can generate comprehensive attendance reports, aiding in decision-making and policy formulation for improved attendance management. Through this innovative approach, organizations can ensure higher compliance, timely interventions, and foster a culture of accountability and transparency."

    "abstract": "Effective cooling strategy is critical to achieve improved performance and efficiency in electric-drive vehicle motors. Among approaches, direct winding heat exchangers (DWHXs), positioned inside the motor component slots, have demonstrated superior potential for cooling compared to conventional methods such as forced convection air cooling and liquid jacket cooling. In this work, an in-slot heat exchanger (HEx) based on the DWHX concept is developed for an outer-rotor motor with a 100 kW peak and 55 kW continuous power output, and 50 $\\mathrm{kW} / \\mathrm{L}$ power density. Initial work developed a baseline additively manufactured aluminum oxide heat exchanger to cool concentrated stator windings in an 18 -slot, 16 -pole outer-rotor motor; however, it lacked performance in cooling stator endwindings. A new design was envisioned to address this issue. The present study introduces a novel in-slot HEx design, which also incorporates a cooling solution for end-windings at both sides of the motor. The thermal performance of this new design is assessed and compared with the baseline concept. The results from the new design indicate an over 50% reduction in thermal resistance and more than 30% reduction in hot-spot temperature. The new design reduces end-winding temperature while maintaining improved thermal uniformity across the winding. The increase in pressure drop in the new design adds only 0.013 W to the pumping power. Furthermore, the results indicate that a potting material used as an interface material - with a thermal conductivity of 3$4 \\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{m} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}$ - to attach these heat exchangers to motor components is found optimal to ensure effective thermal performance. The achieved performance is realized without altering critical electromagnetic parameters, facilitating seamless integration with the current motor design. These results underscore the potential of ceramic-based in-slot HExs in improving the thermal performance and efficiency of modern electric-drive vehicle motors, representing a substantial advancement in the development of high-power-density electric motors."

    "abstract": "Rectifiers, including half-wave and full-wave types, are fundamental components in power conversion circuits, converting alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC), and being used in various applications. Generally, diodes and rectifiers work well and are studied up to $\\mathbf{1 2 5}^{\\boldsymbol{\\circ}} \\mathbf{C}$. Temperature changes can significantly affect their effectiveness and performance, especially at temperatures up to $\\mathbf{1 7 5}^{\\boldsymbol{\\circ}} \\mathbf{C}$. High-temperature operation results in the rectifier’s efficiency loss due to high heat dissipation and other changes. The performance of rectifiers, including noise immunity and reliability, diminishes as temperatures rise, particularly in harsh environments like automotive and aerospace applications. The testing undertaken in the present study will provide valuable data for optimizing rectifier performance and ensuring the durability of electronic devices that operate in hightemperature scenarios. Data has been presented based on a detailed examination of both half-wave and full-wave rectifiers subjected to controlled high-temperature conditions. Performance metrics are offered at three critical stages: before, during, and after exposure to elevated temperatures. These metrics are compared to the room temperature datasets or the standard dataset. This approach will allow us to analyze the impact on diode characteristics, such as forward voltage drop and leakage current, and overall rectifier efficiency. By evaluating these factors, one can understand how high temperatures influence the performance and reliability of rectifiers. Results presented in the paper focus on how high temperatures impact the efficiency and output characteristics (e.g., DC output voltage and ripple) of half-wave and full-wave rectifiers by comparing the data for varied temperatures and with room temperature/standard data. In addition, operational stability and reliability are presented under prolonged hightemperature conditions."

In this work, the effect of the bottom side thermal boundary condition on the calibration of the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) and the measurement of the device temperature rise was investigated by applying GRT to a bare device die and an identical device die solder-bonded to a CuMo shim. It was found that the probing location of the thermocouple utilized during the calibration process can result in a 12% difference in the deduction of the TCR. Furthermore, the temperature rise of a GaN HEMT on a bare die with no thermal interface material between the bottom of the device die and the thermal stage could be $2.35 \\times$ greater than a same device mounted to a CuMo shim due to wafer bow that results in a large thermal contact resistance. Therefore, proper experimental setup was found to be crucial in order to extract the correct TCR and temperature rise within GaN HEMTs with complex topside geometries where GRT is needed."

This paper introduces a novel voxel-based approach for efficient generation and direct fabrication of porous structures. Leveraging GPU-accelerated parallel voxelization enables rapid geometric construction.

Azure Event Hubs are used to feed data with low latency, MLflow is used to track and retrain models, and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) input is used for adaptive anomaly detection. The suggested method works as shown by a real-life case study in a petroleum pipeline monitoring system. The system was able to identify anomalies 94.7% of the time, had 38.5% less detection delay than most edge-only models, and was up 22% more of the time. Using streaming feedback loops cut the time it took to reset the model to less than 30 minutes, which made it more adaptable in real time.

Traditional deep learning approaches, although effective in image classification, usually struggle to generalize against subtle manipulation artifacts, compression noise, and temporal inconsistencies. To address these challenges, a MultiStream Convolutional Neural Network (MS-CNN) framework is proposed for robust deepfake detection. Initially, utilizes the FaceForensics++ dataset which is a widely recognized benchmark containing authentic and manipulated facial videos. Preprocessing incorporates face detection, alignment, and the generation of complementary modalities, which include frequency-domain representations, residual noise maps, and temporal signals, such as rPPG and optical flow. These multimodal inputs were passed through parallel CNN streams for feature extraction to capture spatial, spectral, and temporal inconsistencies. The extracted features are combined using an attention-based adaptive fusion mechanism that dynamically learns the relative importance of each modality. Finally, a fully connected softmax classifier produces end-to-end predictions that differentiate between real and fake videos. The experimental results show that the MS-CNN obtains higher accuracy (99.77 %), precision (98.95 %), recall (98.45 %), and F1score (98.76 %) when compared with the existing CNN model, which improves detection robustness and generalization in different manipulation techniques."

    "abstract": "Recently, Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) have emerged as crucial enablers of intelligent transportation systems to allow secure communication among vehicles and roadside infrastructure. However, conventional VANETs face challenges such as scalability and vulnerability to secure attacks because of their dynamic and distributed nature; thus, blockchain-based schemes improve trust and data integrity, while edge computing reduces latency. However, existing models suffer from heavy consensus overheads and lack strong decentralized security. Hence, this study proposes a directed acyclic graph-based shared blockchain with edge-assisted consensus (DAG-SBEC) to ensure secure and real-time communication in large-scale VANET deployments. Initially, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) was employed to ensure lightweight key management and secure credentials. Then, blockchain sharding with a beacon chain distributes the data and reduces the consensus overhead. Furthermore, the DAG ledger combined with HotStuff consensus allows for rapid and scalable transaction confirmation. Subsequently, edge computing at roadside units (RSUs) provides low-latency verification of vehicle messages. Finally, smart contracts with threshold disclosure handle revocation and accountability. The results show that the proposed DAG-SBEC outperformed the existing Federated Q-learning with secured Blockchain-aided Elliptic Cryptography (FQL-BEC) in terms of average latency (790.572 ms) and consensus delay (48 ms) respectively."

To increase the resilience, robustness and reliability of the plant, this work proposes the application of a rectifier with IGBTs for use in PEM electrolyzers with the capacity to operate even during the loss of one of the phases of the rectifier supply. In this situation, the equipment operates with reduced power, however it is possible to maintain hydrogen production, thus minimizing losses related to the total shut-down of the operation during an event in the network or during scheduled maintenance on circuits of one of the phases of the plant. Also, by avoiding the unexpected shut-down in the voltage supply to the electrolyzer, the proposed method reduces the risk of the electrolyzer stack being damaged in the case of a phase loss. This work presents the development of the proposed method, as well as simulation results demonstrating the equipment operation in both three-phase and two-phase situations."

As the cultural heritages are more in the other languages, it is essential to explore and investigate its richness that can add more insights in inidvidual's life. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is considered as a hybrid combination of Artificial Intelligence(AI), especially natural language processing. The main purpose of NMT is to convert text from one language to another, enhancing both comprehension and shared learning. However, translating the morphological language to English remains significant bottleneck for achieving the high translation accuracy and fluency.

Even though these social media platforms have many advantages, they have also led to cyberbullying, which regularly happens when utilizing these networks. Statistics reported that 75% of online cyberbullying occurrences occurred on Facebook, compared to 24% on Twitter and Instagram combined. However, the existing cyberbullying detection accuracy rate is still low due to the feature selection and classification techniques used. Against this backdrop, this research is aimed at analyzing cyberbullying behavior, identifying machine learning algorithms for detecting cyberbullying on Facebook, and testing the machine learning algorithms for detecting cyberbullying on Facebook with higher accuracy. The result of the study indicates that the cyberbullying detection on Facebook using the RBF kernel SVM and consideration of the five selected elements of detection features upper-case character count, personal pronoun count, profanity count, exclamation mark count, and word count has achieved an accuracy of 93%. In the future, other detection techniques and algorithms and other elements of detection features can be used to improve the model’s performance."

    "abstract": "Recent technological advancements in the packaging and integration of electronics in compact systems have introduced a growing demand for efficient and thin heat spreading devices. For various applications, it would be further beneficial to have passive heat spreaders that are also bendable during assembly or end use. Traditional wick-based heat pipes are susceptible to performance degradation under bending due to their sensitive internal wick structures. Oscillating heat pipes (OHPs) are a wickless alternative, leveraging oscillating plug flows within simple channels or tubes, thereby offering a promising solution for bending-tolerant passive two-phase heat spreading. This work introduces the fabrication and testing of a submillimeter thick copper OHP device that maintains functionality under bending. The device is fabricated using an etching process that yields $\\sim 250-300 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ deep and $1000 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ wide channels on a 500 $\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ thick copper substrate, masked with photoresist, using ferric chloride (FeCl<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</inf>) etchant. Sealing is achieved through thermocompression bonding with a $127 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ thick copper top plate and an intermediate electroplated tin layer. The vacuum-holding capability of the OHP is validated under both flat and bent conditions, demonstrating the structural integrity. Thermal performance tests in horizontal and vertical (gravity assisted with bottom heating) orientations demonstrate effective thermal resistance reduction compared to baseline uncharged copper channels. These results demonstrate significant progress toward bendable copper OHPs that could offer adaptable thermal solutions in next-generation compact electronic systems."

These generated views provide the multi-view input required by modern self-calibrating reconstruction algorithms. This approach not only resolves severe occlusions but also circumvents the need for fragile pre-calibration, making the system robust against physical disturbances. A preliminary evaluation demonstrates the ability to reconstruct the appearance of occluded regions. This cost-effective and minimally invasive approach opens new possibilities for easy-to-deploy HCI applications."

    "abstract": "With the scaling up of transistor densities, the thermal management of integrated circuits (IC) in 3D designs is becoming challenging. Conventional simulation methods, such as finite element methods, are accurate but computationally expensive. Compact thermal models (CTMs) provide an effective alternative and produce accurate thermal simulations using numerical solvers. Recent work has also designed machine learning (ML) models for predicting thermal maps. However, most of these ML models are limited by the need for a large dataset to train and a long training time for large chip designs. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel ML framework that integrates with CTMs to accelerate thermal simulations without the need for large datasets. We introduce a methodology that effectively combines the accuracy of CTMs with the efficiency of ML using a physically informed linear regression model based on the thermal conduction equation. We further introduce a window-based model reduction technique for scalability across a range of grid sizes and system architectures by reducing computational overhead without sacrificing accuracy. Unlike most of the existing ML methods for temperature prediction, our model adapts to changes in floorplans and architectures with minimum retraining. Experimental results show that our method achieves up to $70 \\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art thermal simulators and enables real-time, high-resolution thermal simulations on different IC designs from 2D to 3D.<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>This research was partially funded by the NSF CCF 2131127 grant"

While Gallium Nitride (GaN) and SiC devices outperform traditional silicon transistors, they present challenges related to parasitic-induced resonances during fast switching. Simulations and experiments highlight the impact of these parasitics, the importance of accurate modeling, and how gate resistance (Rg) affects power dissipation and system stability. Simulations of a half-bridge converter revealed that increasing Rg from 3Ω to 30Ω significantly reduced voltage oscillations and spikes, but increased the switching energy dissipation for the low-side (LS) transistor by five times. Strong oscillations, particularly at 24 MHz, were intensified by diode reverse recovery. Experimental comparisons between Si and SiC MOSFETs demonstrated that SiC devices exhibit significantly lower losses and superior thermal performance. Furthermore, current measurement methods, such as using a Hall-effect probe with a series wire, introduced additional parasitic inductances that compromised power estimation accuracy and caused oscillations, even with increased Rg. An increase in gate resistance to 30Ω doubled the power dissipation, affecting thermal stability under non-Zero Voltage Switching (non-ZVS) conditions. Minimizing parasitic inductance and increasing gate resistance were effective in mitigating oscillations"

The control law is based on state feedback, and an Unknown Input Observer is adopted to ensure robustness against disturbances, allowing the observed states to account for their effects. Even the main voltage can be estimated solely from the grid current sensor. Due to the presence of poles with purely imaginary components, some states of the plant are only detectable and not observable. Therefore, a discussion on how to address this condition using the state observer is proposed. Discussions on the necessary conditions for the observer implementation, along with its design criteria integrated with the control loop, are provided. Results based on hardware-in-the-loop platform is carried out to verify the proposed approach."

However, existing methods predominantly concentrate on design of foreground feature masks while neglecting the suppression of small-scale targets by dominant large-scale counterparts in cluttered backgrounds during the distillation, which severely degrades detection robustness. To address this, we propose scale-conscious knowledge distillation. Multi-scale feature distillation in this framework decouples the coupled feature in conventional methods into hierarchical multi-scale representation spaces, enabling the student model to capture cross-granularity features from micro-details to macro-structures through differentiated receptive fields. Scale-adaptive output distillation innovatively introduces a dynamic weighting mechanism based on the normalized object area, effectively alleviating the gradient vanishing issue for small objects. Experimental results show that our method consistently improves the performance of student models with different architectures on both the DOTA and DIOR datasets.

However, many existing algorithms necessitate a complex feature engineering process and domain knowledge. In this context, this work proposes a neural network-based approach, which eliminates the need for complicated hand-crafted features, using Gramian angular fields and leveraging possibly pre-trained convolutional neural networks. Therefore, we combine these tools to tackle the challenge of multiclass trajectory classification. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on an imbalanced dataset simulated with SUMO by classifying different means of transportation–private car, taxi, bus, pedestrian, motorcycle, bicycle–achieving good results in terms of accuracy and F1 score."

The present paper proposes an ultrasound-based, real-time, dynamic gesture recognition scheme to address these problems. The extraction of dynamic gesture features is achieved through the utilisation of the channel estimation matrix diagram (CEM-D), while algorithms designed for onset and motion detection ensure the accurate acquisition of features. The classification of gestures is accomplished through the utilization of a RepVGG network, which facilitates the construction of an end-to-end recognition system. On a dataset comprising ten kinds of daily dynamic gestures, the method achieves an accuracy of over 95% in environments with noise levels of 30 dB and 70 dB, and takes an average of 0.0483s for a single recognition, which is 0.00969s faster than the traditional gesture recognition method.

    "abstract": "In privacy-preserving mobile network transmission scenarios with heterogeneous client data, personalized federated learning methods that decouple feature extractors and classifiers have demonstrated notable advantages in enhancing learning capability. However, many existing approaches primarily focus on feature space consistency and classification personalization during local training, often neglecting the local adaptability of the extractor and the global generalization of the classifier. This oversight results in insufficient coordination and weak coupling between the components, ultimately degrading the overall model performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedeCouple, a federated learning method that balances global generalization and local adaptability at a fine-grained level. Our approach jointly learns global and local feature representations while employing dynamic knowledge distillation to enhance the generalization of personalized classifiers. We further introduce anchors to refine the feature space; their strict locality and non-transmission inherently preserve privacy and reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis proving that FedeCouple converges for nonconvex objectives, with iterates approaching a stationary point as the number of communication rounds increases. Extensive experiments conducted on five image-classification datasets demonstrate that FedeCouple consistently outperforms nine baseline methods in effectiveness, stability, scalability, and security. Notably, in experiments evaluating effectiveness, FedeCouple surpasses the best baseline by a significant margin of 4.3%."

    "abstract": "This study presents a theoretical framework for forecasting financial time series that exhibits both non-stationarity and long-range dependence (LRD). Existing fractional differencing (FD) techniques attempt to preserve long-memory properties but suffer from estimation bias, arbitrary truncation of the infinite FD series, and limited compatibility with modern machine learning (ML) workflows. We propose an Adaptive Fractional Differencing (AFD) method introducing three key innovations: (1) a hybrid two-stage estimation procedure combining wavelet-based Hurst exponent analysis with ridge-regularized optimization to yield stable and unbiased estimates of the FD parameter; (2) a data-driven, cross-validation-based truncation strategy replacing heuristic truncation rules by minimizing predictive risk, thereby preserving LRD while bounding approximation error; and (3) a design that supports joint tuning of differencing parameters and forecasting models within ML pipelines, enabling end-to-end optimization in high-dimensional settings. Although empirical testing is left for future work, the theoretical contributions of AFD offer a scalable and principled approach for financial time series modeling. By bridging classical time-series theory with modern ML practices, AFD provides a foundation for developing more accurate and robust forecasting systems in data-rich, complex financial environments."

The controller gains are adapted per-maneuver using a Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm, conditioned on vehicle velocity. The vehicle model, including tire–road interactions, is developed in MATLAB/Simulink-python. Simulation results show that the proposed method reduces lateral position RMSE by up to 28%, yaw RMSE by 20%, and maximum lateral deviation by 33% compared with fixed-gain TST-SMC, while lowering steering effort by about 6-10% across the tested velocity range. These improvements demonstrate that reinforcement learning–based adaptation enhances the robustness and efficiency of sliding mode control under diverse operating conditions."

Adjustable phase shift pilots (APSPs) are an effective technique to acquire channels with low overhead by exploiting channel sparsity. In this paper, we extend it to multiple groups and propose multi-group adjustable phase shift pilots (MAPSPs) to improve SE further. We first introduce a massive MIMO-OFDM system model and transform the conventional channel model in the space-frequency domain to the angle-delay domain, obtaining a sparse channel matrix. Then, we propose a method of generating MAPSPs through multiple basic sequences and investigate channel estimation processes. By analyzing the components of pilot interference, we elucidate the underlying mechanism by which interference affects MMSE estimation. Building upon this foundation, we demonstrate the benefit of phase scheduling in MAPSP channel estimation and establish the optimal design condition tailored for scheduling. Furthermore, we propose an implementation scheme based on Zadoff-Chu sequences that includes received signal pre-processing and pilot scheduling methods to mitigate pilot interference. Simulation results indicate that the MAPSP method achieves a lower mean square error (MSE) of estimation than APSP and significantly enhances SE in mobility scenarios."

    "abstract": "Parallel interleaved three-level (3L) inverters (PITIs) fed flywheel energy storage systems (FESSs) enable efficient energy conversion for high-power applications. However, PITIs suffer from neutral-point voltage oscillation (NPVO), zero-sequence circulating currents (ZSCCs), and common-mode voltage (CMV), which degrade harmonic quality and interfere with the FESS magnetic bearing control. To solve these issues and enhance output quality, this article proposes a hierarchically adaptive modulation strategy. In the first stage, a selection criterion is established within the integrated five-level (5L) plane to determine small vector combinations with low CMV and ZSCC slope. In the second stage, while maintaining an interleaved vector sequence, the dwell times of the selected vector combinations are optimized based on the neutral-point current behavior in the present switching cycle, achieving simultaneous mitigation of NPVO, ZSCC, and CMV. In the third stage, the residual imbalances of NPVO and ZSCC from the previous cycle are considered. By refining vector dwell times in the present cycle, an overcompensation strategy is introduced, enhancing the adaptability of the proposed strategy to dynamic and unbalanced operations. Finally, comparative experiments on a 300-kW PITI-fed FESS drive validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in simultaneously suppressing NPVO, ZSCC, and CMV."

    "abstract": "Optical remote sensing image dehazing presents significant challenges due to its extensive spatial scale and highly non-uniform haze distribution, which traditional single-image dehazing methods struggle to address effectively. While Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery offers inherently haze-free reference information for large-scale scenes, existing SAR-guided dehazing approaches face two critical limitations: the integration of SAR information often diminishes the quality of haze-free regions, and the instability of feature quality further exacerbates cross-modal domain shift. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DehazeMamba, a novel SAR-guided dehazing network built on a progressive haze decoupling fusion strategy. Our approach incorporates two key innovations: a Haze Perception and Decoupling Module (HPDM) that dynamically identifies haze-affected regions through SAR-optical difference analysis, and a Progressive Fusion Module (PFM) that mitigates domain shift through a two-stage fusion process based on feature quality assessment. To facilitate research in this domain, we present MRSHaze, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 8,000 pairs of temporally synchronized, precisely geo-registered SAR-optical images with high resolution and diverse haze conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DehazeMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 0.73 dB improvement in PSNR and substantial enhancements in downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation."

While prior works have mainly focused on RGB images, their assumptions and modeling strategies do not generalize well to hyperspectral images (HSI), which are inherently highdimensional and exhibit complex spectral structures. In this paper, we propose the first GCD framework tailored for HSI, introducing a prototype subspace modeling model to better capture class structure. Instead of learning a single prototype vector for each category as in existing methods such as SimGCD, we model each category using a set of basis vectors, forming a subspace representation that enables greater expressiveness and discrimination in a high-dimensional feature space. To guide the learning of such bases, we enforce two key constraints: (1) a basis orthogonality constraint that promotes inter-class separability, and (2) a reconstruction constraint that ensures each prototype basis can effectively reconstruct its corresponding class samples. Experimental results on real-world HSI demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCD methods, establishing a strong foundation for generalized category discovery in hyperspectral settings."

However, the existing static Digital Twin (DT) models struggled to adapt to dynamic construction environments which led to limit their effectiveness in detecting potential risks in real-time. Hence, this research proposes an Intelligent Adaptive DT-based Early Warning System (IADT-EWS) which integrates real-time IoT sensor data with predictive modeling to provide continuous monitoring, early warning and decision support. Initially, the data acquisition and integration are performed by using Internet of Thing (IoT) sensors to collect multi-source operational and environmental parameters. Then, the data is preprocessed with median filter for noise removal, linear interpolation for missing value imputation and min-max normalization to scale features respectively. Moreover, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed for feature extraction to reduce the dimensionality and then, an ADT model is employed by using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to dynamically predict operational states. Finally, the statistical anomaly detection generates early warnings and an interactive dashboard provides decision support with real-time alerts and risk visualization for ensuring safe jacking operations. The proposed IADT-EWS achieved better results in terms of accuracy (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 5. 3 2 \\%}$</tex>) than existing Mutual Information and Multilayer Perceptron (MI-MLP) model."

A hybrid strategy is proposed to ensure robustness against grid impedance variations, combining a Type-III controller and an active damping branch based on virtual impedance.

However, its numerous small bones limit marketability and make the deboning process labor-intensive and reliant on skilled workers. Despite increasing demand, no advanced technology has been developed to automate this process. This study presents a conceptual design for a CNC-based automated deboning system. The approach involves mapping the anatomical spine structure—grouped into dorsal, rib, ventral, and lateral sections—to generate a precise toolpath for deboning. A reference system based on fixed anatomical points is introduced to accommodate fish sizes ranging from 400 to 600 grams. This conceptual framework addresses key challenges in traditional deboning, such as labor shortages and inconsistent output, and lays the groundwork for technological innovation in milkfish processing.

    "abstract": "The data center industry is rapidly evolving with the development of advanced cooling technologies to accommodate increasing compute power densities. Air-cooling systems are nearing their limitations and are no longer sufficient to manage the high thermal design power (TDP) demands of modern applications such as artificial intelligence, neural networks, parallel processing, and high-performance computing. Single-phase liquid immersion cooling (SPLIC) has emerged as a promising solution, where entire servers are immersed in tanks filled with cooling fluid, allowing direct contact between all server components and the fluid for efficient heat dissipation. This approach necessitates a thorough assessment of material compatibility and the performance of system components in the immersion environment. This study investigates the impact of immersion fluids on the electrical, thermal and reliability performance of the power components in data center IT systems, specifically focusing on power modules. These power modules are essential components in servers to convert intermediate bus voltage (IBV) to regulated core point of load (POL) voltages requiring minimal conversion loss and fast transient response. It is therefore critical to ensure that power modules perform according to their design specifications under immersion cooling conditions. The study evaluates the performance of power modules with two varied package designs, in three different single-phase immersion fluids, each with distinct properties such as density, thermal conductivity, and specific heat capacity. The testing involved running the devices at a constant output load, starting at 10 A and increasing by 10 A increments up to 40 A, with each test lasting one hour. During each run, critical performance parameters such as junction temperature, input current, and output voltage were monitored. The devices were first benchmarked in air-cooled environment at room temperature and $\\mathbf{4 5}^{\\boldsymbol{\\circ}} \\mathbf{C}$. In-situ testing was subsequently conducted with the devices immersed in all three fluids at $45^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. Parametric data collected from the benchmarks and insitu tests were compared to characterize the performance and efficiency of the power modules in the immersion environment. Further, devices were also subjected to thermal aging at $80^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ for 336 hours in each immersion fluid, following the Open Compute Project (OCP) guidelines. Post thermal aging, tests were conducted in air cooled environment at room temperature. The results were compared with the initial benchmark results to assess the long-term impact of immersion fluids on the performance and efficiency of the power modules. The notable findings of this study highlights that the devices demonstrated improved thermal performance at higher power while maintaining consistent efficiency during in-situ testing, compared to the benchmarking results at $\\mathbf{4 5}^{\\circ} \\mathbf{C}$. Furthermore, the long-term fluid impact assessment revealed that after prolonged exposure to more extreme conditions, the devices continued to exhibit comparable thermal performance without any reduction in efficiency across all output load levels."

    "abstract": "It is well known that pin-fin arrays can significantly improve the convective heat transfer of air-cooled heat sinks due to a large surface area enhancement from the fins. Such pin-fin heat sink designs serve as a promising solution for addressing a wide range of electronic device thermal management needs in both computing and energy conversion applications. However, air movers (e.g., axial fans or centrifugal pumps) that are used to drive and control air flow typically generate noise that tends to have spectral characteristics with specific resonances in the general range of 100 Hz to 10 kHz. Often it is desirable to attenuate such noise using additional sound absorbers, ducting, or grills. Here, we numerically investigate heat sinks with hybrid pin-fin/absorber-fin array designs subject to air jet impingement that simultaneously address heat transfer and noise attenuation. For the hybrid-fin array, Helmholtz resonators are employed for acoustic absorber fins that are then interleaved with more traditional heat sink pin fins whose phononic characteristics are not often discussed for noise mitigation. Through numerical studies, it is shown that the designed acoustic absorber fins effectively reduce the noise level at target frequencies over an acoustic spectrum that mimics a representative rotating axial fan. We further demonstrate that these frequencies can be changed by varying geometrical parameters of the hybrid pin-fin/absorber-fin array. Regarding heat transfer, thermal-fluid conjugate models are utilized to quantify the performance of a standard pin-fin heat sink versus the hybrid pin-fin/absorber-fin heat sink design. Our findings open new possibilities for further optimizing multifunctional hybrid-fin array-based heat sinks considering both thermal and acoustic performance."

    "abstract": "Accurate power estimation is essential for optimizing digital circuit design in modern VLSI systems. This study employs machine learning techniques, specifically ridge regression and linear regression models, to predict power consumption based on circuit characteristics. The dataset includes various digital circuits with key parameters such as the number of cells, I/O ports, nets, area, and multiple power metrics, including leakage, internal, net, dynamic switching, and total power. Feature analysis is conducted to identify the most significant contributors to power consumption. The proposed ridge regression-based approach outperforms linear regression by effectively handling multicollinearity and providing more stable predictions. Compared to traditional estimation methods, ridge regression demonstrates high prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, making it a suitable choice for realtime power analysis. The results indicate that machine learning, particularly regularized regression techniques, can significantly enhance power-aware design automation, enabling faster and more efficient optimization of digital circuits.

The proposed topology is characterized by its capability to operate with low current and voltage ripples at both the input and output, where the ripple frequency is four times higher than the switching frequency. Additionally, the currents in the inductors and capacitors are twice higher than the switching frequency, contributing to ripple reduction and enabling the use of smaller passive components. The converter also exhibits lower component stress, reduced magnetic element volume, and significantly lower losses due to its compact four-arm structure utilizing only two inductors.

This study reports laboratory measurements of EURO efficiency for eight commercial grid-connected PV inverters, executed in accordance with IEC 62891:2020, and compares them with manufacturers' declarations. Conformity is assessed using two acceptance models: the variable tolerance of IEC 61683:1999 and the fixed 1 percentage-point (p.p.) tolerance of Brazilian Ordinance No. 140/2022. For all devices, the measured EURO efficiency is lower than the declared value; the mean declared-measured gap is 1.68 p.p. (range: 0.66-2.80 p.p.). No device complies with IEC 61683, and only one tested device complies under Ordinance 140. These results indicate that datasheet efficiencies are systematically optimistic. For design and performance projections, a conservative specification is recommended: for each device, use the smaller of the laboratory-measured EURO value and the guaranteed minimum."

As the complexity and volatility of financial settings intensify, adequate risk assessment has become fundamental to safeguard capital resources and drive long-term prosperity. Conventional frameworks varying from statistical methods to basic heuristic approaches are inadequate to properly capture the nonlinear, dynamic, and multi-dimensional character of enterprise risk. In return, machine learning approaches and bio-inspired algorithms have been embraced for improved predictability as well as adaptability. These existing techniques are, however, subject to slow convergence, local optima trap, and poor generalization for a wide range of financial situations. Further, dependence on single-algorithm techniques achieves low performance when addressed to high-dimensional and time-changing data sets typical of enterprise market data. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, this research advances a Hybrid Bio-Inspired Model that leverages synergies of the best features of cutting-edge nature-inspired with deep learning models. Performance metrices measures showed excellent results with accuracy of 96%, precision of 95.6%, recall of 96.4%, and an F1-score of 95.6%. The suggested system improves exploration-exploitation balance, speeds up convergence, and enhances the accuracy of risk categorization.

Traditional air-cooling methods are no longer sufficient to meet the needs of modern CPUs and GPUs, which generate significant thermal loads at power densities that push the boundaries of current cooling technologies. This study presents an integrated approach combining Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and experimental analysis to develop optimized cold plate designs using Electrochemical Additive Manufacturing (ECAM). The study focuses on cooling high-powered chips with non-uniform power distribution under Thermal Design Power (TDP) loads of 700 W, using a coolant inlet temperature of $45^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. CFD simulations were employed to explore and optimize various cold plate geometries, targeting minimal thermal resistance and enhanced heat dissipation across the chip. The ECAM-based cold plates, with their capability to produce highly intricate and customized internal flow structures with high resolutions on the micro scale, were found to offer superior thermal performance compared to conventional straight microchannel cold plates. The best-performing cold plate designs from the CFD simulations were fabricated using ECAM technology and subsequently tested experimentally. The result of this study indicates that the ECAM-manufactured cold plates exhibited 21% lower thermal resistance and achieved a 201% improvement in thermal uniformity compared to the baseline by significantly reducing the temperature gradient and improved temperature uniformity across the chip, outperforming traditional straight microchannel cold plate designs. This study demonstrates the potential of ECAM for fabricating cold plates with complex geometries, providing a significant step forward in thermal management solutions for next-generation high-powered chips and electronics cooling."

In this study, we develop and demonstrate a general design framework for two-dimensional (2D) and 3D heat spreading/removal solutions using multigrid topological optimization methods coupled with sensitivity analysis to achieve efficient optimal design. We begin with an efficient steady-state heat conduction finite element solution using a sparse solver. We then combine the solver with a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) optimizer for workload-specific heat spreader topology design as well as optimized placement of through silicon vias (TSVs) to enable heat removal through the 3D chip stack. Topology optimization is performed using the solid isotropic material with penalization method (SIMP), which iteratively modifies the effective thermal conductivity to optimize material distribution. We also implement a semi-analytical sensitivity analysis to ensure efficient derivative calculation necessary for optimization. The developed multigrid optimization method first optimizes material distribution on a coarse mesh to reduce computation time followed by a refined solution to achieve the same level of accuracy as a direction solution using fine mesh but with less computational cost. This developed multigrid topological optimization framework significantly speeds up the optimization process without loss of accuracy in generating three-dimensional heat removal solutions. Three examples are solved to illustrate the developed method: (1) optimized heat spreader material distribution given heat sources (2) optimized location of thermal vias on a grid for a given power map and (3) optimal die arrangement and via placement in a 3D stack."

    "abstract": "The surge in demand, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and the Internet of Things (IoT), has resulted in an unprecedented growth in transistor density for high-end CPUs and GPUs. The increasing computational demands in modern data centers have led to the widespread adoption of direct-to-chip cold plate-based liquid cooling systems to efficiently manage heat dissipation with high-performance computing equipment. Various single phase coolants such as glycol based, water-based, and nano fluids were introduced in the market to meet the requirements. These coolants, produced by different manufacturers, incorporate diverse inhibitors and chemical additives designed to enhance long-term performance, prevent bio-growth, and offer robust corrosion resistance. Corrosion in liquid cooling systems is a significant concern for the reliability and longevity of equipment within data centers, evaluating the effectiveness of these coolants becomes critical. This study aims to assess the corrosion performance of various coolant formulations used in data center liquid cooling loops, utilizing standardized methods such as ASTM D1384 and ASTM D8040 to evaluate their impact on common wetted materials like copper, brass, stainless steel 304 and stainless steel 316. The ASTM D1384 standard outlines a method to evaluate the corrosiveness of engine coolants under controlled conditions. In this test, coupons made of materials commonly used in cooling systems-such as copper, brass, steel, cast iron, cast aluminum, and solderare immersed in a coolant-water solution and subjected to aeration at an elevated temperature ($88^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$) for a specified duration. Corrosion behavior is assessed by measuring the weight loss of these coupons before and after testing, with the results compared to the acceptable ASTM limits. In contrast, the ASTM D8040 standard is tailored specifically for evaluating coolants in data center environments, considering unique operational conditions such as lower flow rates and extended life cycle demands. In this study, several commercial coolant formulations, including propylene glycol-based coolants and water-based coolants designed specifically for data center cooling systems, were tested. Coupon sets composed of four materials were meticulously prepared, cleaned, and weighed before immersion in coolant solutions as per ASTM specifications. The solutions were maintained at an elevated temperature and aerated to simulate accelerated operating conditions The results of the study revealed significant differences in the corrosion resistance provided by the various coolant formulations. It was evident that the performance of corrosion inhibitors played a crucial role in the protection of materials within liquid cooling systems. This study highlights the critical importance of corrosion inhibitors in safeguarding essential materials and stresses the need for diligent testing and monitoring of coolant formulations to ensure optimal operational efficiency and the durability of cooling equipment. The findings underscore the necessity for data center operators to carefully select coolants that prevent corrosion, thereby reducing maintenance costs and extending equipment lifespan."

    "abstract": "In the era of extreme scaling of nanoscale devices, the increasing packing density of Advanced Common Multigate Transistors (ACMTs) in modern Integrated Circuits (ICs) has led to significantly higher power densities. Additionally, the self-heating effect in ACMTs, primarily due to their gate-all-around (GAA) structure, exacerbates thermal challenges. The low thermal conductivity of gate oxide materials traps heat in the channel, resulting in a worsened thermal profile, particularly for technology nodes below 14 nm. This thermal stress directly affects device reliability, contributing to issues such as Temperature Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB), Negative/Positive Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI/PBTI), and Hot Carrier Degradation (HCD). These reliability concerns raise serious questions about the sustainability of modern ICs under such thermal conditions. This work proposes a parameterized Thermal Compact Model (TCM) for ACMTs (including Nanosheet, Forksheet, and Complementary FETs) to improve thermal management in ICs. The approach divides the device into temperature nodes, based on hotspots identified through Finite-Element Method (FEM) simulations. An equivalent thermal RC circuit is then modeled, using design and structural parameters, allowing the model to be adaptable to various types of multigate transistors. The proposed TCM’s thermal DC and frequency responses are validated through Synopsys(c) TCAD tools, ensuring accuracy and effectiveness in managing the thermal behavior of advanced ICs."

    "abstract": "In archery, stable form is crucial for high scores, but archers often struggle to perceive body tilt in real-time. This study proposes a system providing immediate visual feedback on body inclination near the target during the aiming phase. A within-subjects experiment with nine intermediate archers showed the system improved body tilt, and this effect persisted even after feedback removal. Subjective usability evaluations were highly positive."

    "abstract": "We present the game \"DriveQuest\", targeting in-car gamification for drivers and passengers. It consists of two connected applications: A gamified navigation application on the car’s infotainment display for the driver and a phone application for passengers. The aim is to collect badges by driving to Points of Interest (POIs), supported by features that utilize real-time vehicle signals. The phone application provides an Augmented Reality (AR) mini-game, guiding the passengers towards POIs in a seamless experience that also fosters collaboration. A user study was conducted with pairs of participants (driver and one passenger). Data was collected via questionnaires, real-time logging, and observations. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the potential of the prototype as an educational and entertainment tool while also examining their stance on the features. The System Usability Scale (SUS) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaires revealed a positive user experience, with drivers reporting lower scores overall. The AR feature was appreciated, with challenges remaining. The current moderate potential for day-to-day use needs to be addressed. We conclude by providing recommendations and a discussion on future research in the area of in-car gamification involving AR while driving."

    "abstract": "We present a multispectral extension to 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for wavelength-aware view synthesis. Each Gaussian is augmented with spectral radiance, represented via per-band spherical harmonics, and optimized under a dual-loss supervision scheme combining RGB and multispectral signals. To improve rendering fidelity, we perform spectral-to-RGB conversion at the pixel level, allowing richer spectral cues to be retained during optimization. Our method is evaluated on both public and self-captured real-world datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements over the RGB-only 3DGS baseline in terms of image quality and spectral consistency. Notably, it excels in challenging scenes involving translucent materials and anisotropic reflections. The proposed approach maintains the compactness and real-time efficiency of 3DGS while laying the foundation for future integration with physically based shading models."

    "abstract": "Three phase imbalance is the typical power quality problem in the distribution networks, which is generally caused by imbalanced active and reactive loads on each phase. Conventionally, additional hardware such as Static Var Generator (SVG) and Active Power Filter (APF) are installed to handle this issue at the cost of increased investment. However, the widely installed three-phase voltage source converter has similar circuit structure and considerable potential in phase balancing. This paper proposes a novel split-phase power control strategy for the three-phase Voltage Source Converter (VSC) via negative-sequence current injection, which achieves independent regulation of the average power of each individual phase so that the VSC can participate in inter-phase imbalance compensation. The single-phase power expression is first derived in the phasor domain considering the positive- and negative-sequence components. Then, to handle the freedom-degree-lacking dilemma, two schemes are proposed to achieve split-phase active or reactive power regulation while keeping the other power constant, respectively. After that, the implementation method into the classic VSC control frame is introduced. Finally, the validness of the control strategy and the effectiveness of the phase power balancing have been well proved by simulation results."

Providing adaptive and personalized test materials ensures that learners receive resources suited to their proficiency levels. This research presents a Personalized Curriculum Recommendation System utilizing Fine-Tuned BERT to capture contextual semantics in test materials and learner profiles. Despite progress in AI-driven educational recommendations, existing methods often struggle to accurately align resources with individual proficiency levels, leading to inefficient learning experiences. To address these challenges, this study proposes a learning framework that leverages Finetuned BERT-based sentence embeddings and cosine similarity ranking for test material selection. Key linguistic features, including semantic coherence and contextual embeddings, enhance recommendation accuracy. The proposed system achieves a recommendation accuracy of 97 % with Precision of 97.5), Recall of 96.75, and F1-Score (96.2%), validating its effectiveness and reliability. Experimental results demonstrate the system's superiority in optimizing test preparation, outperforming rule-based approaches. These findings highlight the impact of AI-powered recommendation systems in education, enhancing personalized learning pathways, student engagement, and proficiency development.

    "abstract": "Although haptic technologies that allow users to touch virtual objects have been actively studied, they have not yet seen widespread adoption in real-world applications. To facilitate broader adoption, it is essential to design stimuli that elicit pleasant sensations during active interactions with virtual objects. However, how such pleasantness can be effectively induced remains poorly understood. This work-in-progress study investigates whether perceived pleasantness is postdictively modulated by the visual appearance of objects. We conducted a case study in a task where users manipulated a pointer to press and penetrate a virtual membrane. In the experiment, we manipulated visual parameters (i.e., the natural frequency and damping ratio) of the membrane during its recovery phase after penetration. We also varied the resistance force experienced during the pressing phase. Preliminary results suggest that natural frequency as a visual parameter contributed to the perception of pleasantness across force conditions. Based on these findings, which provide valuable insights into designing haptic interactions that elicit pleasantness, we plan to proceed with the main experiment. These insights may help advance the broader adoption of haptic technologies in real-world applications."

(2) A weighted gesture scoring model that prioritizes motion components most relevant to the therapeutic objectives of each exercise. Modular game-play allows reconfiguration according to clinical prescriptions for various conditions, including Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, post-stroke upper limb recovery, and rotator cuff rehabilitation.

In the feedback channel, an ILADRC is developed by introducing a derivative state variable of the total disturbance into the extended state observer, thereby enhancing the system's torque tracking accuracy. The effectiveness of the composite controller is validated through simulation studies.

To address these limitations, ReflectPort is introduced as a novel teleportation technique that leverages natural reflection-inspired physics to streamline teleportation within complex virtual environments. This technique allows teleportation paths to bounce off surfaces while previewing the destination, enabling users to navigate around corners, handle elevation changes, and bypass spatial obstacles more effectively."

Based on this, this paper proposes a method for measuring the blade-tower clearance based on the deformation estimation of blade and tower. The proposed method first constructs the motion equations of the blade and the tower based on the beam element theory, and then combines the solved modal matrix with the horn lizard optimization algorithm(HLOA) to optimize the installation scheme of the displacement sensor. Then, based on the sensor installation scheme, the blade-tower state space equation is constructed and the deformation is estimated using kalman filter(KF). Finally, the estimated deformation is mapped into the blade-tower clearance using radial basis function(RBF). A 5MW wind turbine is used in experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Large language models have improved conversational AI by producing fluent, context-aware replies. Still, their short context windows and lack of persistent memory can break conversations: users often must repeat important details. This gap harms personalization and makes it hard for systems to keep a consistent, long-term dialogue. This paper tackles that problem by developing memory extraction and retrieval methods to capture and preserve important user information from conversations. The proposed system extracts compact facts—user preferences, notable events, and situational details—and stores them in a structured repository. Those facts are converted into semantic vectors through modern vectorization (embedding) techniques, which enable fast, similarity-based lookup. During a conversation, the system retrieves relevant memory vectors and injects the matching information into the model’s context. That dynamic retrieval enriches the model’s input with past, relevant details, improving response coherence and personalization without changing the language model itself. Evaluation shows that this memory-augmented pipeline effectively adds high -similarity and usable context to the models."

    "abstract": "Constructing a sentiment-embedded event evolutionary graph (SEEGraph) is proposed to capture the dynamic relationships and narratives embedded in the oral histories of diasporas. It provides data support for applying diaspora oral archives knowledge and realizes the effective transformation of “data-knowledge-application”. Firstly, diaspora oral archives are introduced as the research scope. Secondly, domain ontology is utilized to build a knowledge representation system for diaspora oral archives. Based on the ontology, events, and event relations are defined to construct SEEGraph. Next, the South Asian Oral History Project (SAOHP) is selected as the data source. Events entities and relationships involved in the diaspora oral archives are extracted with Natural language processing (NLP) tools, which form the data layer of the event evolutionary map. SEEGraph is then constructed. This step stores and maps instances extracted from archival data, transforming data into knowledge. Finally, the knowledge graph is applied to analyze and explore the event evolutionary patterns, spatio-temporal and spatio-sentiment rules of historical events, and emotional changes of diasporas. This innovative methodology not only provides valuable insights into the experiences, identities, and connections of diaspora members but also offers a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex interplay between mobility and belonging in diaspora oral archives."

    "abstract": "We extend intersection types to a computational λ-calculus with algebraic operations à la Plotkin and Power. We achieve this by considering monadic intersections—whereby computational effects appear not only in the operational semantics, but also in the type system. Since in the effectful setting termination is not anymore the only property of interest, we want to analyze the interactive behavior of typed programs with the environment. Indeed, our type system is able to characterize the natural notion of observation, both in the finite and in the infinitary setting. In a second phase, we extend our system with subtyping to incorporate a richer class of effects via monads on preorders instead of sets allowing us to model in particular non-determinism. The main technical tool is a novel combination of syntactic techniques with abstract relational reasoning, which allows us to lift all the required notions, e.g. of typability and logical relation, to the monadic setting."

    "abstract": "Denoising is a core operation in modern video pipelines. In codecs, in-loop filters suppress sensor noise and quantisation artefacts to improve rate-distortion performance; in cinema post-production, denoisers are used for restoration, grain management, and plate clean-up. However, state-of-the-art deep denoisers are computationally intensive and, at scale, are typically deployed on GPUs, incurring high power and cost for real-time, high-resolution streams. This paper presents Real-Time Denoise (ReTiDe), a hardware-accelerated denoising system that serves inference on data-centre Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). A compact convolutional model is quantised (post-training quantisation plus quantisation-aware fine-tuning) to INT8 and compiled for AMD Deep Learning Processor Unit (DPU)-based FPGAs. A client-server integration offloads computation from the host CPU/GPU to a networked FPGA service, while remaining callable from existing workflows, e.g., NUKE, without disrupting artist tooling. On representative benchmarks, ReTiDe delivers 37.71 × Giga Operations Per Second (GOPS) throughput and 5.29 × higher energy efficiency than prior FPGA denoising accelerators, with negligible degradation in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)/Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). These results indicate that specialised accelerators can provide practical, scalable denoising for both encoding pipelines and post-production, reducing energy per frame without sacrificing quality or workflow compatibility.

    "abstract": "Phantom track jamming is an important branch of radar deception jamming. Research on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory planning for phantom track generation (PTG) is challenged by the high-dimensional solution space, non-differentiable objective function, and complex constraints. Existing PTG methods do not incorporate electromagnetic constraints, employ online one-step optimization, and can only generate limited types of phantom tracks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based PTG method. In this paper, we formulate PTG as a Markov decision process, incorporate the electromagnetic constraints, and develop the first offline multi-step optimization method for PTG. Additionally, a state data preprocessing technique is introduced to achieve translation and scaling invariance of scenario features, significantly reducing the learning cost while enhancing policy generalization capability. Three representative scenarios are used to visually demonstrate the superiority of the DRL-based PTG method. Furthermore, numerous experiments are conducted to statistically validate the competitiveness of the proposed method in terms of computational speed and phantom track completeness."

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, urban traffic congestion has become one of the most critical situations in current cities, causing significant travel delays, energy waste, and environmental impacts. However, traditional methods often faced various challenges including unstable communication between intersections, and lack of robustness in dynamic traffic situations. To overcome these challenges, this research proposes a decentralized traffic signal control framework based on MultiAgent Graph Reinforcement Learning (MAGRL) which improved with a Neighbor State Predictor (NSP) and a confidence-based fallback. Moreover, each traffic light works as a smart agent that not only observes local settings but also predicts neighboring states when communication is late, ensuring dependable decision-making. Additionally, a graph convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) module was utilized to jointly capture spatial correlations across intersections and temporal variations in traffic flow, while the boosted Aggregated Advantage Actor-Critic with Neighbor State Predictor (Agg-A2C-NSP) minimized control policies. Finally, the experimental evaluation of real-world data from Monaco specifies that the proposed method highly minimizes the average trip delay to 500 ms, outperforming existing baselines and highlighting its potential for scalable and communicationresilient urban traffic management."

The proposed converter offers key advantages, including reduced current and voltage ripple at the input and output ports, achieved through a ripple frequency that is six times higher than the switching frequency. Additionally, the size of magnetic components and capacitors is significantly reduced due to a ripple frequency that is twice the switching frequency, resulting in minimized power losses, reduced stress on power components, and enhanced efficiency. The PWM-based multiarm technique simplifies the converter's structure by eliminating the need for inductors proportional to the number of arms, yielding a compact, lightweight, and cost-effective design. The proposed converter is suitable for electric mobility applications, such as in battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), enabling efficient energy management among the various subsystems of the powertrain.

    "abstract": "Federated learning emerges as a key enabler toward pervasive intelligence across IoT ecosystems with provable privacy guarantees. While recent efforts on client selection have been made for optimizing its communication efficiency in iterative model aggregation over resource-constrained networks, their scalability fundamentally breaks down in dense deployments. This limitation stems from the NP-hard complexity of congestion-aware scheduling, where co-channel interference creates exponentially growing solution spaces. In this context, we present a novel client selection framework with asymptotic scalability in massive IoT, which leverages the intrinsic graph topology with insights from statistical physics. First, this work formulate a universal client selection problem, capturing both positive network externalities derived from collaborative knowledge exchange and congestion effects induced by co-channel interference. This formulation is then transformed into a node classification task via Ising spin Hamiltonian mapping, establishing an explicit connection between federated learning, statistical physics, and graph optimization. Building on this foundation, we develop a lightweight graph neural solver that adaptively selects clients via recognizing node state with iterative neighbor aggregation of learnable embeddings. Comprehensive experiments validate that our approach maintains state-of-the-art scheduling performance, while scaling to network sizes orders of magnitude beyond what conventional methods can handle."

This work addresses the signal processing challenges associated with data detection in THz-band mimo systems. We begin by analyzing the trade-offs between performance and complexity across various detection schemes and THz channel models, demonstrating significant complexity reduction by leveraging spatial parallelism across subspaces of correlated, typically ill-conditioned THz mimo channels. We also derive accurate theoretical bounds on the detection error probability by incorporating THz-specific channel distributions and accounting for mismatches introduced by subspace decomposition. In addition, we propose a variation of subspace detectors that combines channel-matrix sorting, QR decomposition, and puncturing. Furthermore, under wideband THz UM-MIMO systems, we introduce a channel-matrix reuse strategy that minimizes exhaustive computations while maintaining reliable detection performance within a coherence bandwidth. Simulations over accurate THz channels show that the proposed efficient spatial parallelization schemes yield multi-dB performance gains, while the proposed reuse strategy offers significant computational savings with minimal performance degradation."

In particular, eight cylindrical samples have been analyzed with a short-circuited coaxial line to measure the radial, longitudinal, and transverse components of the complex dielectric permittivity tensor at microwave frequencies, extracting the corresponding Debye models. The measured dielectric properties have also been compared with those of other tree species, available in the scientific literature. Moreover, the physical–chemical profile of the trunk has been defined, with particular reference to the moisture content, a fundamental factor that influences the dielectric properties. Moreover, the ash content of the same samples has been analyzed, and both the thermal gravimetric analysis and the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy have been performed to further characterize the considered tree."

However, their accuracy declines for eccentric gaze targets due to the common assumption of a spherical cornea. Here, we present the first integration of the Navarro aspherical cornea model into stereoscopic eye-tracking algorithms. We evaluated our approach through simulations and experimental data from a 350 Hz stereoscopic eye-tracking system. Simulations demonstrated a significant reduction in gaze estimation error for eccentric targets, with accuracy improvements up to ±1.3°. In real world validation, the aspherical model reduced noise and improved precision to a level comparable with that of a high-end eye-tracking system (EyeLink 1000 Plus). Accuracy gains were not found, probably due to the limited measurement range. Our results indicate that aspherical cornea modeling can enhance the precision and potential clinical use of stereoscopic eye-tracking, particularly for applications involving eccentric gaze positions. Future research should explore extended measurement ranges to fully realize the benefits of this approach."

    "abstract": "This study proposes a method for estrus prediction in sows using object detection and convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) models. Previous estrus prediction models have exhibited inconsistent performance due to variations in posture-transition event frequency and ambiguity in detecting transitions. We observed that when a sow changes its posture once, multiple detections of posture changes often occur, leading to an abnormally high frequency of events. To address this issue, the time-series data were resampled at uniform intervals. The resampled time-series data were processed using a double moving average, which served as the input for the prediction model. In 142 of 175 sows, the activity level during the 24 h preceding the estrus detection point by farm managers showed an increasing trend compared with the previous time period. This observed activity trend is consistent with the behavioral characteristics of sows during estrus reported in previous studies. Estrus prediction using the newly constructed time-series data and CRNN model achieved an accuracy of approximately 86%. The proposed method is expected to facilitate more efficient estrus prediction in pig farms, thereby reducing the associated costs and labor."

In order to address the above challenges, the variable switching duty ratio-based DTC was introduced in the literature for healthy operation.

    "abstract": "The dependable functioning of thermal regulation systems is crucial to facilitating high-performance computation for the future. As more energy-dense racks materialize to accommodate higher computational demands, the air cooling systems struggle with inefficiency, thermal hot-spots, and increased energy consumption. Conversely, liquid cooling is emerging as a viable solution to address the constraints of air cooling technology. This scholarly article focuses on investigating diverse methodologies to evaluate the reliability and availability of cooling systems for a liquid-cooled data center. The system under examination in this manuscript is a rack-level system, encompassing components within the secondary loop. The sole innovative element examined in this investigation is a two-phase liquid cold-plate, whereas all other elements are conventional. The cold plate is innovative in its architecture due to its capability to segregate the liquid and vapor as it undergoes boiling. Notably, the wick configuration diminishes the total pumping energy requisite. The additional novel aspect is the methodology that encompasses a comprehensive evaluation of the reliability of liquid-cooled data centers. A thorough investigation into the reliability modeling of liquid cooling systems is highly necessary. This necessity arises from the demand for the adaptation of liquid cooling systems to accommodate the escalating requirements for power-dense racks. A technologically advanced solution does not attain significance until it is deemed reliable and adaptable. In our investigation, we present a meticulous examination of the reliability of a particular liquid cooling system and underscore the establishment of a methodology to assess and ascertain the reliability, which is presently deficient in the extant literature.In this investigation, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of various stochastic models that are utilized to forecast reliability. Subsequently, we examine the correlation between system availability and the reliability of a novel component that has been assimilated into the system. In the instance of a liquid-cooled cold plate, we delineate the specific failure modes that the system may manifest. We employ the traditionally utilized Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to facilitate this evaluation. In particular, three failure modes-Erosion, Corrosion, and Clogging-are carefully assessed within this discussion. We outline multiple highly effective models that are currently accessible for the quantification of these failure modes. The findings from the analysis reveal the variables that significantly contribute to each of the failure modes investigated in this study."

It has already been used widely in industrial automation, autonomous vehicles, and service robotics. This essay will compare the performances of two classical obstacle avoidance algorithms which are Artificial Potential Field (APF) and Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) by using the PUMA560 robotic arm model. By building a system with the same static obstacles. The performances of these two algorithms are evaluated through quantitative metrics including the final position accuracy, path smoothness, and time costs. The result of the experiment shows that APF performs well with higher efficiency and smoother path of avoidance, however, this method would be disturbed by the parameters adjusting. While RRT shows robustness in complex environment but the of path of the motion is not as smooth as that of the APF, and it is more time consuming. Parameter sensitivity analysis shows the influence of parameters on the final performance. Based on these findings, engineers may need to consider more while selecting them in different situations."

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for high-performance electric motors, driven by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles, necessitates effective thermal management techniques. Efficient dissipation of heat generated in the copper windings is critical for the safety, efficiency, and reliability of electric motors. Heat must be transferred from the current-carrying copper windings to the metallic stator body through an electrically insulating material called the slot liner. But little research has focused on the interactions between the slot liner and the windings in the statorslot liner-winding assembly in terms of dissipating heat from the windings. This study examines the impact of compression of the slot liner on the thermal resistance across the statorwinding assembly considering two common slot liner materials: Nomex<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">®</sup>410 and Kapton<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">®</sup> MT+. To do so, we developed a mock stator-winding assembly by stacking a rigid, grooved copper piece that mimics the windings, the slot liner, and a rigid silicon piece that imitates the stator, along with a reference material used to quantify heat flow through the assembly. Steady-state temperature gradients are established across the stack, and the resulting two-dimensional temperature maps are captured using infrared (IR) microscopy and analyzed to calculate the total thermal resistance across the assembly. Tests are repeated at several levels of compression and with increasing compression, the area-normalized thermal resistance of the winding-stator interface with a Nomex<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">®</sup>410 slot liner decreases by $\\mathbf{1 4. 9 \\%}$ (from 94 to $80 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} \\mathrm{~K} / \\mathrm{W}$) and with Kapton<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">®</sup> MT+ decreases by 68.0% (from 50 to $16 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} \\mathrm{~K} / \\mathrm{W}$). Ultimately, this research provides insight into the effects of slot liner material and compression level on the thermal management of electric motors and provides guidance on optimum system configuration. Reducing the total thermal resistance of the stator-winding assembly can reduce temperatures within the windings, which, in turn, improves the longevity and efficiency of the motor."

Firstly, in the backbone network, the original Conv module is replaced with an average pooling downsampling Adown convolution module, ensuring lightweight operations while retaining key information to enhance detection performance. Secondly, detail enhancement convolution is integrated into the C3k2 module to construct C3k2_DEConv, improving the model's ability to better restore and preserve image detail information and texture details during feature extraction.

Key contributions include the development of flux-switching permanent magnet generators (FSPMG), where rotor-mounted configurations and optimized stator-rotor geometries enhance electric loading and reduce torque ripple. In axial flux machines, axial flux permanent magnet generators (AFPMG) are shown to outperform conventional radial flux counterparts in low-speed, low-power scenarios due to superior electromagnetic characteristics and structural efficiency. Induction generators are also revisited with improvements, such as brushless doubly-fed configurations and dual-stator topologies offering robust, cost-effective alternatives for variable-speed operations. Furthermore, high-temperature superconducting (HTS) generators are explored for large-scale wind energy systems, addressing the challenge of AC losses while offering near-zero resistance and high current density. The integration of HTS materials in axial flux configurations is proposed as a future direction for achieving compact, high-performance generators. The study underscores the potential of distributed small-scale power generation using advanced low-cost axial flux and superconducting designs, promoting microgrid implementation. Collectively, these developments represent significant progress towards next-generation generator solutions tailored to the evolving demands of sustainable energy systems."

    "abstract": "The widespread use of PFAS in electronic packaging poses environmental and health risks due to their persistence. Detectable PFAS in water and food, along with health effects, highlight the need for alternatives. While PFAS are crucial in electronics, their impact extends beyond product life cycles. Regulations may phase them out, challenging the industry to find non-PFAS solutions. The interconnected supply chain amplifies this impact. Developing alternatives is vital for reducing e-waste and protecting future generations, making research into nonPFAS materials essential for sustainable electronics.This paper outlines a methodology for assessing the impact of hydrothermal aging on non-PFAS semiconductor electronic packaging materials. The primary focus of this study involves the examination of thermal conductivity for TIMs in its initial state (pristine samples). Additionally, the research delves into the consequences of prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures and humidity on various thermal interfacial materials (TIMs), exploring the aging process. The Arrhenius Equation is also applied to evaluate the aging effect and the temperature effect on activation energy. Activation energy and the evolution of time exponents are reported. While the detrimental effects of PFAS are well-documented, the existing research landscape lacks comprehensive exploration and viable alternatives in electronic packaging. The dearth of non-PFAS solutions in electronic design and fabrication poses a critical gap, especially considering the impending regulatory measures aimed at eliminating PFAS from consumer products. This deficiency is exacerbated by the interconnected nature of the electronics supply chain, where any regulatory action would reverberate across all levels, from individual components to complete electronic systems. This research investigates the mechanical and thermal properties evolution of a number of non-PFAs TIMs when subjected to longterm, high-temperature and humidity exposure. The study explores the thermal conductivity evolution of TIMs in high temperature and humidity environments ($85 \\mathrm{C} 85 \\% \\mathrm{RH}$) and (60 C $60 \\% \\mathrm{RH})$ for 164 hours. The results will compare with the existing data of non-PFAs, UFs and TIMs."

    "abstract": "Efficient thermal management is critical for highpower electronics, with microchannel cooling providing enhanced heat dissipation in compact designs. Conventional topology optimisation (TO) methods often fail to capture fine-scale features without relying on extremely fine meshes, leading to high computational costs. This study proposes a homogenisationbased TO framework integrated with an on-the-fly phasorbased dehomogenisation technique. The phasor-based method efficiently maps homogenised designs to fine-scale microchannel networks, maintaining continuous variations in channel properties and improving robustness while reducing computational expense compared to the conventional projection-based method. An idealised two-dimensional chip with heterogeneous heat generation is used to demonstrate the integrated design workflow. The homogenisation-based TO is performed on a coarse $50 \\times 50 \\mathrm{mesh}$, with the phasor-based dehomogenisation reconstructing fine-scale microchannel networks on a $3213 \\times 3213$ mesh. The results show that the framework achieves a three orders-of-magnitude reduction in computational cost compared to hypothetical brute-force full-scale optimisation and a $\\mathbf{3 5. 3} \\%$ improvement in thermal performance over traditional pin-fin designs (the initial guess). Limitations of the current study, such as refining the homogenisation model and incorporating irregular meshes, point to promising directions for future investigations."

    "abstract": "Accurate weather state classification is crucial for applications in solar energy, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. This study compares the performance of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks with classical machine learning models (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree) on synthetic weather data, including global horizontal irradiance (GHI), temperature, humidity, and cloud cover. Feature ablation analysis reveals that adding more meteorological variables improves model performance, with BiLSTM achieving the highest accuracy (92.6%) and F1-score (0.91). BiLSTM’s ability to capture temporal dependencies allows it to effectively distinguish borderline weather states, such as partly cloudy versus sunny conditions. While classical models perform well, BiLSTM remains the superior choice for weather classification tasks. Future work will explore real-world datasets and advanced architectures like attention mechanisms to further improve performance."

A U-Net generator is applied in the architecture to draw details from the road and map, and a multi-scale PatchGAN discriminator reviews the results at several resolutions to enhance both the fineness and accuracy. Adversarial loss works on realism, L1 loss helps with pixel by pixel, and SSIM loss protects the structural elements. The model is designed using the Massachusetts Roads Dataset and it has attained 95% pixel accuracy, along with impressive accuracy and structure similarity. The proposed model provides road masks that are clearer and more reliable, regardless of environmental complexity or lighting conditions. Using this strategy, it is possible to skip manual mapping and support applications in urban planning, navigation, and responding to disasters. In the future, the optimal solution might involve trimming the model's size to make it work more quickly."

The machine can be modeled as two coupled three phase sets, each connected to an inverter, which is controlled to deliver the necessary power for the rotational speed required by the system. Thus, mathematical modeling is performed, allowing its representation through state-space. After modeling, controllers are designed in a cascade arrangement, consisting of two internal and parallel current loops and an external speed loop. Based on the developed model in this work, a decoupling action is proposed to mitigate the influences between coordinates. An advantage of the proposed decoupling action is no need to use derivative of state variables. To verify the effectiveness of the designed controllers with the decoupling action, digital simulations are conducted."

However, there is a lack of research investigating the effects of prolonged use of locomotion tunneling on cybersickness symptoms among novice users. To fill this gap, we used VRChat as our experimental platform. We recruited 24 novice VR users, defined as participants with no prior experience using immersive virtual environments. We collected five days of data within a one-week period. The results indicated that participants exhibited significant mitigation to cybersickness by Day 4. However, a change in the VR scene on Day 5 led to a notable increase in cybersickness symptoms. Qualitative feedback revealed participant-perceived causes of cybersickness and suggested that the effectiveness of locomotion tunneling was limited in some scenarios. Finally, we discussed the limitations of the study and proposed directions for future research."

In addition, a modified Wise IoU loss function was employed to improve bounding box regression by considering object shape and location more comprehensively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher mean Average Precision (mAP) and lower inference time compared to baseline methods, particularly under limited sample sizes.

To address the challenges of complex environmental interference such as uneven lighting, branch occlusion, and fruit overlap during the detection process, an MSR-DETR algorithm for cocoa disease and pest detection based on an improved RT-DETR model is proposed. First, the MSBlock is introduced to replace the standard convolutional blocks in the original backbone network. Through a cross-scale information interaction mechanism among different branches, the model can focus on the details and contours of targets, enabling the capture and fusion of multi-scale features, thereby improving the detection performance for multi-scale objects. Second, the Semantic and Detail Infusion (SDI) module is introduced to replace the simple concatenation operation in the traditional feature pyramid network, enhancing the detection capability for tiny diseases. Finally, a feature fusion module named REPBFAM is designed to improve feature fusion in the neck through multi-scale context extraction and bidirectional feature enhancement. Experimental results show that, compared to the original RT-DETR, the proposed algorithm achieves a 3.2% increase in mAP50, a 1.7% increase in mAP50:95, and a 2.4% increase in Recall."

    "abstract": "Face recognition has become one of the most widely adopted technologies, playing a crucial role in security, surveillance, authentication, and access control systems. Traditional approaches, often relying on handcrafted features and shallow classifiers, struggle to handle large-scale variations such as lighting, pose, partial occlusion, and facial expressions. With the rise of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable progress in extracting local spatial features, but they still face limitations in capturing longrange dependencies across the entire face structure. On the other hand, Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel in modeling global context and relationships, yet they require large amounts of data and lack strong inductive biases for local patterns. To overcome these challenges, this research proposes a hybrid CNN-ViT framework that integrates the local feature extraction power of CNN with the global attention mechanism of ViT. The model is trained and evaluated using benchmark datasets such as LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) and CelebA, which provide diverse samples with real-world variations. The hybrid framework first uses CNN layers to extract robust low-level facial features, which are then converted into tokens and processed by the transformer encoder for global representation learning. Experimental results show that the CNN-ViT hybrid significantly outperforms standalone CNN and ViT models in terms of accuracy of 98.31 %. This demonstrates the effectiveness of combining local and global feature learning, offering a more reliable and scalable solution for face recognition applications."

    "abstract": "As electronic and thermal management systems become more compact and power-dense, the need for efficient twophase cooling strategies, such as flow boiling in mini/microchannels, is increasing. Surface modification has been widely explored to enhance its heat transfer capabilities, with femtosecond laser surface processing (FLSP) emerging as a promising technique due to its durability, scalability, and ability to create hierarchical structures in a single step. This study presents the results of a single-channel flow boiling system using functionalized 304 stainless steel surfaces with deionized (DI) water as the working fluid. The surfaces were modified through FLSP, which generates self-organized micro- and nanoscale features, enhancing nucleation site density and increasing surface area for two-phase heat transfer. Three FLSP surfaces were fabricated by varying laser fluence at a fixed pulse count to investigate the influence of surface morphology on flow boiling performance. Each surface was tested up to critical heat flux (CHF) at a mass flux of $455 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{m}^{2} \\mathrm{~s}$, and the results were compared to a polished surface as a reference. Enhancement in the maximum heat transfer coefficient ranged from $70.1 \\%$ to $178.8 \\%$, and the highest fluence sample showed slight enhancements to CHF. Furthermore, the FLSP surfaces significantly reduced the magnitude of inlet pressure oscillations caused by flow instability. These enhancements are attributed primarily to the abundance of potential nucleation cavities that exist in a wide range of sizes. This study demonstrates the potential of FLSP-functionalized stainless steel surfaces as a promising technique for enhancing two-phase heat transfer performance."

    "abstract": "Virtual reality has emerged as a promising tool for managing stress and promoting emotional well-being. However, building adaptive virtual environments that respond to a user’s stress level in real time requires validated physiological measures that function reliably in immersive contexts. In this poster, we present the design of an upcoming within-subjects study aimed at evaluating the consistency of common stress-related physiological signals across traditional desktop and immersive virtual reality conditions. Participants will complete the Stroop Color-Word Task in both settings while wearing multiple biosensors that capture skin conductance, heart rate, brain activity, and body movement. Both physiological and self-reported measures will be analyzed to assess the robustness of these signals under different levels of immersion. Our goal is to determine whether stress detection techniques from screen-based research can be reliably extended to immersive virtual environments."

This paper focuses on the fabrication and characterization of silicon pin fin and liquid metal (PFLM) composites with target thermal resistance of $1 \\mathrm{~mm}^{2} \\mathrm{KW}^{-1}$. We micropatterned silicon pin fin wicks ($55 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ thickness, $41-96 \\%$ porosity, $1 \\times 1 \\mathrm{~cm}$ footprint) infiltrated with liquid metal (LM). We utilized high spatial resolution IR cross-sectional microscopy to map the temperature profile, achieving measurement sensitivity of less than $1 \\mathrm{~mm}^{2} \\mathrm{KW}^{-1}$. To quantify variability between TIMs due to assembly and coppergallium interfacial reactions, we stacked three PFLM composite samples for each measurement. We measured thermal resistances from $2.2 \\pm 0.8 \\mathrm{~mm}^{2} \\mathrm{KW}^{-1}(41 \\% \\mathrm{LM}-59 \\% \\mathrm{Si})$ to $5.2 \\pm 0.9 \\mathrm{~mm}^{2} \\mathrm{KW}^{-1} (96 \\% \\mathrm{LM}-4 \\% \\mathrm{Si})$. The results are in good agreement with a onedimensional (1D) conduction model and mark a reduction of up to a third from a $51 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ thick LM TIM without pin fins ($\\mathbf{3. 2 5} \\pm \\mathbf{1. 2 4} \\mathrm{mm}^{2} \\mathrm{KW}^{-1}$). We further show the pin fins precisely control the thickness of the LM. Future work should focus on optimizing the pin fin geometry and making the TIMs resistant to gallium corrosion."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a DC/DC converter with a wide output voltage range of 150-1000 V is proposed for electric vehicle (EV) charging, providing high efficiency across the entire range. The converter consists of two LLC resonant converters connected to a center-tapped DC bus, each linked to a three-winding transformer. On the secondary side, a modified rectifier bridge enables both LLCs to deliver power jointly to the load. This bridge uses a reduced number of diodes and only two additional relays for reconfiguration, fewer than many existing topologies, by leveraging a specific transformer connection. The output filter is a passive damped LCL filter that ensures low output current ripple. A theoretical model of the 4 kW-rated topology is developed and simulated for validation, with estimated efficiency exceeding 95% across the entire output range at rated power and reaching a maximum of 98.4%."

Key performance metrics such as outage probability, average channel capacity and average bit-error rate (BER) for binary modulation schemes have been analytically derived under diverse atmospheric scenarios. Intensity modulation with direct detection (IM/DD) is employed in the system for optical signal transmission. To provide a more practical approach, probability density function (PDF) and cummilative distribution function (CDF) expression are derived under turbulence and misalignment to verify the theoretical results.

Despite decades of progress in applied cryptography and an increasing adoption of HTTPS, a substantial amount of network traffic continues to lack proper transport-layer encryption, threatening the privacy of end users and the integrity of the networks they inhabit. Researchers and network operators examining the issue, however, face a dilemma – in order to understand and mitigate these risks, they often have to examine the very information they aim to protect, such as sensitive user data exposed in plaintext. This tension raises ethical concerns, impedes research efforts, and limits our understanding of the threats posed by unencrypted traffic."

    "abstract": "Millions of users leverage generative pretrained transformer (GPT)-based language models developed by leading model providers for a wide range of tasks. To support enhanced user interaction and customization, many platforms–such as OpenAI–now enable developers to create and publish tailored model instances, known as custom GPTs, via dedicated repositories or application stores. These custom GPTs empower users to browse and interact with specialized applications designed to meet specific needs. However, as custom GPTs see growing adoption, concerns regarding their security vulnerabilities have intensified. Existing research on these vulnerabilities remains largely theoretical, often lacking empirical, large-scale, and statistically rigorous assessments of associated risks. In this study, we analyze 14,904 custom GPTs to assess their susceptibility to seven exploitable threats, such as roleplay-based attacks, system prompt leakage, phishing content generation, and malicious code synthesis, across various categories and popularity tiers within the OpenAI marketplace. We introduce a multi-metric ranking system to examine the relationship between a custom GPT’s popularity and its associated security risks. Our findings reveal that over 95% of custom GPTs lack adequate security protections. The most prevalent vulnerabilities include roleplay-based vulnerabilities (96.51%), system prompt leakage (92.20%), and phishing (91.22%). Furthermore, we demonstrate that OpenAI’s foundational models exhibit inherent security weaknesses, which are often inherited or amplified in custom GPTs. These results highlight the urgent need for enhanced security measures and stricter content moderation to ensure the safe deployment of GPT-based applications."

This study analyzed rear-end conflicts on expressways and identified thresholds for various conflict indicators under both day and night conditions. Utilizing cost-effective 3D LiDAR technology, renowned for its robustness in low-light environments, this study elucidates the multifaceted influence of various factors on traffic safety dynamics across day and night conditions. Extreme value theory was applied to evaluate safety, incorporating factors like traffic environment and driver characteristics that are often overlooked in naturalistic studies. The analysis also included the effect of percentage oblique width on safety-critical events. Interestingly, drivers experienced about three times higher crash risks during the day compared to night, likely due to increased vigilance and caution at night. These findings offer valuable recommendations for setting headway requirements based on lighting conditions and can help improve advanced driver assistance systems to detect and respond more effectively to unsafe following distances."

    "abstract": "In the field of spacecraft pose estimation, complex illumination variations and limited computational resources pose critical challenges. Supervised learning methods achieve higher accuracy but require massive labeled data for training, which is extremely costly to acquire for space scenarios. Meanwhile, traditional non-learning methods, though label-free, suffer from significant performance degradation under complex illumination variations. This paper proposes an end-to-end unsupervised framework for bidirectional optimization of pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. First, an unsupervised multi-view stereo network is designed using a two-stage comparative learning strategy, which is capable of accurately reconstructing the target object from multi-view images to obtain depth information. Then, a feature fusion method based on the attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the depth information into the pose estimation network so as to enhance the robustness of pose estimation. In addition, spacecraft pose constraints are obtained from the pose estimation, which in turn constrain the 3D reconstruction. Finally, the probabilistic inference capability of the Bayesian network is utilized to adapt to different lighting environments. The proposed method eliminates the need for large labeled datasets, suits resource-limited spacecraft, and enables efficient pose estimation using lightweight monocular cameras. Experiments on SPEED, URSO, and a semi-physical platform show state-of-the-art accuracy (42.4% lower median rotation error than SOTA) and real-time capability (19ms/frame)."

    "abstract": "Gesture recognition, a crucial technology in human-computer interaction, finds applications across various domains, including smart homes, automotive driver assistance systems, and more. However, existing millimeter-wave radar-based gesture recognition algorithms often face challenges in achieving high accuracy and robustness in complex environments. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Space-Time Gesture Recognition algorithm (ST-Gesture) that leverages attention mechanisms. The approach first exploits the multi-dimensional information within mmWave radar data cubes. ST-Gesture processes the Range-Azimuth-Doppler (RAD) data to generate three types of spectrograms: Range-Azimuth Map (RAM), Azimuth-Doppler Map (ADM), and Range-Doppler Map (RDM). Spatial and temporal features are then extracted from these spectrograms using an enhanced model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs). A cross-attention mechanism is employed to fuse complementary information from the different spectrograms, thereby improving recognition accuracy. Experimental results, based on both a self-constructed dataset encompassing diverse environments and positions, as well as public dataset, demonstrate that ST-Gesture outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 99.2% accuracy. Additionally, the system's robustness to environmental and positional variations is thoroughly validated."

The system incorporates a multiple-frequency resonating compensation (MFRC), engineered to reduce the impedance of the imaginary part of the transmitter circuit when exposed to multi-frequency signals. A hybrid-frequency modulation algorithm is implemented by dynamically adjusting the frequency and duty cycle of pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals driving the dual arms of an H-bridge inverter, generating a synthesized current waveform with superimposed frequency components. Compensation capacitors are strategically integrated into the micro-coil array to enable frequency-selective addressing and assign distinct resonant frequencies to individual coils while minimizing inter-channel crosstalk. The WP-μMS prototype operates at 8 and 10 MHz, with experimental validation confirming its ability to achieve precise spatial targeting and independent power regulation. These advancements establish the WP-μMS as a critical tool for high-precision neuromodulation applications requiring localized and adjustable magnetic stimulation."

Through system simulation experiments on the Matla/Simulink platform, the trajectory tracking effect, state error convergence characteristics, control quantity variation patterns, and computational performance are comprehensively tested and analyzed, verifying the algorithm's related performance. Within each control cycle, this controller predicts the vehicle's future state and solves the optimal control problem within a finite time domain to generate an optimal control sequence, ensuring that the vehicle can precisely, smoothly, and safely track the given reference trajectory.

    "abstract": "A semiconductor packaging process is necessary to connect the semiconductor components to the applications that use them and the silicon chip. The chip is produced in various types of packages to meet the application requirements, and differences in the structure and materials of these packages can affect the thermal characteristics of the chip. The heat generated by the chip first dissipates through the package and then transfers system. To enhance the efficiency of the heat dissipation system, it is crucial to understand the thermal characteristics of the package, where the primary heat diffusion occurs. This paper analyzes and compares the thermal characteristics of different packages used in mobile Application Processor (AP), including stacked Package-On-Package (PoP), Flip-Chip Ball Grid Array (fcBGA), and fcBGA with a Heatslug (fcBGAH) used in automotive and datacenter applications. Typically, the thermal resistance value of a package is used as an indicator of its intrinsic thermal characteristics. However, the thermal resistance parameter varies not only based on the package structure but also depending on the external thermal environment of the system in which it is mounted, as well as the floorplan design of the heat source. Therefore, the thermal resistance value does not solely represent the package structure but serves as a comprehensive thermal characteristic indicator that includes specific environments and scenarios. This paper explores a method for defining the structural and material thermal characteristics of the package. It defines the inherent thermal characteristics of each package in terms of its vertical heat transfer rate and horizontal heat diffusion rate. Additionally, the paper also analyzes the sensitivity of the thermal characteristics of each package type to changes in the external heat dissipation environment."

    "abstract": "In the automated quenching process of scraper-type workpieces, the accuracy of initial pose detection directly determines the quality of subsequent operations. To address the issues of high equipment costs, complex calibration procedures, and maintenance difficulties in existing stereo vision positioning systems, this paper proposes a three-dimensional pose detection method that integrates monocular planar vision with laser displacement sensing. A heterogeneous sensor fusion framework is established by combining the two-dimensional contour features of the scraper, captured by a planar camera, with high-precision Z-axis displacement data acquired from a laser displacement sensor[1][3][7]. A geometric key-point matching algorithm is developed to extract the two-dimensional coordinates of critical edge points of the scraper, which are then combined with depth information to compute the three-dimensional pose parameters through spatial coordinate mapping. Experimental results show that within a detection area of 1500 mm × 1500 mm, the method achieves horizontal and vertical positioning errors of less than ± 2 mm, and angular deviations within ±3°[6][12][15], while reducing system cost by 80% compared with conventional stereo vision systems. Moreover, the proposed approach eliminates the need for complex vision modeling and sample training. This method provides a cost-effective and efficient solution for rapid positioning of large metal components in industrial settings."

    "abstract": "As the world seeks cleaner and smarter energy solutions, electric vehicles (EVs) are emerging as key players in reshaping energy systems. Bidirectional charging technologies enable EVs not only to recharge but also to return energy to the grid, enhancing flexibility and sustainability. However, frequent energy exchanges accelerate battery degradation, reducing lifetime and affecting economic feasibility. This review examines bidirectional charger topologies, battery aging mechanisms, and predictive models, highlighting both calendar and cycle aging. Reported studies indicate that lithium-ion batteries typically reach end-of-life (70-80% of initial capacity) after 1,000-3,000 cycles under V2G duty, with lifetime strongly dependent on depth of discharge, state of charge, temperature, and charge/discharge rate. High DoD (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$&gt;80 \\%$</tex>) and C-rates above 2 C can shorten lifetime by over 40 %, while optimized charging strategies may extend service life by up to 25 %. By consolidating quantitative data and modeling approaches, this work provides valuable guidance for researchers, manufacturers, and grid operators in designing resilient and economically viable EVbased energy infrastructures. Future work will focus on implementing battery systems with multiple chemistries, simulating their degradation under V2G duty using MATLAB/Simulink, and performing comparative analyses across technologies."

Conventional single-model approaches often lack the flexibility and generalization required for effective cross-domain classification. This study proposes BSL-LLMs (BERT-based Scheduling for Large Language Models in Scientific Literature), a dynamic multi-model scheduling framework for scientific literature classification. The method integrates a fine-tuned BERT model for coarse-grained label prediction with a dynamically updated expert selection strategy to route each query to the most suitable LLM from a pool of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 5}$</tex> pre-trained models. An adaptive probability matrix and entropy-based regularization are employed to balance specialization and exploration, while a confidence-weighted fusion mechanism combines outputs from BERT and the selected LLM to enhance decision reliability. Experiments on the CSL (Chinese Scientific Literature) dataset show that BSL-LLMs achieves an average classification accuracy of 76.8 %, outperforming individual LLMs and traditional deep learning baselines. The framework primarily relies on small-parameter models, reducing computational cost without compromising accuracy. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive scheduling strategy in improving both classification accuracy and generalization for scientific literature tasks. The framework shows potential for extension to other domain-specific applications, including question answering and summarization."

However, due to the differences of rapeseed varieties and environmental conditions in different plots, the growth process of rapeseed is often inconsistent, and the rapeseed in different plots is in different growth stages. In order to solve this problem, this study proposed a rape growth period recognition model GA-Segformer based on improved Segformer, which can efficiently and accurately identify the growth period of rape in each plot, thus improving the recognition efficiency of growth period. In the model design, GASegformer has been improved in many aspects: firstly, GGCA global grouping coordinate attention mechanism is introduced to enhance the model's attention to key features, thereby improving the detection accuracy and segmentation performance; Secondly, the improved ASPP multi-scale feature extraction module is added to obtain rich context information through hole convolution of different scales, which further improves the performance of the model. In addition, in terms of loss function, the advantages of CrossEntropyLoss and Focal Loss are combined to effectively optimize the training effect of the network. The comparative experimental results show that GA-SegFormer outperforms the traditional SegFormer model in mIoU and mDice, with an increase of 0.83 and 0.44, respectively. The experimental results show that the method can solve the recognition problem caused by the difference of rape growth period in different plots in the same plot, and can meet the application requirements of automatic recognition of rape growth period."

Both single-output and multi-output prediction strategies were investigated, with results showing that while multi-output modeling experienced slight performance degradation due to overlapping but distinct feature spaces, it offered a unified framework for predicting multiple outcomes simultaneously.

State-of-the-art methods such as empirical models and traditional machine learning techniques often fail to capture the complex interactions between material properties, loading conditions, and temperature variations, leading to less reliable predictions. This paper proposes a novel approach combining a Reflection Equivariant Quantum Neural Network (REQNN) with the Human Memory Optimization Algorithm (HMOA) to optimize the hyperparameters of the model. On integrating quantum machine learning (QML) techniques, the REQNN can account for symmetries and interactions in the data, enhancing its ability to predict rutting behavior more accurately. The HMOA optimizes the model's hyperparameters by balancing exploration and exploitation, inspired by human memory processes. This method aims to improve the prediction accuracy and reliability of PET-bituminous pavements under various loading and temperature conditions. The REQNN-HMOA method outperforms others with a rutting depth of 4.8 mm and 95% accuracy, showing superior predictive capabilities, lower errors, and enhanced material strength and stiffness under varying loading conditions."

While EMAs are favored over traditional actuators for their compact and lightweight design, their high power density results in significant heat generation during operation, posing a risk to reliability and performance. To mitigate this issue, a thermal management system (TMS) employing a dual passive cooling approach was investigated. The system integrates Phase Change Material (PCM) to absorb heat from the motor, along with heat pipes to transfer excess heat to a cooler external surface for dissipation. Using COMSOL Multiphysics’ heat transfer module, various designs were simulated with three distinct PCM thicknesses, both with and without heat pipes, under two different condenser cooling temperatures. The results highlight that an inverse Christmas tree fin design with 15 mm PCM layers on the inner and outer shells of an aluminum casing, combined with heat pipes on the outer shell, effectively maintains motor case temperatures below $\\sim 330 \\mathrm{~K}$ - well within safe operational limits. This configuration allows the PCM to remain in a solid-liquid mixture state for up to five operational cycles, each generating 340.8 W of heat, thereby significantly enhancing the EMA’s thermal performance and operational longevity."

However, for estimating the junction temperature of the IGBT, the results indicated that the tested module requires a new characterization due to its aging."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a portable, palmtop, battery-operable, dielectric blood coagulometry platform incorporating a single-chip, four-channel, microfluidic sensor. The system incorporates building blocks for generating the sensor excitation signal at 1 MHz, performing multichannel multiplexed impedance measurements, controlled heating of the sensor to a target temperature of 37 °C, and plotting the output data in real time on a 4.3-inch touchscreen display, all within a 17 cm × 9 cm × 5 cm 3D-printed enclosure and weighing ~470 g. The system dissipates ~2 W during active testing and is powered by either a 5-V USB-C input or a 6-Ah, 3.7-V lithium polymer (LiPo) battery, permitting continuous operation for up to 11 hours. When measuring fixed test impedances across all four channels, the system exhibits an excellent agreement with an Agilent 4294A impedance analyzer, with rms errors of ≤0.10% over a capacitance range of 47–330 pF and ≤0.37% over a conductance range of 2.13–10 mS. The system functionality is further evaluated in experiments involving healthy human whole blood samples that are in vitro-treated with heparin and tested in two uncoated and two tissue factor (TF)-coated microchannels of the sensor along with untreated samples. With heparin being an anticoagulant, the system expectedly shows a significant prolongation of coagulation time for heparinized blood samples compared to untreated ones with uncoated microchannels. However, with TF-coated microchannels, there is no significant difference in the coagulation time between untreated and heparinized blood samples due to a strong procoagulant effect of TF. This miniaturized, whole blood-based platform has significant potential for rapid assessment of hemostasis using microliter-range sample volumes at the point-of-need."

    "abstract": "Poetry classification has been studied in many languages, yet research on Myanmar poetry remains scarce due to limited resources and linguistic complexity. The diversity in syllable representations within the Myanmar script presents difficulties across multiple Natural Language Processing tasks due to inconsistent spellings of phonetically similar syllables. Traditional machine learning methods and transformer-based embedding, often fail to capture the unique rhythm, rhyme schemes, and structural depth of poetry, particularly in Languages with fewer digital resources. To address this challenge, this research proposes a deep learning-based system for the automatic classification of Myanmar poetry into five distinct genres. A Myanmar Syllable Normalization (MSN) algorithm is developed to preprocess and standardize poetic text, followed by feature transformation using hash code conversion and rhyme-based binarization. A Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model is then applied to capture sequential and stylistic patterns without extensive feature engineering. The proposed approach demonstrates promising results in recognizing rhythmic and structural nuances, contributing to computational analysis of Myanmar literature and cultural preservation."

A comprehensive grasp of mnemonic techniques enables the application of effective memory strategies and will enhance educational and professional outcomes. The Method of Loci is widely recognized as an effective scientific mnemonic technique, though it has certain limitations due to its high demand for spatial imagination. In this paper, we conducted an exploratory comparative study (N = 36) to investigate the relationship between three mnemonic methods (i.e., Loci Booklet, Personal Adapted Loci, LociVR) and memory performance and experience. We recorded subjective ratings of user experience, measured times, test scores, and memory retention in this study. The quantitative and qualitative analyzes provide design directions for memory training based on mnemonic methods. We further identified the design goals from the preliminary investigation, and proposed key design features, as well as interactive mechanisms, through a participatory workshop (N = 28). Based on these findings, we derived a set of design implications. In future, the design of LociVR would be optimized and contribute to a more personalized and interactive experience for memory training."

    "abstract": "This study presents an innovative approach to improving the thermal performance of solid-solid phase change material (SSPCM)-based honeycomb heat storage systems through the development of cascaded latent heat thermal energy storage (CLHTES) units. By strategically layering different SSPCMs within the honeycomb structure, the design optimizes heat transfer, reduces melting time, and enhances overall thermal efficiency. The enthalpy-porosity method is used for numerical analysis, focusing on the phase transition behavior within an insulated cavity containing two commercial organic SSPCMs, X30 and X40. These materials have phase transition temperatures of $28.65^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to $40.85^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and $39.00^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to $51.91^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, respectively, making them ideal for thermal management in high-performance computing (HPC) systems. The cascaded configuration demonstrates a significant $\\mathbf{3 1. 5 \\%}$ increase in safe operational time over single SSPCM designs, along with an average enhancement ratio of 4.83. A parametric analysis identifies an optimal $3: 1$ ratio of X40 to X30 for maximizing operational time and phase transition uniformity. This cascaded SSPCM honeycomb design effectively balances heat transfer rates, offering enhanced thermal management solutions for high-density electronics, particularly in HPC applications. The findings underscore the potential of SSPCM-based systems to address critical thermal challenges in modern electronics."

    "abstract": "The practice of cultivating the soil, growing crops and keeping livestock is referred to as farming. An essential component of a nation's economic growth is agriculture. Farming accounts for around 58 % of a nation's main source of income. Up until now, farmers have used traditional farming methods. These methods took a lot of time and were less productive since they were imprecise. By accurately identifying actions that taken at appropriate time, precise farming contributes to increased output. Precision farming includes forecasting the weather, evaluating the soil, suggesting crops to be grown, and figuring out how much fertilizer and pesticides are necessary. In this manuscript, Smart Farming System for Plant Disease Detection using Optimized Spectral Domain Reconstruction Graph Neural Network (SFS-PDD-SDRGNN) is proposed. Initially real time input data is gathered from IoT sensors. Then, input data is fed into preprocessing stage. In preprocessing, Regularized Bias aware Ensemble Kalman Filtering (RBAEKF) is utilized to remove noise and normalize data. After preprocessing, preprocessed data is fed to Spectral Domain Reconstruction Graph Neural Network (SDRGNN) for plant disease detection as fungal infection and nutrient deficiency. To enhance accuracy, the Arctic Tern Optimization Algorithm (ATOA) is utilized to optimize SDRGNN weight parameters and ensuring precise plant disease detection. The proposed SFS-PDD-SDRGNN method is executed in Python and evaluated utilizing performance metrics like accuracy, detection rate, recall, precision, computation time.

The existing electronic packaging fails to meet the high-temperature requirements of modern automotive applications, which operate above $150^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. This extreme operating temperature degrades the performance of electronic circuits. It causes reliability issues over time which creates a need for circuit designs using new manufacturing techniques that can maintain its performance at even extreme temperatures condition. The major focus of this research is to develop and test high-performance logic gate circuits on copper-clad ceramic substrates using laser pattern manufacturing techniques. These circuits can withstand high-temperature conditions relevant to current automotive applications. This work will validate the reliability and operability of these circuits at high temperatures and focus on their integration with SiC devices in thermally enhanced additive packaging. The traditional methods do not fully utilize the advanced manufacturing techniques for electronic packaging. This work avoids these limitations by using copper-clad ceramic substrates that improve thermal conductivity and integration for high-temperature applications. Utilizing copper-clad ceramic substrates, three types of logic gates-NAND, NOR, and NOT-were fabricated, with three samples of each tested at room temperature $\\left(23^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\right), 125^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, and $\\mathbf{1 7 5}^{\\boldsymbol{\\circ}} \\mathbf{C}$.

The circuits were designed and optimized using LTSpice simulations, fabricated through laser patterning techniques, and assessed for signal integrity and performance reliability. Results indicate that the circuits maintain operational stability across the temperature range, demonstrating the potential of copper-clad ceramic substrates and advanced manufacturing methods to meet the thermal and reliability demands of automotive applications."

This technique aims to reduce the loop inductance and volume of power electronic systems but increases heat extraction challenges. Such die stacking technique introduces heat loading from one die to another and additional layers in between the devices increases effective thermal resistance. With highly resistive path between junction to case the traditional cooling systems will not be adequate to keep the device temperature within manufacturers recommended limits unless the device rating is significantly reduced. To overcome the thermal challenges, a novel stack design has been proposed along with cooling system that can match the thermal performance of the traditional packaging techniques with added benefit of low power loop inductance and high density. The proposed module performance is validated with a detailed finite element simulation platform."

    "abstract": "In recent years, systems of intelligent transportation have increasingly relied on advanced machine learning and deep learning models for accurate traffic forecasting, which is critical for urban mobility, and smart city development. Traditional work on Spatio-Temporal Gated Graph Attention Networks (STGGAN) has shown promising results. However, model faces challenges due to its dependence on a static graph structure, which cannot adapt to dynamic traffic variations, and its single-task focus on speed prediction. Therefore, a Dynamic Multi-Task Spatio-Temporal Gated Graph Attention Network (DM-STGGAN) is proposed. Initially, traffic datasets like California Performance Measurement System District 4 (PeMSD4) and PeMSD8 are preprocessed by cleaning missing values and deriving indicators of key traffic including flow, density, and average speed. Further, a Dynamic Graph Learner adaptively updates adjacency matrices using both road topology and real-time traffic correlations followed by node and edge feature representation. Then, temporal dependencies are captured using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), while edge-aware multihead attention with a gated mechanism models complex spatial dependencies. Furthermore, a multi-task output layer jointly predicts speed, flow, and density for comprehensive forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed DM-STGGAN achieves lower root mean square error (2.7 speed), mean absolute error (1.6 speed) and higher accuracy (98.4 %) respectively."

FlexPCR leverages oligo extensions to generate distinct fluorescence-coded PCR template for multiple RNA targets, enabling multiplexed amplification detection using universal primers and probes with a limited number of fluorescence colors. Subsequent digital detection allows accurate decoding and quantification of individual targets, eliminating the issue of mixed signals common in bulk assays. We demonstrate FlexPCR by developing a two-color-based assay for quantification of seven host-response mRNA biomarkers in various human total RNA samples. The assay accuracy is confirmed through comparison with the gold-standard single-plex RT-qPCR method.

Despite extensive research over the years, a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon remains elusive, limiting its industrial application. In this study, we experimentally investigate analytical predictions suggesting the existence of an optimal contact angle and challenge the common assumption that increasing hydrophobicity will invariably enhance heat transfer performance. By creating self-assembled monolayers of thiols on gold-coated surfaces, we systematically examined contact angles ranging from 84° to 115°. Experiments conducted in a temperature and pressure controlled climatic chamber provided strong evidence for an optimal contact angle between 96° and 105°. These findings not only support analytical models but also represent a paradigm shift in the design and optimization of condenser surface coatings. The insights gained from this research hold significant implications for industries such as power generation, chemical processing, liquid separation, desalination, and thermal management, while also expanding our understanding of this intriguing process."

    "abstract": "Visual distortions significantly impact user experience in virtual reality (VR). Understanding these effects is essential for delivering a higher-quality VR experience. However, existing studies focus on distortions from image capturing, processing, or display, relying largely on self-reported scores. The impact of visual distortions on viewport caused by simulated visual impairments in VR remains underexplored, despite its importance in creating realistic VR experiences, raising public awareness, and studying the effects of visual impairment. This study proposes a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based behavior entropy metric to measure the effects of visual distortions on a user's viewport in a 6-Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) VR navigation experience. An Orientation and Mobility (O&M) VR scenario designed to assess the navigation performance of visually impaired individuals was used for the experiment. Results reveal a relationship between behavior entropy and distortion severity: slight to moderate distortions reduce entropy, while severe distortions cause a significant decline. Additionally, behavior entropy correlates with O&M test performance metrics, indicating its potential as an objective behavioral measure of VR navigation performance. These findings highlight the value of behavior analysis in evaluating VR user experience, offering a new analytical perspective on visual distortion effects and expanding applications of behavior analysis in multidisciplinary research."

    "abstract": "The performance of power semiconductor devices at cryogenic temperatures has gained increasing attention due to potential benefits in efficiency, thermal control, and power density. This paper investigates the static and dynamic behavior of a commercial 2-pack IGBT module (X2G300SD12P3-1200 V <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$/ 300$</tex> A) at room temperature and at <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$-196{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$</tex> (liquid nitrogen). Three configurations were analyzed: the standard encapsulated module at room temperature, the open chip without gel at room temperature, and the open chip without gel at cryogenic temperature. Experimental results reveal that at cryogenic temperature the initial voltage drop increases from 0.6 V to 1.1 V, and the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$I_{C}-V_{C E}$</tex> curve no longer reaches a linear region, exhibiting a variable on-resistance. In terms of switching behavior, the turnon transient is strongly affected, with higher <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$d v / d t$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$d i / d t$</tex>, an increased <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$V_{C E}$</tex> overvoltage (813 V compared to 633 V at room temperature), and a collector current tail nearly twice as large. These findings highlight the significant impact of extreme temperature reduction on IGBT operation and provide valuable insight for benchmarking against other devices for cryogenic power electronic systems."

    "abstract": "The development of cross-border tourism cooperation zones, particularly in Mengla County-a key node under China's “Belt and Road” initiative-requires accurate tourism economy forecasting to support regional planning and policy-making. This study employs the XGBoost algorithm to construct a predictive model integrating multi-dimensional data, including tourist flow, consumption levels, and infrastructure. Feature engineering and time-series sliding windows are applied to enhance model performance. The XGBoost model achieved an MSE of 15.23, RMSE of 3.91, and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}$</tex> of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{0. 8 9}$</tex>, outperforming linear and decision tree regression models. It effectively captured seasonal variations and nonlinear relationships, demonstrating high predictive accuracy and robustness. The XGBoost-based model offers a scientifically-grounded tool for forecasting tourism economic trends in cross-border regions. Future work should incorporate broader data sources and improve adaptability to dynamic policy and environmental changes."

    "abstract": "This study explores how tracking loss, an issue frequently encountered in Extended Reality (XR), can be reframed as a form of interactional uncertainty that mirrors real world experiences with animals, thereby enhancing user experiences with embodied virtual pets (EVPs). A user study (N = 17) was conducted, documenting participants’ free form interactions with an EVP system and analyzing both quantitative questionnaire data and qualitative interview responses. Results indicate that participants primarily detected tracking errors through unexpected anomalies in the EVP’s behavior; however, the number of instances they reported was significantly lower than those recorded by observers and the system. Users’ reactions to tracking loss whether through active attempts to reengage or passive waiting together with their feedback on the overall interaction process, revealed a consistent expectation that EVPs should demonstrate more autonomous and life-like behaviors. These findings offer valuable insights and design implications for transforming system errors into expressions of lifelikeness in the development of EVP interactions within XR environments."
