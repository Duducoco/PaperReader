    "abstract": "Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) quantifies tissue magnetic susceptibility from magnetic-resonance phase data and plays a crucial role in brain microstructure imaging, iron-deposition assessment, and neurological-disease research. However, single-orientation QSM inversion remains highly ill-posed because the dipole kernel exhibits a cone-null region in the Fourier domain, leading to streaking artifacts and structural loss. To overcome this limitation, we propose QSMnet-INR, a deep, physics-informed framework that integrates an Implicit Neural Representation (INR) into the k-space domain. The INR module continuously models multi-directional dipole responses and explicitly completes the cone-null region, while a frequency-domain residual-weighted Dipole Loss enforces physical consistency. The overall network combines a 3D U-Net-based QSMnet backbone with the INR module through alternating optimization for end-to-end joint training. Experiments on the 2016 QSM Reconstruction Challenge, a multi-orientation GRE dataset, and both in-house and public single-orientation clinical data demonstrate that QSMnet-INR consistently outperforms conventional and recent deep-learning approaches across multiple quantitative metrics. The proposed framework shows notable advantages in structural recovery within cone-null regions and in artifact suppression. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary contributions of the INR module and Dipole Loss to detail preservation and physical stability. Overall, QSMnet-INR effectively alleviates the ill-posedness of single-orientation QSM without requiring multi-orientation acquisition, achieving high accuracy, robustness, and strong cross-scenario generalization-highlighting its potential for clinical translation."

    "abstract": "Robots that learn manipulation skills from everyday human videos could acquire broad capabilities without tedious robot data collection. We propose a video-to-video translation framework that converts ordinary human-object interaction videos into motion-consistent robot manipulation videos with realistic, physically grounded interactions. Our approach does not require any paired human-robot videos for training only a set of unpaired robot videos, making the system easy to scale. We introduce a transferable representation that bridges the embodiment gap: by inpainting the robot arm in training videos to obtain a clean background and overlaying a simple visual cue (a marker and arrow indicating the gripper's position and orientation), we can condition a generative model to insert the robot arm back into the scene. At test time, we apply the same process to human videos (inpainting the person and overlaying human pose cues) and generate high-quality robot videos that mimic the human's actions. We fine-tune a SOTA video diffusion model (Wan 2.2) in an in-context learning manner to ensure temporal coherence and leveraging of its rich prior knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly more realistic and grounded robot motions compared to baselines, pointing to a promising direction for scaling up robot learning from unlabeled human videos.

    "abstract": "As medical large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical workflows, concerns around alignment robustness, and safety are escalating. Prior work on model extraction has focused on classification models or memorization leakage, leaving the vulnerability of safety-aligned generative medical LLMs underexplored. We present a black-box distillation attack that replicates the domain-specific reasoning of safety-aligned medical LLMs using only output-level access. By issuing 48,000 instruction queries to Meditron-7B and collecting 25,000 benign instruction response pairs, we fine-tune a LLaMA3 8B surrogate via parameter efficient LoRA under a zero-alignment supervision setting, requiring no access to model weights, safety filters, or training data. With a cost of $12, the surrogate achieves strong fidelity on benign inputs while producing unsafe completions for 86% of adversarial prompts, far exceeding both Meditron-7B (66%) and the untuned base model (46%). This reveals a pronounced functional-ethical gap, task utility transfers, while alignment collapses. To analyze this collapse, we develop a dynamic adversarial evaluation framework combining Generative Query (GQ)-based harmful prompt generation, verifier filtering, category-wise failure analysis, and adaptive Random Search (RS) jailbreak attacks. We also propose a layered defense system, as a prototype detector for real-time alignment drift in black-box deployments. Our findings show that benign-only black-box distillation exposes a practical and under-recognized threat: adversaries can cheaply replicate medical LLM capabilities while stripping safety mechanisms, underscoring the need for extraction-aware safety monitoring."

    "abstract": "Rotating black holes when attached to a cosmic string have their rotational energy extracted leading to a change in its spin and mass. The spin of a black hole can be measured using various methods for an accreting black hole in an X-ray binary system. Accretion disks around black holes have an innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) whose location is directly dependent on spin and mass of the black hole. The orbit's location changes as the black hole's spin changes and hence can be a method to detect the presence of cosmic strings. This study investigates this change and suggests the ejection of accretion material as black hole spin approaches maximum for prograde motion and material falling into the black hole for retrograde motion, regardless of the presence of cosmic string. However, in the presence of cosmic string, the spin-up process due to accretion is found out to be slower, even with high accretion rates and is detectable. There is a transition phase that occurs as the black hole approaches maximum spin, where even small changes in spin result in significant changes in the ISCO's position. Accreting black holes attached to a large string never reach this transition phase and this absence serves as potential evidence for the existence of a cosmic string."

    "abstract": "Traffic accidents result in millions of injuries and fatalities globally, with a significant number occurring at intersections each year. Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is an effective strategy for enhancing safety at these urban junctures. Despite the growing popularity of Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods in optimizing TSC, these methods often prioritize driving efficiency over safety, thus failing to address the critical balance between these two aspects. Additionally, these methods usually need more interpretability. CounterFactual (CF) learning is a promising approach for various causal analysis fields. In this study, we introduce a novel framework to improve RL for safety aspects in TSC. This framework introduces a novel method based on CF learning to address the question: ``What if, when an unsafe event occurs, we backtrack to perform alternative actions, and will this unsafe event still occur in the subsequent period?'' To answer this question, we propose a new structure causal model to predict the result after executing different actions, and we propose a new CF module that integrates with additional ``X'' modules to promote safe RL practices. Our new algorithm, CFLight, which is derived from this framework, effectively tackles challenging safety events and significantly improves safety at intersections through a near-zero collision control strategy. Through extensive numerical experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that CFLight reduces collisions and improves overall traffic performance compared to conventional RL methods and the recent safe RL model. Moreover, our method represents a generalized and safe framework for RL methods, opening possibilities for applications in other domains. The data and code are available in the github https://github.com/MJLee00/CFLight-Enhancing-Safety-with-Traffic-Signal-Control-through-Counterfactual-Learning."

This study develops a forecasting framework that leverages the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) MasterFormat as the target data structure, enabling predictions at the six-digit section level and supporting detailed cost projections across a wide spectrum of building materials. To enhance predictive accuracy, the framework integrates explanatory variables such as raw material prices, commodity indexes, and macroeconomic indicators. Four time-series models, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), and Chronos-Bolt, were evaluated under both baseline configurations (using CSI data only) and extended versions with explanatory variables. Results demonstrate that incorporating explanatory variables significantly improves predictive performance across all models. Among the tested approaches, the LSTM model consistently achieved the highest accuracy, with RMSE values as low as 1.390 and MAPE values of 0.957, representing improvements of up to 59\\% over the traditional statistical time-series model, ARIMA. Validation across multiple CSI divisions confirmed the framework's scalability, while Division 06 (Wood, Plastics, and Composites) is presented in detail as a demonstration case. This research offers a robust methodology that enables owners and contractors to improve budgeting practices and achieve more reliable cost estimation at the Definitive level."

    "abstract": "With the rise of mega-satellite constellations, the integration of hierarchical non-terrestrial and terrestrial networks has become a cornerstone of 6G coverage enhancements. In these hierarchical satellite networks, controllers manage satellite switches within their assigned domains. However, the high mobility of LEO satellites and field-of-view (FOV) constraints pose fundamental challenges to efficient domain partitioning. Centralized control approaches face scalability bottlenecks, while distributed architectures with onboard controllers often disregard FOV limitations, leading to excessive signaling overhead. LEO satellites outside a controller's FOV require an average of five additional hops, resulting in a 10.6-fold increase in response time. To address these challenges, we propose Eunomia, a three-step domain-partitioning framework that leverages movement-aware FOV segmentation within a hybrid control plane combining ground stations and MEO satellites. Eunomia reduces control plane latency by constraining domains to FOV-aware regions and ensures single-hop signaling. It further balances traffic load through spectral clustering on a Control Overhead Relationship Graph and optimizes controller assignment via the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm. We implement Eunomia on the Plotinus emulation platform with realistic constellation parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that Eunomia reduces request loss by up to 58.3%, control overhead by up to 50.3\\%, and algorithm execution time by 77.7% significantly outperforming current state-of-the-art solutions."

    "abstract": "Analytical studies of light bending in a dispersive medium near compact objects, e.g., black holes or neutron stars, are most challenged by a suitable definition of the medium. The most realistic model would be a hot magnetized plasma. In such a medium, however, an analytical description of light rays is very difficult. Therefore, usually an isotropic dispersive medium is assumed in analytical calculations. While it is possible to formulate equations for a general refractive index, which some studies do, most attention in the literature is given to the particular case of a cold, non-magnetized electron-ion plasma. Whereas this model covers many astrophysically relevant situations, there are indications that in some cases the plasma temperature is so high that the approximation of a cold plasma is no longer valid. For this reason, we consider in this paper a warm, non-magnetized electron-ion plasma, where the temperature is not set equal to zero but assumed to be small enough, such that relevant equations can be linearized with respect to it. After discussing the general equations for light rays in such a medium on a general-relativistic spacetime, we specify to the axially symmetric and stationary case which includes the spherically symmetric and static case. In particular, we calculate the influence of a warm plasma on the bending angle. In the spherically symmetric and static case, we also calculate the shadow in a warm plasma. We illustrate the general results with a static (respectively corotating) and an infalling warm plasma on Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes."

This paper examines image labeling performance across human participants and deep neural networks, focusing on low-resolution, perceptually degraded stimuli. Drawing from computational cognitive science, cognitive architectures, and connectionist-symbolic hybrid models, we contrast human strategies such as analogical reasoning, shape-based recognition, and confidence modulation with AI's feature-based processing. Grounded in Marr's tri-level hypothesis, Simon's bounded rationality, and Thagard's frameworks of representation and emotion, we analyze participant responses in relation to Grad-CAM visualizations of model attention. Human behavior is further interpreted through cognitive principles modeled in ACT-R and Soar, revealing layered and heuristic decision strategies under uncertainty. Our findings highlight key parallels and divergences between biological and artificial systems in representation, inference, and confidence calibration. The analysis motivates future neuro-symbolic architectures that unify structured symbolic reasoning with connectionist representations. Such architectures, informed by principles of embodiment, explainability, and cognitive alignment, offer a path toward AI systems that are not only performant but also interpretable and cognitively grounded."

The ingradients of the method include the approximation space recently proposed, a discontinuous Galerkin scheme extensively used, and a linear system solver with a natural preconditioner. Comparing to traditional discontinuous Galerkin methods, we refer to the new method as being more efficient in the following sense. The numerical performance of the new method shows that: 1) much less error can be reached using the same degrees of freedom; 2) the sparse matrix therein has much fewer nonzero entries so that both the storage space and the solution time cost for the iterative solver are reduced; 3) the preconditioner is proved to be optimal with respect to the mesh size in the absorbing case. Such advantage becomes more pronounced as the approximation order increases."

Here, we demonstrate precise control of ferromagnetism in a SrRuO$_3$ ultrathin film, where a high density of states (DOS), arising from low-dimensional quantum states, places the system at the crossover between a non-magnetic and bulk ferromagnetic state. Using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SRPES/ARPES), transport measurements, and theoretical calculations, we systematically tune the Fermi level via electron doping across the high-DOS point. We directly visualize the spin-split band structure and reveal its influence on both magnetic and transport properties. Our findings provide compelling evidence that magnetism can be engineered through DOS control at a phase crossover, establishing a pathway for the rational design of tunable quantum materials."

    "abstract": "High-Throughput Satellites (HTS) use beam hopping to handle non-uniform and time-varying ground traffic demand. A significant technical challenge in beam hopping is the computation of effective illumination patterns. Traditional algorithms, like the genetic algorithm, require over 300 seconds to compute a single illumination pattern for just 37 cells, whereas modern HTS typically covers over 300 cells, rendering current methods impractical for real-world applications. Advanced approaches, such as multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, face convergence issues when the number of cells exceeds 40. In this paper, we introduce Tyche, a hybrid computation framework designed to address this challenge. Tyche incorporates a Monte Carlo Tree Search Beam Hopping (MCTS-BH) algorithm for computing illumination patterns and employs sliding window and pruning techniques to significantly reduce computation time. Specifically, MCTS-BH can compute one illumination pattern for 37 cells in just 12 seconds. To ensure real-time computation, we use a Greedy Beam Hopping (G-BH) algorithm, which provides a provisional solution while MCTS-BH completes its computation in the background. Our evaluation results show that MCTS-BH can increase throughput by up to 98.76%, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing solutions."

This work presents a lightweight convolutional neural network that performs real-time tune extraction from Schottky spectra with sub-millisecond inference latency and calibrated uncertainty estimates. The model uses attention-based pooling for reliable peak localization and a dual-branch architecture that jointly predicts the tune and its associated uncertainty. Trained with a Laplace negative log-likelihood loss, it produces uncertainty estimates whose magnitude tracks the instantaneous prediction error, which enables uncertainty-aware Kalman filtering for temporal smoothing. Experiments on a large synthetic dataset spanning SNR levels from 0 to $-20$\\,dB demonstrate substantial performance gains over traditional peak-detection baselines, while the Kalman filter further suppresses transient outliers in time-series operation. Preliminary validation on operational beam data confirms stable tune tracking without retraining. With only about $2.0\\times 10^{4}$ trainable parameters and real-time inference on commodity GPU hardware, the proposed diagnostic offers a practical solution for rapid and accurate betatron tune monitoring in compact medical synchrotrons and similar accelerators."

    "abstract": "This letter reports on the design and demonstration of high-performance Beta-Ga2O3 FinFETs utilizing MOCVD-grown Si delta-doped channels to achieve enhanced carrier transport and electrostatic control. A record high sheet charge density of 3.3x10^13 cm^-2 was modulated using 100 nm fin channels, delivering a peak drain current of 410 mA/mm and a peak transconductance of 60 mS/mm. The FinFET architecture enables strong gate modulation, achieving a high Ion/Ioff ratio between 10^8 and 10^9. A low contact resistance of 0.42 ohm.mm was achieved to the Si delta-doped channel using MOCVD contact regrowth. Small-signal RF characterization revealed a current-gain cutoff frequency (fT) of 3.8 GHz and a maximum oscillation frequency (fMAX) of 2.1 GHz for a 0.8-micrometer gate length. These results demonstrate the efficacy of combining precision delta-doping with a 3D FinFET geometry for high-frequency Beta-Ga2O3 electronics, establishing a platform for future RF and high-power applications"

    "abstract": "Expert Parallelism (EP) permits Mixture of Experts (MoE) models to scale beyond a single GPU. To address load imbalance across GPUs in EP, existing approaches aim to balance the number of tokens each GPU processes. Surprisingly, we find that this objective degrades performance rather than improving it when processing is memory-bound - a common occurrence in MoE serving, especially in the decode phase. Our analysis reveals that balancing the number of tokens processed per GPU increases the number of activated experts, exacerbating memory pressure in the memory-bound regime. We propose Minimum Expert Token ROuting, a novel token-routing algorithm for high-performance expert-parallel MoE serving in the memory-bound regime that balances the number of activated experts per GPU rather than token counts. METRO achieves near-optimal routing quality with minimal computational overhead by jointly optimizing algorithmic efficiency and leveraging the GPU's parallel processing power. To guarantee routing quality, METRO also employs a novel allGather scheme to gather global top-k knowledge, which has minimal overhead compared to conventional allToAll. Our evaluation of METRO against EPLB on both real systems (vLLM over 8 A100 GPUs) and a proprietary simulator (8-16 B200 GPUs) shows that METRO reduces decode latency by 11 - 22%, and total token throughput by 3 - 21% for Qwen3 and DeepSeek-V3 serving, where prefill and decode phases are co-deployed. In addition, by trading latency headroom for throughput, METRO improves decode throughput by up to 4.11x over EPLB at a fixed decode SLO."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses a long-standing open problem in the analysis of linear mixed models with crossed random effects under unbalanced designs: how to find an analytic expression for the inverse of $\\mathbf{V}$, the covariance matrix of the observed response. The inverse matrix $\\mathbf{V}^{-1}$ is required for likelihood-based estimation and inference. However, for unbalanced crossed designs, $\\mathbf{V}$ is dense and the lack of a closed-form representation for $\\mathbf{V}^{-1}$, until now, has made using likelihood-based methods computationally challenging and difficult to analyse mathematically. We use the Khatri--Rao product to represent $\\mathbf{V}$ and then to construct a modified covariance matrix whose inverse admits an exact spectral decomposition. Building on this construction, we obtain an elegant and simple approximation to $\\mathbf{V}^{-1}$ for asymptotic unbalanced designs. For non-asymptotic settings, we derive an accurate and interpretable approximation under mildly unbalanced data and establish an exact inverse representation as a low-rank correction to this approximation, applicable to arbitrary degrees of unbalance. Simulation studies demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and computational tractability of the proposed framework."

    "abstract": "The increasing popularity of long Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has created an urgent need for automatic and interpretable models that can evaluate the image-text alignment in long prompt scenarios. However, the existing T2I alignment benchmarks predominantly focus on short prompt scenarios and only provide MOS or Likert scale annotations. This inherent limitation hinders the development of long T2I evaluators, particularly in terms of the interpretability of alignment. In this study, we contribute LongT2IBench, which comprises 14K long text-image pairs accompanied by graph-structured human annotations. Given the detail-intensive nature of long prompts, we first design a Generate-Refine-Qualify annotation protocol to convert them into textual graph structures that encompass entities, attributes, and relations. Through this transformation, fine-grained alignment annotations are achieved based on these granular elements. Finally, the graph-structed annotations are converted into alignment scores and interpretations to facilitate the design of T2I evaluation models. Based on LongT2IBench, we further propose LongT2IExpert, a LongT2I evaluator that enables multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to provide both quantitative scores and structured interpretations through an instruction-tuning process with Hierarchical Alignment Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LongT2IExpert in alignment evaluation and interpretation.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have extended the high-speed rendering capability of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) into the temporal domain, enabling real-time rendering of dynamic scenes. However, one of the major remaining challenges lies in modeling long-range motion-contained dynamic videos, where a naive extension of existing methods leads to severe memory explosion, temporal flickering, and failure to handle appearing or disappearing occlusions over time. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 4DGS framework characterized by an Anchor Relay-based Bidirectional Blending (ARBB) mechanism, named MoRel, which enables temporally consistent and memory-efficient modeling of long-range dynamic scenes. Our method progressively constructs locally canonical anchor spaces at key-frame time index and models inter-frame deformations at the anchor level, enhancing temporal coherence. By learning bidirectional deformations between KfA and adaptively blending them through learnable opacity control, our approach mitigates temporal discontinuities and flickering artifacts. We further introduce a Feature-variance-guided Hierarchical Densification (FHD) scheme that effectively densifies KfA's while keeping rendering quality, based on an assigned level of feature-variance. To effectively evaluate our model's capability to handle real-world long-range 4D motion, we newly compose long-range 4D motion-contained dataset, called SelfCap$_{\\text{LR}}$. It has larger average dynamic motion magnitude, captured at spatially wider spaces, compared to previous dynamic video datasets. Overall, our MoRel achieves temporally coherent and flicker-free long-range 4D reconstruction while maintaining bounded memory usage, demonstrating both scalability and efficiency in dynamic Gaussian-based representations."

Weighted DRE is the most promising among existing methods, exhibiting doubly strong robustness from an asymptotic perspective. This study demonstrates that Weighted DRE achieves sparse consistency even under heavy contamination within a non-asymptotic framework. This method addresses two significant challenges in density ratio estimation and robust estimation. For density ratio estimation, we provide the non-asymptotic properties of estimating unbounded density ratios under the assumption that the weighted density ratio function is bounded. For robust estimation, we introduce a non-asymptotic framework for doubly strong robustness under heavy contamination, assuming that at least one of the following conditions holds: (i) contamination ratios are small, and (ii) outliers have small weighted values. This work provides the first non-asymptotic analysis of strong robustness under heavy contamination."

Operating at ultra-low temperature, density fluctuations of the dipolar BEC emulate a vacuum field with Lorentz-violating dispersion, while the two impurities function as Unruh-DeWitt detectors for the BEC quasiparticles. We study the harvesting of entanglement from the quantum vacuum of this analogue Lorentz-violating quantum field by spatially separated Unruh-DeWitt detectors. Our analysis reveals key parameter dependencies that optimize the harvesting of entanglement. In particular, unlike the Lorentz-invariant case, smoother detector switchings does not enhance the entanglement harvesting efficiency from the Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum. Moreover, the strength of the Lorentz-invariant violation can shift the optimal energy structure of the detectors for harvesting entanglement from the Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum-a clear deviation from the Lorentz-invariant scenario. As a fundamental quantum mechanical setup, our quantum fluid platform provides an experimentally realizable testbed for examining the entanglement harvesting protocol from an effective Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum using a pair of impurity probers, which may also has potential implications for exploring the Lorentz-invariant violation in quantum field theory."

We introduce a novel debiasing approach that corrects the bias for the entire Bayesian posterior distribution. We establish a new Bernstein-von Mises theorem that guarantees the frequentist validity of the debiased posterior. We demonstrate the practical performance of our proposal through Monte Carlo simulations and two empirical applications in economics."

Yet this trend carries significant risks if their strategic behavior is not well understood. In this work, we revisit the NegotiationArena framework and run controlled simulation experiments on a diverse set of frontier LLMs across three multi turn bargaining games: Buyer Seller, Multi turn Ultimatum, and Resource Exchange. We ask whether improved general reasoning capabilities lead to rational, unbiased, and convergent negotiation strategies. Our results challenge this assumption. We find that models diverge into distinct, model specific strategic equilibria rather than converging to a unified optimal behavior. Moreover, strong numerical and semantic anchoring effects persist: initial offers are highly predictive of final agreements, and models consistently generate biased proposals by collapsing diverse internal valuations into rigid, generic price points. More concerningly, we observe dominance patterns in which some models systematically achieve higher payoffs than their counterparts. These findings underscore an urgent need to develop mechanisms to mitigate these issues before deploying such systems in real-world scenarios."

The automation reduces the experimental burden of ferroelectric polarization vector characterization, while the back-and-forth calibration ensures consistency and reproducibility of 3D polarization reconstruction. An algorithmic workflow is also developed to identify domain walls and calculate their characteristic angles via a spatial vector-angle-difference method, presenting one unique capability enabled by Auto-3DPFM that is not accessible with traditional PFM techniques. Beyond representing a significant step forward in 3D polarization mapping, Auto-3DPFM promises to accelerate discovery via high-throughput and autonomous characterization in ferroelectric materials research.

Significant disparities exist in ADRD diagnosis and care, disproportionately impacting minority and socioeconomically vulnerable populations Objective: In this study, we investigate the relationship between ADRD density and accessibility to healthcare. We identify underserved and overserved areas in Maryland based on diagnosed cases and mortality due to ADRD, focusing on geographic disparities in care. Methods: 2023 Maryland ADRD patients were identified using ICD-10 codes from. Accessibility was measured using the Kernel Density Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (KD2SFCA) method. The Gini index and t-tests were used to analyze disparities between urban and rural areas. Hot Spot Analysis Getis-Ord Gi* and local bivariate relationships analysis were applied to assess spatial correlations. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to calculate the health risk index. Results: Hospital accessibility was unevenly distributed. Mortality rates from ADRD were higher in underserved areas with fewer hospitals. Hot spot analysis shows eastern and southern Maryland have zones with high mortality per population and per ADRD patient, surrounded by similarly high-rate zones. Central Maryland shows lower death rates per patient but more hospital facilities. In eastern Maryland, higher poverty areas are surrounded by zones with lower accessibility and higher health risk indices. Conclusion: Hospital accessibility is unevenly distributed, creating major rural disparities. Underserved regions in terms of access to healthcare facilities, particularly in eastern and southern Maryland, exhibit high ADRD mortality rates despite low diagnosis rates. This suggests that many ADRD cases remain undiagnosed, underdiagnosed, or subject to delayed treatment."

We compare properties including single-photon purity (g2(t)), linewidth, blinking, and photostability. We find that at room temperature, these silane-coated dots perform comparably to the PEAC8C12 passivation in terms of single-photon performance metrics, while exhibiting improvements in photostability. However, we find that at 4K, silane-coated FAPbBr3 quantum dots perform worse than the PEAC8C12-passivated samples, exhibiting faster blue-shifting and photobleaching under illumination. Analysis of fluorescence lifetime intensity distributions from the photon-counting data indicates increased efficiency of fast non-radiative processes in the silane-coated quantum dots at 4K. We propose a trion related degradation pathway at low temperatures that is consistent with the observed kinetics and estimate that at 4K with 6.1 uJ/cm2, 472 nm excitation the silane-coated quantum dots build up double the trion population of their PEAC8C12-passivated counterparts."

The overall maneuver requires coordination between two separately actuated modules of the servicer satellite: (1) a moment generation module and (2) a manipulation module. We apply MPC to control both modules by explicitly modeling the cross-coupling dynamics between them. We demonstrate that the MPC controller can enforce actuation and state constraints that prior control approaches could not account for. We evaluate the performance of the MPC controller by simulating zero-impulse contact scenarios with a free-spinning target satellite via numerical Monte Carlo (MC) trials and comparing the simulation results with prior control approaches. Our simulation results validate the effectiveness of the MPC controller in maintaining spin synchronization and zero-impulse contact under operation constraints, moving contact location, and observation and actuation noise."

Existing RL methods for dLLMs fall short in both aspects: they rely on coarse or unverifiable reward signals, and they estimate prediction probabilities without accounting for the bias relative to the true, unbiased expected prediction probability that properly integrates over all possible decoding orders. To mitigate these issues, we propose \\emph{d}-TreeRPO, a reliable RL framework for dLLMs that leverages tree-structured rollouts and bottom-up advantage computation based on verifiable outcome rewards to provide fine-grained and verifiable step-wise reward signals. When estimating the conditional transition probability from a parent node to a child node, we theoretically analyze the estimation error between the unbiased expected prediction probability and the estimate obtained via a single forward pass, and find that higher prediction confidence leads to lower estimation error. Guided by this analysis, we introduce a time-scheduled self-distillation loss during training that enhances prediction confidence in later training stages, thereby enabling more accurate probability estimation and improved convergence. Experiments show that \\emph{d}-TreeRPO outperforms existing baselines and achieves significant gains on multiple reasoning benchmarks, including +86.2 on Sudoku, +51.6 on Countdown, +4.5 on GSM8K, and +5.3 on Math500. Ablation studies and computational cost analyses further demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our design choices."

In this context, tips are generated from external data sources or analyses of prior satellite imagery, identifying spatiotemporal targets and prioritizing them for downstream planning. Corresponding cues are the imaging tasks formulated in response, which incorporate sensor constraints, timing requirements, and utility functions. The system autonomously generates candidate tasks, optimizes their scheduling across multiple satellites using continuous utility functions that reflect the expected value of each observation, and processes the resulting imagery using artificial-intelligence-based models, including object detectors and vision-language models. Structured visual reports are generated to support both interpretability and the identification of new insights for downstream tasking. The efficacy of the framework is demonstrated through a maritime vessel tracking scenario, utilizing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for trajectory prediction, targeted observations, and the generation of actionable outputs. Maritime vessel tracking is a widely researched application, often used to benchmark novel approaches to satellite tasking, forecasting, and analysis. The system is extensible to broader applications such as smart-city monitoring and disaster response, where timely tasking and automated analysis are critical."

We study the effect of V doping in Ti2C using first principle and Monte-Carlo simulations. Our results show that pristine Ti2C exhibits ferromagnetic intralayer and antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange interactions, yielding an antiferromagnetic ground state. Vanadium incorporation alters these couplings, yet all doped configurations - Ti7VC4 and three Ti6V2C4 variants - retain predominantly antiferromagnetic order. Despite the preserved ground state, V doping enhances the magnetic response, most notably in the p-Ti6V2C4 configuration, which displays increased low-field susceptibility and partial spin alignment across layers. As experimentally isolating individual doped phases is unlikely, samples will consist of mixed configurations whose collective behavior nonetheless exhibits clear signatures of V-induced magnetic modification. These results reveal how transition-metal substitution tunes exchange interactions in MXenes and offer guidance for engineering their magnetic functionalities."

Transformer-based models require substantial resources and labeled data, exacerbating the cold-start problem in target domains where logs are scarce. Existing cross-domain methods leverage source logs but struggle with generalization due to reliance on surface lexical similarity, failing to capture latent semantic equivalence amid structural divergences. To address this, we propose LogICL, a framework distilling Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning into a lightweight encoder for cross-domain anomaly detection. During training, LogICL constructs a delta matrix measuring the utility of demonstrations selected via Maximal Marginal Relevance relative to zero-shot inference. The encoder is optimized via a multi-objective loss comprising an ICL-Guided term that aligns representations based on reasoning assistance utility, maximum mean discrepancy for domain alignment, and supervised contrastive loss. At inference, the optimized encoder retrieves reasoning-aware demonstrations using semantic similarity and delta scores, enabling frozen-LLM in-context learning with Chain-of-Thought for accurate and interpretable detection. Experiments on few-shot and zero-shot cross-domain benchmarks confirm LogICL achieves state-of-the-art performance across heterogeneous systems. Further analysis via visualizations and case studies confirms LogICL bridges the semantic gap beyond surface lexical similarity, effectively capturing latent semantic equivalence for rapid deployment."

Focusing on highway scenarios, this paper proposes a Tripartite Cooperative Semantic Communication (TCSC) framework, which enables Vehicle Users (VUs) to perform semantic task offloading via Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications. Considering task latency and the number of semantic symbols, the framework constructs a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem, which is transformed into two subproblems. First, we innovatively propose a multi-agent proximal policy optimization task offloading optimization method based on parametric distribution noise (MAPPO-PDN) to solve the optimization problem of the number of semantic symbols; second, linear programming (LP) is used to solve offloading ratio. Simulations show that performance of this scheme is superior to that of other algorithms."

    "abstract": "Navigating complex urban environments using natural language instructions poses significant challenges for embodied agents, including noisy language instructions, ambiguous spatial references, diverse landmarks, and dynamic street scenes. Current visual navigation methods are typically limited to simulated or off-street environments, and often rely on precise goal formats, such as specific coordinates or images. This limits their effectiveness for autonomous agents like last-mile delivery robots navigating unfamiliar cities. To address these limitations, we introduce UrbanNav, a scalable framework that trains embodied agents to follow free-form language instructions in diverse urban settings. Leveraging web-scale city walking videos, we develop an scalable annotation pipeline that aligns human navigation trajectories with language instructions grounded in real-world landmarks. UrbanNav encompasses over 1,500 hours of navigation data and 3 million instruction-trajectory-landmark triplets, capturing a wide range of urban scenarios. Our model learns robust navigation policies to tackle complex urban scenarios, demonstrating superior spatial reasoning, robustness to noisy instructions, and generalization to unseen urban settings. Experimental results show that UrbanNav significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the potential of large-scale web video data to enable language-guided, real-world urban navigation for embodied agents."

It turns out they are also elliptic nets, an $n$--dimensional array with values in $K$ satisfying the same nonlinear recurrence relation that division polynomials do as well. Now further assume the elliptic curve $E/K$ has complex multiplication by an order of a quadratic imaginary field $F \\subseteq K$, we will prove a formula for the common valuation of $Φ_{v}$ and $Ψ_{v}^2$ associated to multiples of points by elements of an order in $F$. As an application, we will use the formula to show that elliptic divisibility sequences associated to multiples of points indexed by elements of an order also satisfy a recurrence relation when indexed by elements of an order, subject to certain conditions on the indices.

This has been interpreted as a marker of atmospheric loss from the close-in hot Jupiter WASP-12b and the resulting formation of a gas torus around the star. In this paper we quantify the \\ion{Mg}{ii} absorption from this torus, compared to that provided by the stellar wind, the stellar astrosphere and the ISM. To do this we piece together the full density profile of \\ion{Mg}{ii} from WASP-12 to an observer on Earth using a combination of hydrodynamical simulations and observations. We find that the bulk of the gas along the line of sight is contained within a dense torus close to WASP-12. However, the temperatures in this torus are sufficient to promote Mg into a doubly (\\ion{Mg}{iii}) or higher ionized state. As a result, the singly ionized fraction (\\ion{Mg}{ii}) is low. We find that most of the \\ion{Mg}{ii} is not in the torus but in the ISM. Despite this, the total column density of \\ion{Mg}{ii} is two orders of magnitude lower than required to explain observations of the system. To resolve this discrepancy, we note that the torus gas is at a temperature where it will cool efficiently. We speculate that the onset of the cooling instability will cause the torus to fragment, forming cold clumps with a higher fraction of \\ion{Mg}{ii}, capable of explaining the observed absorption."

Weak anomalies near 4 K are observed in both magnetization and specific heat, indicating the onset of a magnetic transition.The formation of a long-range antiferromagnetic state below 4.5 K is further confirmed by $^{35}$Cl nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. Magnetic susceptibility data reveal nearly isotropic Curie-Weiss temperatures ($\\sim-145$ K) and $g$-factors ($\\sim2.4$) for both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. Moreover, we observe two successive ferroelectric transitions at $T_\\mathrm{FE1}\\sim30$ K and $T_\\mathrm{FE2}\\sim27$ K, driven by inversion-symmetry breaking, most likely associated with distortions in the Cu2O$_4$Cl$_1$ pyramids and the adjacent SO$_4$ tetrahedra.

    "abstract": "Most reinforcement learning(RL)-based methods for drone racing target fixed, obstacle-free tracks, leaving the generalization to unknown, cluttered environments largely unaddressed. This challenge stems from the need to balance racing speed and collision avoidance, limited feasible space causing policy exploration trapped in local optima during training, and perceptual ambiguity between gates and obstacles in depth maps-especially when gate positions are only coarsely specified. To overcome these issues, we propose a two-phase learning framework: an initial soft-collision training phase that preserves policy exploration for high-speed flight, followed by a hard-collision refinement phase that enforces robust obstacle avoidance. An adaptive, noise-augmented curriculum with an asymmetric actor-critic architecture gradually shifts the policy's reliance from privileged gate-state information to depth-based visual input. We further impose Lipschitz constraints and integrate a track-primitive generator to enhance motion stability and cross-environment generalization. We evaluate our framework through extensive simulation and ablation studies, and validate it in real-world experiments on a computationally constrained quadrotor. The system achieves agile flight while remaining robust to gate-position errors, developing a generalizable drone racing framework with the capability to operate in diverse, partially unknown and cluttered environments. https://yufengsjtu.github.io/MasterRacing.github.io/"

Recent advances in generative modelling, including autoregressive, diffusion, and flow-based approaches, have enabled de novo ligand design beyond the limits of enumerative screening. Yet these models often suffer from inadequate generalization, limited interpretability, and an overemphasis on binding affinity at the expense of key pharmacological properties, thereby restricting their translational utility. Here we present Trio, a molecular generation framework integrating fragment-based molecular language modeling, reinforcement learning, and Monte Carlo tree search, for effective and interpretable closed-loop targeted molecular design. Through the three key components, Trio enables context-aware fragment assembly, enforces physicochemical and synthetic feasibility, and guides a balanced search between the exploration of novel chemotypes and the exploitation of promising intermediates within protein binding pockets. Experimental results show that Trio reliably achieves chemically valid and pharmacologically enhanced ligands, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches with improved binding affinity (+7.85%), drug-likeness (+11.10%) and synthetic accessibility (+12.05%), while expanding molecular diversity more than fourfold."

Although graph-based methods such as GraphTunnel achieve strong accuracy, they introduce significant latency and computational overhead due to recursive parsing and graph construction, limiting their suitability for real-time deployment. This work presents DNS-HyXNet, a lightweight extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) hybrid framework designed for efficient sequence-based DNS tunnel detection. DNS-HyXNet integrates tokenized domain embeddings with normalized numerical DNS features and processes them through a two-layer xLSTM network that directly learns temporal dependencies from packet sequences, eliminating the need for graph reconstruction and enabling single-stage multi-class classification. The model was trained and evaluated on two public benchmark datasets with carefully tuned hyperparameters to ensure low memory consumption and fast inference. Across all experimental splits of the DNS-Tunnel-Datasets, DNS-HyXNet achieved up to 99.99% accuracy, with macro-averaged precision, recall, and F1-scores exceeding 99.96%, and demonstrated a per-sample detection latency of just 0.041 ms, confirming its scalability and real-time readiness. These results show that sequential modeling with xLSTM can effectively replace computationally expensive recursive graph generation, offering a deployable and energy-efficient alternative for real-time DNS tunnel detection on commodity hardware."

Here, we successfully grow uniform ferromagnetic Cr2Ge2Te6 films down to monolayer by molecular beam epitaxy. By exploiting a self-limiting growth mode, we achieve synthesis of uniform monolayer Cr2Ge2Te6 films across entire millimeter-scale Si substrates. Through a combination of superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry and anomalous Hall effect measurements, we establish that monolayer Cr2Ge2Te6 exhibits intrinsic ferromagnetism with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy below ~10 K, albeit with strong magnetic fluctuations characteristic of its two-dimensional nature. Furthermore, a systematic thickness-dependent study reveals a crossover from this fluctuation-dominated two-dimensional magnetism turns into conventional long-range ferromagnetic order as the film thickness increases. Our work not only definitively establishes the intrinsic ferromagnetic ground state of monolayer Cr2Ge2Te6, but also provides a scalable, silicon-compatible route for preparing the two-dimensional magnet for future spintronic or quantum devices."

However, their widespread deployment currently suffers from methodological fragmentation and a lack of systematic soundness. This study proposes two comprehensive methodological frameworks designed to guide the strategic and responsible application of LLMs in language sciences. The first method-selection framework defines and systematizes three distinct, complementary approaches, each linked to a specific research goal: (1) prompt-based interaction with general-use models for exploratory analysis and hypothesis generation; (2) fine-tuning of open-source models for confirmatory, theory-driven investigation and high-quality data generation; and (3) extraction of contextualized embeddings for further quantitative analysis and probing of model internal mechanisms. We detail the technical implementation and inherent trade-offs of each method, supported by empirical case studies. Based on the method-selection framework, the second systematic framework proposed provides constructed configurations that guide the practical implementation of multi-stage research pipelines based on these approaches. We then conducted a series of empirical experiments to validate our proposed framework, employing retrospective analysis, prospective application, and an expert evaluation survey. By enforcing the strategic alignment of research questions with the appropriate LLM methodology, the frameworks enable a critical paradigm shift in language science research. We believe that this system is fundamental for ensuring reproducibility, facilitating the critical evaluation of LLM mechanisms, and providing the structure necessary to move traditional linguistics from ad-hoc utility to verifiable, robust science."

This has spurred interest in Small Language Models (SLMs), but their practical effectiveness and efficiency within complex agentic frameworks for automated issue resolution remain poorly understood. Goal. We investigate the performance, energy efficiency, and resource consumption of four leading agentic issue resolution frameworks when deliberately constrained to using SLMs. We aim to assess the viability of these systems for this task in resource-limited settings and characterize the resulting trade-offs. Method. We conduct a controlled evaluation of four leading agentic frameworks (SWE-Agent, OpenHands, Mini SWE Agent, AutoCodeRover) using two SLMs (Gemma-3 4B, Qwen-3 1.7B) on the SWE-bench Verified Mini benchmark. On fixed hardware, we measure energy, duration, token usage, and memory over 150 runs per configuration. Results. We find that framework architecture is the primary driver of energy consumption. The most energy-intensive framework, AutoCodeRover (Gemma), consumed 9.4x more energy on average than the least energy-intensive, OpenHands (Gemma). However, this energy is largely wasted. Task resolution rates were near-zero, demonstrating that current frameworks, when paired with SLMs, consume significant energy on unproductive reasoning loops. The SLM's limited reasoning was the bottleneck for success, but the framework's design was the bottleneck for efficiency. Conclusions. Current agentic frameworks, designed for powerful LLMs, fail to operate efficiently with SLMs. We find that framework architecture is the primary driver of energy consumption, but this energy is largely wasted due to the SLMs' limited reasoning. Viable low-energy solutions require shifting from passive orchestration to architectures that actively manage SLM weaknesses."

We introduce a new family of methods that employ beam search to generate candidates for consistency-based UQ, yielding improved performance and reduced variance compared to multinomial sampling. We also provide a theoretical lower bound on the beam set probability mass under which beam search achieves a smaller error than multinomial sampling.

    "abstract": "For more than fourty years, the quest to understand how large-scale magnetic fields emerge from turbulent flows in rotating astrophysical systems, such as the Sun, has been a major thread of computational astrophysics research. Using a parameter scan and phenomenological analysis of maximally-simplified three-dimensional cartesian magnetohydrodynamic simulations of large-scale nonlinear helical turbulent dynamos, I present results in this Letter that strongly point to an asymptotic ultimate regime of the large-scale solar dynamo, at large magnetic Reynolds numbers $Rm$, involving helicity fluxes between hemispheres. I obtained corresponding numerical solutions at both $Pm>1$ and $Pm<1$, and show that they can currently only be achieved in clean, simplified numerical setups. The analysis further strongly suggests that all global simulations to date lie in a non-asymptotic turbulent MHD regimes highly sensitive to changes in kinetic and magnetic Reynolds numbers. Ideas are presented to attempt to reach this ultimate regime in such \"realistic\" global spherical models at a reasonable numerical cost. Overall, the results clarify the current state, and some hard limitations of the brute-force numerical modelling approach applied to this, and other similar astrophysical turbulence problems."

By numerical simulation we show that the four-wave mixing of the polaritons with the coherent drive produces the free propagating polaritons that can mediate the inter-condensate interaction resulting in the phase-locking of the condensates."

    "abstract": "The bar/bulge and inner disk are fundamental building blocks of the Milky Way, containing a large fraction of its stellar mass. However, stars in these regions are faint, crowded, and have high extinction, which makes studying their formation and evolution challenging. Using the integral-field spectrograph MUSE with adaptive-optics on the Very Large Telescope, we overcome these limitations and measure accurate ages, chemical abundances, and line-of-sight velocities for 98 main-sequence turn-off and subgiant branch stars with $R_{gc}<3.5$ kpc in Baade's Window. We find that 17% stars have ages younger than 5 Gyr, and the age distribution reveals multiple peaks at 3.1, 4.8, 7.6, and 10.8 Gyr, indicating that star formation in the inner Galaxy occurred in multiple episodes. These stars are predominantly metal-rich but span a broad metallicity range ($-1.2<$[Fe/H]$<+0.6$). The [$α$/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution shows both $α$-rich and $α$-poor sequences, with most stars being metal-rich and low-[$α$/Fe]. Our results demonstrate that IFUs enable reliable measurements of stellar parameters even in the most crowded regions of the Milky Way, opening a new pathway to study the chemodynamical evolution of the inner Galaxy."

    "abstract": "Neural decoding, a critical component of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), has recently attracted increasing research interest. Previous research has focused on leveraging signal processing and deep learning methods to enhance neural decoding performance. However, the in-depth exploration of model architectures remains underexplored, despite its proven effectiveness in other tasks such as energy forecasting and image classification. In this study, we propose NeuroSketch, an effective framework for neural decoding via systematic architecture optimization. Starting with the basic architecture study, we find that CNN-2D outperforms other architectures in neural decoding tasks and explore its effectiveness from temporal and spatial perspectives. Building on this, we optimize the architecture from macro- to micro-level, achieving improvements in performance at each step. The exploration process and model validations take over 5,000 experiments spanning three distinct modalities (visual, auditory, and speech), three types of brain signals (EEG, SEEG, and ECoG), and eight diverse decoding tasks. Experimental results indicate that NeuroSketch achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all evaluated datasets, positioning it as a powerful tool for neural decoding.

Disentangled component spectra allow a detailed analysis of a component's magnetic activity. We aim at separating the spectra of the two stellar components of the HR\\,7275 SB2 system. Our further aim is a more accurate orbital solution by cleaning the observed radial velocities (RV) from activity perturbations of the spotted primary (\"RV jitter\") and obtain a surface image of this component. The Doppler image of the primary shows two large cool spots of size $\\approx$20\\% of the visible hemisphere plus three smaller spots, each still $\\approx$13\\% in size. In total, HR\\,7275a exhibited an impressive spottedness of $\\approx$40\\%\\ of its entire surface in May-June 2022. The RV is modulated by the rotation of the primary with maximum amplitudes of 320\\,\\ms\\ and 650\\,\\ms\\ for two different modulation behaviors during the 250\\,d of our observations. This jitter is primarily caused by the varying asymmetries of the apparent disk brightness due to the cool spots. Its removal resulted in roughly ten times higher precision of the orbital elements. Our snapshot magnetic-field measurements reveal phase-dependent (large-scale) surface fields between +0.6$\\pm$2.0\\,G at phase 0.1 and $-$15.2$\\pm$2.7\\,G at phase 0.6, indicating a complex magnetic morphology related to the location of the photospheric spots. We also obtain a logarithmic lithium abundance of 0.58$\\pm$0.1 for HR\\,7275a, indicating considerable mixing, and 0.16$^{+0.23}_{-0.63}$ for HR\\,7275b, which is an extremely low value. }"

    "abstract": "Large language models are increasingly deployed across the financial sector for tasks such as research, compliance, risk analysis, and customer service, which makes rigorous safety evaluation essential. However, existing financial benchmarks primarily focus on textbook-style question answering and numerical problem solving, but fail to evaluate models' real-world safety behaviors. They weakly assess regulatory compliance and investor-protection norms, rarely stress-test multi-turn adversarial tactics such as jailbreaks or prompt injection, inconsistently ground answers in long filings, ignore tool- or RAG-induced over-reach risks, and rely on opaque or non-auditable evaluation protocols. To close these gaps, we introduce CNFinBench, a benchmark that employs finance-tailored red-team dialogues and is structured around a Capability-Compliance-Safety triad, including evidence-grounded reasoning over long reports and jurisdiction-aware rule/tax compliance tasks. For systematic safety quantification, we introduce the Harmful Instruction Compliance Score (HICS) to measure how consistently models resist harmful prompts across multi-turn adversarial dialogues. To ensure auditability, CNFinBench enforces strict output formats with dynamic option perturbation for objective tasks and employs a hybrid LLM-ensemble plus human-calibrated judge for open-ended evaluations. Experiments on 21 models across 15 subtasks confirm a persistent capability-compliance gap: models achieve an average score of 61.0 on capability tasks but fall to 34.18 on compliance and risk-control evaluations. Under multi-turn adversarial dialogue tests, most systems reach only partial resistance (HICS 60-79), demonstrating that refusal alone is not a reliable proxy for safety without cited and verifiable reasoning."

For fine-grained control during inference, we introduce chained classifier-free guidance (cCFG) trained with hierarchical condition dropout, enabling independent adjustment of content, timbre, and style guidance strengths. Additionally, we employ Representation Alignment (REPA) to distill acoustic-semantic features from a pretrained Whisper model into intermediate DiT representations, stabilizing training and accelerating convergence.

    "abstract": "Recently, infrared small target detection has attracted extensive attention. However, due to the small size and the lack of intrinsic features of infrared small targets, the existing methods generally have the problem of inaccurate edge positioning and the target is easily submerged by the background. Therefore, we propose an innovative gradient-guided learning network (GGL-Net). Specifically, we are the first to explore the introduction of gradient magnitude images into the deep learning-based infrared small target detection method, which is conducive to emphasizing the edge details and alleviating the problem of inaccurate edge positioning of small targets. On this basis, we propose a novel dual-branch feature extraction network that utilizes the proposed gradient supplementary module (GSM) to encode raw gradient information into deeper network layers and embeds attention mechanisms reasonably to enhance feature extraction ability. In addition, we construct a two-way guidance fusion module (TGFM), which fully considers the characteristics of feature maps at different levels. It can facilitate the effective fusion of multi-scale feature maps and extract richer semantic information and detailed information through reasonable two-way guidance. Extensive experiments prove that GGL-Net has achieves state-of-the-art results on the public real NUAA-SIRST dataset and the public synthetic NUDT-SIRST dataset.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates non-parametric knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), typically from unstructured texts and structured graphs. While recent progress has advanced text-based RAG to multi-turn reasoning through Reinforcement Learning (RL), extending these advances to hybrid retrieval introduces additional challenges. Existing graph-based or hybrid systems typically depend on fixed or handcrafted retrieval pipelines, lacking the ability to integrate supplementary evidence as reasoning unfolds. Besides, while graph evidence provides relational structures crucial for multi-hop reasoning, it is substantially more expensive to retrieve. To address these limitations, we introduce \\model{}, an RL-based framework that enables LLMs to perform multi-turn and adaptive graph-text hybrid RAG. \\model{} jointly optimizes the entire generation process via RL, allowing the model to learn when to reason, what to retrieve from either texts or graphs, and when to produce final answers, all within a unified generation policy. To guide this learning process, we design a two-stage training framework that accounts for both task outcome and retrieval efficiency, enabling the model to exploit hybrid evidence while avoiding unnecessary retrieval overhead. Experimental results across five question answering benchmarks demonstrate that \\model{} significantly outperforms existing RAG baselines, highlighting the benefits of end-to-end RL in supporting adaptive and efficient retrieval for complex reasoning."

The comparison between the current measurements and the image analysis exposes a strong correlation between the fast excitation and ionization wave velocity and the rising current velocity. This correlation has been found only for diffuse mode discharge since a front wave could be clearly defined, denoted as the luminous propagation front (LPF).

To address the limitations of traditional financial decision methods that rely on parameterized knowledge, lack factual consistency, and miss reasoning chains, an integrated framework is proposed that combines external knowledge retrieval, semantic representation, and reasoning generation. The method first encodes financial texts and structured data to obtain semantic representations, and then retrieves task-related information from external knowledge bases using similarity computation. Internal representations and external knowledge are combined through weighted fusion, which ensures fluency while improving factual accuracy and completeness of generated content. In the reasoning stage, a multi-head attention mechanism is introduced to construct logical chains, allowing the model to present transparent causal relationships and traceability during generation. Finally, the model jointly optimizes task objectives and explanation consistency objectives, which enhances predictive performance and reasoning interpretability. Experiments on financial text processing and decision tasks show that the method outperforms baseline approaches in accuracy, text generation quality, and factual support, verifying the effectiveness of knowledge enhancement and explainable reasoning. Overall, the proposed approach overcomes the limitations of traditional models in semantic coverage and reasoning transparency, and demonstrates strong practical value in complex financial scenarios."

RoboCup, an international competition of fully autonomous humanoid robots, provides a uniquely challenging benchmark for such systems, culminating in the long-term goal of competing against human soccer players by 2050. This paper presents the hardware and software innovations underlying our team's victory in the RoboCup 2024 Adult-Sized Humanoid Soccer Competition. On the hardware side, we introduce an adult-sized humanoid platform built with lightweight structural components, high-torque quasi-direct-drive actuators, and a specialized foot design that enables powerful in-gait kicks while preserving locomotion robustness. On the software side, we develop an integrated perception and localization framework that combines stereo vision, object detection, and landmark-based fusion to provide reliable estimates of the ball, goals, teammates, and opponents. A mid-level navigation stack then generates collision-aware, dynamically feasible trajectories, while a centralized behavior manager coordinates high-level decision making, role selection, and kick execution based on the evolving game state. The seamless integration of these subsystems results in fast, precise, and tactically effective gameplay, enabling robust performance under the dynamic and adversarial conditions of real matches.

At experimentally feasible temperatures, we predict that key features of the Kondo effect can be observed, including formation of the Kondo cloud around a single impurity and the competition of singlet formation with Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions for multiple impurities, summarized in the Doniach phase diagram. Moreover, we show that the mixD platform provides a natural bridge between the Doniach phase diagram of the Kondo lattice model, relevant to heavy-fermion materials, and the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors as described by a single-layer Zhang-Rice type $t$-$J$ model: It is possible to continuously tune between the two regimes by changing the interlayer Kondo coupling.

    "abstract": "Radiance field representations have recently been explored in the latent space of VAEs that are commonly used by diffusion models. This direction offers efficient rendering and seamless integration with diffusion-based pipelines. However, these methods face a fundamental limitation: The VAE latent space lacks multi-view consistency, leading to blurred textures and missing details during 3D reconstruction. Existing approaches attempt to address this by fine-tuning the VAE, at the cost of reconstruction quality, or by relying on pre-trained diffusion models to recover fine-grained details, at the risk of some hallucinations. We present Splatent, a diffusion-based enhancement framework designed to operate on top of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in the latent space of VAEs. Our key insight departs from the conventional 3D-centric view: rather than reconstructing fine-grained details in 3D space, we recover them in 2D from input views through multi-view attention mechanisms. This approach preserves the reconstruction quality of pretrained VAEs while achieving faithful detail recovery. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, Splatent establishes a new state-of-the-art for VAE latent radiance field reconstruction. We further demonstrate that integrating our method with existing feed-forward frameworks, consistently improves detail preservation, opening new possibilities for high-quality sparse-view 3D reconstruction."

    "abstract": "We study the photon emission by charged spinless particles with phase vortices and an orbital angular momentum (OAM) projection in longitudinal electric and magnetic fields within the scalar QED. A realistic wave packet of an electron or ion accelerated by a radio-frequency wave locally feels a constant and spatially homogeneous field, which allows us to develop an effective model for losing the angular momentum of the vortex particle due to photon emission. For the fields typical for accelerator facilities, we find that an effective lifetime of the vortex state greatly exceeds the acceleration time. This proves that the acceleration of vortex electrons, ions, muons, and so forth to relativistic energies is possible in conventional linacs, as well as in the wake-field accelerators with higher field gradients, the OAM losses due to the photon emission are mostly negligible, and that the vortex quantum state is highly robust against these losses."

    "abstract": "Towards human-robot coexistence, socially aware navigation is significant for mobile robots. Yet existing studies on this area focus mainly on path efficiency and pedestrian collision avoidance, which are essential but represent only a fraction of social navigation. Beyond these basics, robots must also comply with user instructions, aligning their actions to task goals and social norms expressed by humans. In this work, we present LISN-Bench, the first simulation-based benchmark for language-instructed social navigation. Built on Rosnav-Arena 3.0, it is the first standardized social navigation benchmark to incorporate instruction following and scene understanding across diverse contexts. To address this task, we further propose Social-Nav-Modulator, a fast-slow hierarchical system where a VLM agent modulates costmaps and controller parameters. Decoupling low-level action generation from the slower VLM loop reduces reliance on high-frequency VLM inference while improving dynamic avoidance and perception adaptability. Our method achieves an average success rate of 91.3%, which is greater than 63% than the most competitive baseline, with most of the improvements observed in challenging tasks such as following a person in a crowd and navigating while strictly avoiding instruction-forbidden regions.

A series of thermo-fluid simulations of a bevel-helical gear reducer were conducted by varying shaft speed, oil immersion depth, and lubricant viscosity to evaluate their influence on splash dynamics, churning losses, and lubricant temperature rise. The results show that churning losses increase by nearly an order of magnitude as the speed rises from 150 to 600 rad/s, while the corresponding lubricant temperature rise becomes approximately three to four times smaller. Variations in immersion depth and viscosity adjust the heating rate only modestly-typically within 10-20%-with their influence reversing between low- and high-speed regimes. The GPU backend provides a 7-9 speedup over a high-performance desktop CPU, enabling multi-million-particle, full-gearbox thermo-fluid simulations without specialized hardware. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of high-fidelity thermal analysis of industrial gearboxes and provide quantitative insight into the coupled splash, churning, and heat-transfer mechanisms that govern gearbox thermal performance."

However, the extent to which different model architectures capture antibody-specific biological properties remains unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate how architectural choices in PLMs influence their ability to comprehend antibody sequence characteristics and functions. We evaluate three state-of-the-art PLMs-AntiBERTa, BioBERT, and ESM2--against a general-purpose language model (GPT-2) baseline on antibody target specificity prediction tasks. Our results demonstrate that while all PLMs achieve high classification accuracy, they exhibit distinct biases in capturing biological features such as V gene usage, somatic hypermutation patterns, and isotype information. Through attention attribution analysis, we show that antibody-specific models like AntiBERTa naturally learn to focus on complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), while general protein models benefit significantly from explicit CDR-focused training strategies. These findings provide insights into the relationship between model architecture and biological feature extraction, offering valuable guidance for future PLM development in computational antibody design."

    "abstract": "Classical array processing methods such as the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) provide statistically grounded solutions for signal detection and direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation, but their high computational cost limits their use in low-latency settings. Deep learning (DL) has recently emerged as an efficient alternative, offering fast inference for array processing tasks. However, DL models lack statistical guarantees and, moreover, are highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, raising fundamental concerns about their reliability in adversarial wireless environments. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarially resilient speculative array processing framework that consists of a low-latency DL classifier backed by a theoretically-grounded GLRT validator, where DL is used for fast speculative inference and later confirmed with the GLRT. We show that second order statistics of the received array, which the GLRT operates on, are spatially invariant to L-p bounded adversarial perturbations, providing adversarial robustness and theoretically-grounded validation of DL predictions. Empirical evaluations under multiple L-p bounds, perturbation designs, and perturbation magnitudes corroborate our theoretical findings, demonstrating the superior performance of our proposed framework in comparison to multiple state-of-the-art baselines."

    "abstract": "Outflows are one of the most spectacular mechanisms through which active galactic nuclei (AGN) impact their host galaxy, though the role of AGN-driven outflows in global star formation regulation across the galaxy population is unclear. NGC 1266 is an excellent case study for investigating the outflows and star formation quenching because it is a nearby (D\\sim30 Mpc) AGN host galaxy with an outflow driving shocks through the interstellar medium (ISM) and has recently quenched its star formation outside the nucleus. While previous works have studied the molecular outflow from its CO emission, to fully characterize the impact the outflow has on the ISM observations probing the dense, cold gas are necessary. Our ALMA cycle 0 observations do not detect a molecular outflow in 13CO(2-1) and yield a lower limit 12CO/13CO \\geq 250, suggesting a highly optically thin CO outflow with low 13CO abundance. In contrast, we detect substantial HCN(1-0) emission in the outflow, with an HCN(1-0)/12CO(1-0) ratio of 0.09, consistent with global measurements of many star-forming galaxies and Luminous InfraRed Galaxies (LIRGs). We conclude that the CO emission traces a diffuse component of the molecular gas with a low optical depth, whereas the HCN(1-0) traces dense clumps of gas entrained in the outflow. We measure an upper limit molecular outflow rate of < 85 Msun/yr. Assuming the ongoing nuclear star formation and outflow continue at the same rates, NGC 1266 will deplete its gas reservoirs in 450 Myr or longer, indicating that relatively low-level AGN feedback is capable of gradually expelling the molecular gas reservoir after a rapid quenching event."

In our comparative study, ARTEMIS placed second overall, discovering 9 valid vulnerabilities with an 82% valid submission rate and outperforming 9 of 10 human participants. While existing scaffolds such as Codex and CyAgent underperformed relative to most human participants, ARTEMIS demonstrated technical sophistication and submission quality comparable to the strongest participants. We observe that AI agents offer advantages in systematic enumeration, parallel exploitation, and cost -- certain ARTEMIS variants cost $18/hour versus $60/hour for professional penetration testers. We also identify key capability gaps: AI agents exhibit higher false-positive rates and struggle with GUI-based tasks."

The novelty of this platform lies in its direct access to the reciprocal space, which enables us to scan the quasi-momentum across the entire Brillouin zone and thus achieve a precise tomographic reconstruction of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, indicated by the comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements. From the inferred Hamiltonian, it is possible to retrieve complex-valued band structures, resolve exceptional points in momentum space, and detect the associated parity-time symmetry breaking through eigenvector coalescence. Our results, presented entirely in quasi-momentum space, represent a substantial shift in perspective in the study of non-Hermitian phenomena."

For more than 700 asteroids from two catalogues, the Johnston Archive [Johnston, 2024] and the Gaia DR3 VizieR list of binary candidates from Liberato et al. [2024], we applied a resonance identification algorithm, treating all planetary perturbations. Our results showed that the presence of binary asteroids in MMRs largely depends on their dynamical class. The highest percentage, more than 30%, is found in the Trans- Neptunian region, where most of these objects have exhibited resonant librations longer than 10 Myr. For the main-belt asteroid pairs, this percentage is about 10-12%. Contrary to expectations, the more unstable region populated with NEOs, showed a higher percentage of resonant pairs (above 17%), but with temporal resonant captures. These results could indicate that the mean motion resonances, particularly the stronger ones, could play a role in the evolution and formation of binary systems. Finally, we highlight that in the present paper, 82 resonant binary asteroids are newly identified."

See-through-skin (STS) sensors, which combine tactile and visual perception, offer promising sensing capabilities, while modern imitation learning provides powerful tools for policy acquisition. However, existing STS designs lack simultaneous multimodal perception and suffer from unreliable tactile tracking. Furthermore, integrating these rich multimodal signals into learning-based manipulation pipelines remains an open challenge. We introduce TacThru, an STS sensor enabling simultaneous visual perception and robust tactile signal extraction, and TacThru-UMI, an imitation learning framework that leverages these multimodal signals for manipulation. Our sensor features a fully transparent elastomer, persistent illumination, novel keyline markers, and efficient tracking, while our learning system integrates these signals through a Transformer-based Diffusion Policy. Experiments on five challenging real-world tasks show that TacThru-UMI achieves an average success rate of 85.5%, significantly outperforming the baselines of alternating tactile-visual (66.3%) and vision-only (55.4%). The system excels in critical scenarios, including contact detection with thin and soft objects and precision manipulation requiring multimodal coordination. This work demonstrates that combining simultaneous multimodal perception with modern learning frameworks enables more precise, adaptable robotic manipulation."

By solving this equation numerically, we analyse both physical and geometric properties of these charged fluid spheres for different values of $n$ and $Γ$. By imposing subluminal sound speeds and energy conditions, we restrict ourselves to configurations that are physically acceptable. Then, within these physical models, we study internal trapping of circular geodesics and find the trapping regions in the $n$-$Γ$ parameter space. Going beyond the traditionally studied case of null geodesics, we consider orbits of charged and/or massive particles. We show that for neutral null particles (and only for them), their trapping depends purely on the properties of the space-time. In the other three cases, properties such as the particle's own charge and/or energy also play a role. In general, we find that trapping of all types of particles is allowed for a broad range of $n$ and $Γ$."

    "abstract": "California's wildfire season keeps getting worse over the years, overwhelming the emergency response teams. These fires cause massive destruction to both property and human life. Because of these reasons, there's a growing need for accurate and practical predictions that can help assist with resources allocation for the Wildfire managers or the response teams. In this research, we built machine learning models to predict the number of days it will require to fully contain a wildfire in California. Here, we addressed an important gap in the current literature. Most prior research has concentrated on wildfire risk or how fires spread, and the few that examine the duration typically predict it in broader categories rather than a continuous measure. This research treats the wildfire duration prediction as a regression task, which allows for more detailed and precise forecasts rather than just the broader categorical predictions used in prior work. We built the models by combining three publicly available datasets from California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP). This study compared the performance of baseline ensemble regressor, Random Forest and XGBoost, with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The results show that the XGBoost model slightly outperforms the Random Forest model, likely due to its superior handling of static features in the dataset. The LSTM model, on the other hand, performed worse than the ensemble models because the dataset lacked temporal features. Overall, this study shows that, depending on the feature availability, Wildfire managers or Fire management authorities can select the most appropriate model to accurately predict wildfire containment duration and allocate resources effectively."

It adopts a hierarchical binder structure for cross-attention conditioning in Diffusion Transformers to encode visual concepts into corresponding prompt tokens for accurate decomposition of complex visual concepts. To improve concept-token binding accuracy, we design a Diversify-and-Absorb Mechanism that uses an extra absorbent token to eliminate the impact of concept-irrelevant details when training with diversified prompts. To enhance the compatibility between image and video concepts, we present a Temporal Disentanglement Strategy that decouples the training process of video concepts into two stages with a dual-branch binder structure for temporal modeling.

    "abstract": "Evidence synthesis has advanced through improved reporting standards, bias assessment tools, and analytic methods, but current workflows remain limited by a single-layer structure in which conceptual, methodological, and procedural decisions are made on the same level. This forces each project to rebuild its methodological foundations from scratch, leading to inconsistencies, conceptual drift, and unstable reasoning across projects. RECAP Framework v1.0 introduces a three-layer meta-architecture consisting of methodological laws (Grandparent), domain-level abstractions (Parent), and project-level implementations (Child). The framework defines an inheritance system with strict rules for tiering, routing, and contamination control to preserve construct clarity, enforce inferential discipline, and support reproducibility across multi-project evidence ecosystems. RECAP provides a formal governance layer for evidence synthesis and establishes the foundation for a methodological lineage designed to stabilize reasoning across research programs."

    "abstract": "Personalized Text-to-Image (PT2I) generation aims to produce customized images based on reference images. A prominent interest pertains to the integration of an image prompt adapter to facilitate zero-shot PT2I without test-time fine-tuning. However, current methods grapple with three fundamental challenges: 1. the elusive equilibrium between Concept Preservation (CP) and Prompt Following (PF), 2. the difficulty in retaining fine-grained concept details in reference images, and 3. the restricted scalability to extend to multi-subject personalization. To tackle these challenges, we present Dynamic Image Prompt Adapter (DynaIP), a cutting-edge plugin to enhance the fine-grained concept fidelity, CP-PF balance, and subject scalability of SOTA T2I multimodal diffusion transformers (MM-DiT) for PT2I generation. Our key finding is that MM-DiT inherently exhibit decoupling learning behavior when injecting reference image features into its dual branches via cross attentions. Based on this, we design an innovative Dynamic Decoupling Strategy that removes the interference of concept-agnostic information during inference, significantly enhancing the CP-PF balance and further bolstering the scalability of multi-subject compositions. Moreover, we identify the visual encoder as a key factor affecting fine-grained CP and reveal that the hierarchical features of commonly used CLIP can capture visual information at diverse granularity levels. Therefore, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts Feature Fusion Module to fully leverage the hierarchical features of CLIP, remarkably elevating the fine-grained concept fidelity while also providing flexible control of visual granularity. Extensive experiments across single- and multi-subject PT2I tasks verify that our DynaIP outperforms existing approaches, marking a notable advancement in the field of PT2l generation."

    "abstract": "We develop a general and unconditional framework for certifying the global nonnegativity of multivariate integer polynomials; based on rewriting them as sum of squares modulo their gradient ideals. We remove the two structural assumptions typically required by other approaches, namely that the polynomial attains its infimum and zero-dimensionality of the gradient ideal. Our approach combines a denominator-free stereographic transformation with a refined variant of the Hanzon--Jibetean perturbation scheme. The stereographic transformation preserves nonnegativity while making the polynomial coercive, with explicit bounds on the radius of positivity and on the nonzero critical values. Subsequently, we apply carefully constructed explicit perturbations that enforce zero-dimensionality of the gradient ideal without altering nonnegativity, allowing us to invoke recent algorithms to derive algebraic certificates or rational witness points. We present three algorithms implementing our framework and analyze their bit complexity in detail, which is single exponential with respect to the number of variables. A second contribution is a new explicit SOS perturbation scheme, which allows us to perturb any nonnegative polynomial in such a way that it can be written as a sum of squares (SOS). In contrast to Lasserre's classical SOS approximation, which guaranties density but currently does not provide an effective control over the perturbation size, we only derive concrete perturbation bounds ensuring that a nonnegative polynomial enters the SOS cone."

With the exception of configurations where one input is located at an endpoint, cases already well studied in the literature, all admissible two-inputs configurations are treated in this paper within a unified framework. The proposed approach relies on a backstepping transformation combined with a reformulation of the closed-loop dynamics as an Integral Difference Equation (IDE). This IDE representation reveals a common structural pattern across configurations and clarifies the role played by delayed dynamics in the stability analysis. Within this formulation, the stabilization problem can be handled using existing IDE control techniques. For most configurations, the stabilization of the PDE system requires an approximate spectral controllability assumption. Remarkably, one specific configuration can be stabilized without imposing any additional spectral condition. In contrast, we also provide an explicit example of a configuration for which the required spectral controllability property fails to hold."

Calculations have been performed by propagating the time-dependent Schr{ö}dinger equation with complex energies, in order to account for ionization of the system, and by using tailored Gaussian basis sets for high-energy and continuum states. We have studied the strong-field electron dynamics and the HHG spectra in aligned CO2 and H2O molecules. Contribution from MOs in the strong-field dynamics depends on the interplay between the MO ionization energy and the coupling between the MO and the laser-pulse symmetries. Such contributions characterize different portions of the HHG spectrum, indicating that the orbital decomposition encodes nontrivial information on the modulation of the strong-field dynamics. Our results correctly reproduce the MO contributions to HHG for CO2 as described in the literature experimental and theoretical data and lead to an original analysis of the role of the highest occupied molecular orbitals HOMO, HOMO-1, and HOMO-2 of H2O according to the polarization direction of the laser pulse."

Given oracle access to $e^{-itH}$ for an unknown $k$-local Hamiltonian $H$ and a fully specified target Hamiltonian $H_0$, the goal is to decide whether $H$ is exactly equal to $H_0$ or differs from $H_0$ by at least $\\varepsilon$ in normalized Frobenius norm, while minimizing the total evolution time. We introduce the first intolerant Hamiltonian certification protocol that achieves optimal performance for all constant-locality Hamiltonians. For general $n$-qubit, $k$-local, traceless Hamiltonians, our procedure uses $O(c^k/\\varepsilon)$ total evolution time for a universal constant $c$, and succeeds with high probability. In particular, for $O(1)$-local Hamiltonians, the total evolution time becomes $Θ(1/\\varepsilon)$, matching the known $Ω(1/\\varepsilon)$ lower bounds and achieving the gold-standard Heisenberg-limit scaling. Prior certification methods either relied on implementing inverse evolution of $H$, required controlled access to $e^{-itH}$, or achieved near-optimal guarantees only in restricted settings such as the Ising case ($k=2$). In contrast, our algorithm requires neither inverse evolution nor controlled operations: it uses only forward real-time dynamics and achieves optimal intolerant certification for all constant-locality Hamiltonians."

While most existing work focuses on the nullity of a signed graph (the multiplicity of the eigenvalue $0$), much less is known for arbitrary eigenvalues. In this paper, we establish a sharp upper bound for the multiplicity $m(G_σ, λ)$ of any real eigenvalue $λ$ of a connected signed graph $G_σ$ in terms of its girth. Our main result shows that \\[ m(G_σ, λ) \\le n - g(G_σ) + 2, \\] where $n$ is the number of vertices and $g(G_σ)$ is the girth. We prove that equality holds if and only if $G_σ$ is switching equivalent to one of the following extremal families: \\begin{itemize} \\item[(i)] a balanced complete graph with $λ= -1$; \\item[(ii)] an antibalanced complete graph with $λ= 1$; or \\item[(iii)] a balanced complete bipartite graph with $λ= 0$. \\end{itemize} This fully extends and generalizes the known result for the nullity case ($λ= 0$), originally due to Wu et al.\\ (2022), to the entire eigenvalue spectrum. Our approach combines Cauchy interlacing, switching equivalence, and a structural analysis of induced cycles in signed graphs. We also provide a characterization of eigenvalues with multiplicity $1$ and $2$ for signed cycles, and include examples illustrating the sharpness and spectral behavior of the extremal families."

In our proposal, the transition briefly reshapes the ALP potential via a temperature-dependent vacuum expectation value of a scalar field $S$, responsible for making the EWPT of first order, inducing a transient mass enhancement of ALP via higher-dimensional $U(1)$-breaking operator(s). This sudden kick generates a large ALP velocity near the onset of EWPT enabling the broadening of relic satisfied parameter space and predict a complementary stochastic gravitational-wave signal from the underlying first-order transition. We further show that the same ALP dynamics can naturally fuel electroweak baryogenesis through its coupling to electroweak anomaly."

We interpret the results in terms of a molecular Bose gas in quasi-two-dimensional confinement and compare them with theoretical predictions for a weakly interacting two-dimensional Bose gas, identifying the range of validity of mean-field and beyond-mean-field descriptions.

Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ has been widely regarded as a leading candidate, yet the nature of its phase transition and insulating state remains controversial. Here, we report a systematic Raman spectroscopy study of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ as a function of thickness and field-effect doping, complemented by electrical transport measurements. The phase transition persists down to the monolayer limit, with the critical temperature increasing as thickness decreases. In bilayer samples, both electron and hole doping suppress the insulating state, with electron doping lowering and hole doping raising the transition temperature. Importantly, the quasi-elastic scattering, previously attributed to excitonic fluctuations, evolves monotonically across the entire doping range, inconsistent with the expected suppression of excitonic correlations by Coulomb screening. These findings rule out a dominant excitonic mechanism and instead point to a coupled electronic and structural phase transition, whose stability is tunable by carrier doping. Our doping-based approach offers a general strategy for evaluating the role of excitonic effects in candidate excitonic insulators."

    "abstract": "Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey have reignited the debate on the true nature of dark energy, challenging the standard cosmological constant model of cosmology. The results suggest a preference for dark energy to be dynamical rather than a cosmological constant. Several recent analyses of DESI data indicate that the universe's expansion may not be accelerating in the way suggested by supernova based cosmology. Motivated by these studies, we investigated a tachyon type scalar field $φ$ as a model for dark energy, assuming an exponential potential for the field and performed parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Such a model offers solutions that have $w \\sim -1$ and are decelerating without requiring a phantom like equation of state. The present day value of the equation of state parameter is treated as a free parameter; however, for the reference model, we fix its present value to $-1$. The analysis is carried out using the latest Supernovae dataset (Pantheon+) and BAO measurements from DESI. The results show that both types of datasets consistently predict a turnaround in the equation of state, regardless of whether $w_{φ0}$ is treated as a free parameter or fixed to $-1$. The corresponding deceleration parameter also exhibits a future turnaround for both datasets when $w_{φ0}$ is free. However, in the reference model with $w_{φ0} = -1$, the deceleration parameter instead approaches $-1$ asymptotically. A model comparison using the Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria shows that the Pantheon+ dataset favors the free $w_{φ0}$ scenario, while BAO observations prefer the $w_{φ0} = -1$ case. This indicates a disagreement in the future evolution trends predicted by the two datasets within the tachyon type dark energy model."

This forms a coupled system comprising an ODE and the initial boundary value problem (IBVP) of a hyperbolic system with characteristic boundary in a moving domain, where the fluid velocity matches the solid velocity along the normal direction of the solid boundary. We establish the existence of a unique local classical solution to this coupled system. To construct the solution, we first perform a change of variables to reformulate the problem in a fixed spatial domain, and then analyze an approximate system with a non-characteristic boundary. For this nonlinear approximate system, we use the better regularity for the trace of the pressure on the boundary to contruct a solution by a fixed-point argument in which the fluid motion and the solid motion are updated in successive steps. We are then able to derive estimates independent of the regularization parameter and to pass to the limit by a strong compactness arguments."

We systematically study three fundamental factors: (1) the relationship between solution optimality and execution performance, (2) the sensitivity of system performance to inaccuracies in kinodynamic modeling, and (3) the interaction between model accuracy and plan optimality.

    "abstract": "Low-mode baroclinic tides play a major role in ocean dynamics, especially for energy redistribution and deep ocean mixing. These internal waves, generated by tidal flow over submarine topography, can propagate for thousands of kilometres across ocean basins, and become unstable through wave-mean flow or wave-wave interactions. Satellite observations of internal tides have shown that part of their lunar semidiurnal (M2) altimetry signal loses phase coherence in equatorial regions, thus affecting how we interpret their dynamics and energy distribution (Buijsman et al. 2017). We investigate the interaction of a baroclinic M2 internal tide wavepacket with an equatorial zonal jet, possibly of any horizontal or vertical structure. The dynamics of the low modes are explored as well as the potential excitation of higher vertical modes and how these interactions can generate incoherences in the baroclinic tide signal. We develop an idealized linear model using modal decomposition (Kelly et al. 2016), which is solved using Dedalus, to study the dynamics of a mode 1 M2 internal wavepacket on an equatorial beta plane. A zonal jet, with a uniform or a sheared vertical structure, is added at the equator to investigate potential wave-mean flow interaction. We find that a vertically uniform zonal jet affects the propagation of the mode 1 wavepacket. Depending on the strength of the jet, this can cause total reflection or strong distortion of the wavepacket. In contrast, a wavepacket entering a vertically sheared jet shows energy scattering into higher modes, which have lower phase and group speeds, shorter wavelengths, and are thus more susceptible to dissipation (and critical layers for non-uniform stratification). As the wavepacket exits the jet, reverse energy transfer occurs and the phase speed difference between the modes may explain part of the phase incoherence observed in altimetry data."

However, existing agents are typically confined to static, predefined action spaces--such as exclusively using APIs, GUI events, or robotic commands.

To bridge this gap, we propose CrossAgent, a unified agentic model that masters heterogeneous action spaces and autonomously selects the most effective interface for each step of a trajectory. We introduce a comprehensive training pipeline that integrates cold-start supervised fine-tuning with a Multi-Turn Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. This approach enables the agent to learn adaptive action switching--balancing high-level efficiency with low-level precision--without human-specified rules. Extensive experiments on over 800 tasks in the open-world Minecraft environment demonstrate that CrossAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance. By dynamically leveraging the strengths of diverse action spaces, our model significantly outperforms fixed-action baselines, exhibiting superior generalization and efficiency in long-horizon reasoning.

The energies and forces are provided by a high-dimensional neural network potential trained to density functional theory data. Water can interact in molecular form as well as dissociatively with the investigated interfaces, and the degree of dissociation is determined primarily by the protonation of SiO$_4$ groups accessible at the surface. A major part of the simultaneously formed hydroxide ions is adsorbed at surface calcium atoms, whose octahedral coordination spheres are completed by additional water molecules. The T3 termination, which is most stable in vacuum, shows only little reactivity in water. For the only slightly less stable T2 termination, however, two distinct types of surface defects are observed. The type I defect is even stable in vacuum and leads to a reconstruction of the entire surface, while the type II defect is only found in the presence of water. Overall, our results suggest that a variety of structures may be formed at the Ca$_2$SiO$_4$(010) surface, which are stabilized in the presence of water."

As RAG expands with table-augmented generation to incorporate structured data, workloads integrating table and vector search are becoming more prevalent. However, efficiently executing such queries remains challenging due to inaccurate cardinality estimation for vector search components, leading to suboptimal query plans. In this paper, we propose Exqutor, an extended query optimizer for vector-augmented analytical queries. Exqutor is a pluggable cardinality estimation framework designed to address this issue, leveraging exact cardinality query optimization techniques to enhance estimation accuracy when vector indexes (e.g., HNSW, IVF) are available. In scenarios lacking these indexes, we employ a sampling-based approach with adaptive sampling size adjustment, dynamically tuning the sample size to balance estimation accuracy and sampling overhead. This allows Exqutor to efficiently approximate vector search cardinalities while minimizing computational costs. We integrate our framework into pgvector, VBASE, and DuckDB, demonstrating performance improvements of up to four orders of magnitude on vector-augmented analytical queries."

    "abstract": "The growing adoption of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies enables automated, real-time collection of manufacturing process data, unlocking new opportunities for data-driven product development. Current data-driven methods are generally applied within specific domains, such as design or manufacturing, with limited exploration of integrating design features and manufacturing process data. Since design decisions significantly affect manufacturing outcomes, such as error rates, energy consumption, and processing times, the lack of such integration restricts the potential for data-driven product design improvements. This paper presents a data-driven approach to mapping and analyzing the relationship between design features and manufacturing process data. A comprehensive system architecture is developed to ensure continuous data collection and integration. The linkage between design features and manufacturing process data serves as the basis for developing a machine learning model that enables automated design improvement suggestions. By integrating manufacturing process data with sustainability metrics, this approach opens new possibilities for sustainable product development."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a simple weak Galerkin (WG) finite element method for the Reissner-Mindlin plate model that partially eliminates the need for traditionally employed stabilizers. The proposed approach accommodates general, including non-convex, polytopal meshes, thereby offering greater geometric flexibility. It utilizes bubble functions without imposing the restrictive conditions required by existing stabilizer-free WG methods, which simplifies implementation and broadens applicability to a wide range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Moreover, the method allows for flexible choices of polynomial degrees in the discretization and can be applied in any spatial dimension. We establish optimal-order error estimates for the WG approximation in a discrete H^1 norm, and present numerical experiments that validate the theoretical results."

    "abstract": "Asymptotic methods for hypothesis testing in high-dimensional data usually require the dimension of the observations to increase to infinity, often with an additional relationship between the dimension (say, $p$) and the sample size (say, $n$). On the other hand, multivariate asymptotic testing methods are valid for fixed dimension only and their implementations typically require the sample size to be large compared to the dimension to yield desirable results. In practical scenarios, it is usually not possible to determine whether the dimension of the data conform to the conditions required for the validity of the high-dimensional asymptotic methods for hypothesis testing, or whether the sample size is large enough compared to the dimension of the data. In this work, we first describe the notion of uniform-over-$p$ convergences and subsequently, develop a uniform-over-dimension central limit theorem. An asymptotic test for the two-sample equality of locations is developed, which now holds uniformly over the dimension of the observations. Using simulated and real data, it is demonstrated that the proposed test exhibits better performance compared to several popular tests in the literature for high-dimensional data as well as the usual scaled two-sample tests for multivariate data, including the Hotelling's $T^2$ test for multivariate Gaussian data."

We modify the standard setup by allowing the target to spontaneously switch between two states, either active or inactive, and investigate the distribution of first hitting times accrued while the target is active. For this setup, we provide closed formulas for the distribution of the first hitting time. Additionally, we can introduce stochastic resetting to the underlying process and, utilizing our results, derive the formulas for the first time the active target is hit by the process under stochastic resetting. Interestingly, we show that resetting in this setup still leaves some memory; the system is no longer Markovian, which prevents a straightforward application of standard techniques. The analytical results are accompanied by computer simulations of Langevin dynamics."

    "abstract": "A black hole's gravitational pull can deflect light rays to an arbitrary degree. As a result, any source fluctuation near the black hole creates multiple lagged images on an observer's screen. For optically thin stochastic emission, these light echoes give rise to correlations of brightness fluctuations across time-dependent images (movies). The correlation pattern disentangles source-specific characteristics from universal features dictated by general relativity. This picture has motivated a proposal to use the two-point image correlation function as a probe of extreme gravitational lensing in upcoming black-hole imaging campaigns. In this work, we test the feasibility of this method by computing the two-point correlation function of brightness fluctuations in a black-hole movie of state-of-the-art realism. The movie is generated by ray tracing a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation, which can then be blurred to any angular resolution. At an effective resolution expected to be achieved by next-generation terrestrial very-long-baseline interferometric arrays, the lensing signatures appear in neither time-averaged images nor light-curve autocorrelations. However, we demonstrate that they are clearly visible in the more fine-grained two-point image correlation function. Our positive findings motivate a more comprehensive investigation into the instrument specifications and inference techniques needed to resolve extreme lensing effects through correlations."

We demonstrate that our model significantly improves agreement with experimental data compared to the existing models, thereby enabling optimization beyond the previously accessible parameter space. Moreover, our model supports non-sinusoidal current-phase relations of the rf-SQUID's Josephson junction, allowing, for the first time, for the modeling of devices based on Josephson tunnel junctions with inhomogeneous tunnel barriers. We show that the effects of such inhomogeneities are qualitatively similar to, yet distinct from, those of the screening parameter, making their inclusion essential for accurate characterization. Incorporating these effects yields great improved agreement with measurements, even at readout power conditions well beyond typical operating parameters."

We present UnReflectAnything, an RGB-only framework that removes highlights from a single image by predicting a highlight map together with a reflection-free diffuse reconstruction. The model uses a frozen vision transformer encoder to extract multi-scale features, a lightweight head to localize specular regions, and a token-level inpainting module that restores corrupted feature patches before producing the final diffuse image. To overcome the lack of paired supervision, we introduce a Virtual Highlight Synthesis pipeline that renders physically plausible specularities using monocular geometry, Fresnel-aware shading, and randomized lighting which enables training on arbitrary RGB images with correct geometric structure. UnReflectAnything generalizes across natural and surgical domains where non-Lambertian surfaces and non-uniform lighting create severe highlights and it achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.

Moralisation allows to view a Bayesian network (a directed model) as a Markov network (an undirected model), whereas triangulation addresses the opposite direction. We present a categorical framework where these transformations are modelled as functors between a category of Bayesian networks and one of Markov networks. The two kinds of network (the objects of these categories) are themselves represented as functors from a `syntax' domain to a `semantics' codomain. Notably, moralisation and triangulation can be defined inductively on such syntax via functor pre-composition. Moreover, while moralisation is fully syntactic, triangulation relies on semantics. This leads to a discussion of the variable elimination algorithm, reinterpreted here as a functor in its own right, that splits the triangulation procedure in two: one purely syntactic, the other purely semantic. This approach introduces a functorial perspective into the theory of probabilistic graphical models, which highlights the distinctions between syntactic and semantic modifications."

    "abstract": "Scaling fault tolerant quantum computers, especially cryogenic systems, to millions of qubits is challenging due to poorly-scaling data processing and power consumption overheads. One key challenge is the design of decoders for real-time quantum error correction (QEC), which demands high data rates for error processing; this is particularly apparent in systems with cryogenic qubits and room temperature (RT) decoders. In response, cryogenic predecoding using lightweight logic has been proposed to handle common, sparse errors in the cryogenic domain. However, prior work only accounts for a subset of error sources present in real-world quantum systems with limited accuracy, often degrading performance below a useful level in practical scenarios. Furthermore, prior reliance on SFQ logic precludes detailed architecture-technology co-optimization. To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces Pinball, a comprehensive design in cryogenic CMOS of a QEC predecoder tailored to realistic, circuit-level noise. By accounting for error generation and propagation through QEC circuits, our design achieves higher predecoding accuracy, outperforming logical error rates (LER) of the current state-of-the-art cryogenic predecoder by nearly six orders of magnitude. Remarkably, despite operating under much stricter power and area constraints, Pinball also reduces LER by 32.58x and 5x, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art RT predecoder and RT ensemble configurations. By increasing cryogenic coverage, we also reduce syndrome bandwidth up to 3780.72x. Through co-design with 4 K-characterized 22 nm FDSOI technology, we achieve a peak power consumption under 0.56 mW. Voltage/frequency scaling and body biasing enable 22.2x lower typical power consumption, yielding up to 67.4x total energy savings. Assuming a 4 K power budget of 1.5 W, our predecoder supports up to 2,668 logical qubits at d=21."

    "abstract": "Physical artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the AI that interacts with the physical world in real time. Similar to multisensory perception, Physical AI makes decisions based on multimodal updates from sensors and devices. Physical AI thus operates with a finite spatial footprint of its sensory tributaries. The multimodal updates traverse heterogeneous and unreliable paths, involving wireless links. Throughput or latency guarantees do not ensure correct decision-making, as misaligned, misordered, or stale inputs still yield wrong inferences. Preserving decision-time coherence hinges on three timing primitives at the network-application interface: (i) simultaneity, a short coincidence window that groups measurements as co-temporal, (ii) causality, path-wise delivery that never lets a consequence precede its precursor, and (iii) usefulness, a validity horizon that drops information too stale to influence the current action. In this work, we focus on usefulness and adopt temporal window of integration (TWI)-Causality: the TWI enforces decision-time usefulness by assuming path-wise causal consistency and cross-path simultaneity are handled upstream. We model end-to-end path delay as the sum of sensing/propagation, computation, and access/transmission latencies, and formulate network design as minimizing the validity horizon under a delivery reliability constraint. In effect, this calibrates delay-reliability budgets for a timing-aware system operating over sensors within a finite spatial footprint. The joint choice of horizon and per-path reliability is cast as a convex optimization problem, solved to global optimality to obtain the minimal horizon and per-path allocation of reliability. This is compared favourably to a benchmark based on uniform-after-threshold allocation. Overall, this study contributes to timing-aware Physical AI in next-generation networks."

    "abstract": "We study the problem of designing procurement auctions for the strategic uncapacitated facility location problem: a company needs to procure a set of facility locations in order to serve its customers and each facility location is owned by a strategic agent. Each owner has a private cost for providing access to their facility (e.g., renting it or selling it to the company) and needs to be compensated accordingly. The goal is to design truthful auctions that decide which facilities the company should procure and how much to pay the corresponding owners, aiming to minimize the total cost, i.e., the monetary cost paid to the owners and the connection cost suffered by the customers (their distance to the nearest facility). We evaluate the performance of these auctions using the \\emph{frugality ratio}. We first analyze the performance of the classic VCG auction in this context and prove that its frugality ratio is exactly $3$. We then leverage the learning-augmented framework and design auctions that are augmented with predictions regarding the owners' private costs. Specifically, we propose a family of learning-augmented auctions that achieve significant payment reductions when the predictions are accurate, leading to much better frugality ratios. At the same time, we demonstrate that these auctions remain robust even if the predictions are arbitrarily inaccurate, and maintain reasonable frugality ratios even under adversarially chosen predictions. We finally provide a family of ``error-tolerant'' auctions that maintain improved frugality ratios even if the predictions are only approximately accurate, and we provide upper bounds on their frugality ratio as a function of the prediction error."

Cioabă, Koolen, Nozaki, and Vermette obtained a general upper bound on $v(k, θ)$ via Nozaki's linear programming bound and determined many values of $v(k,θ)$. The graphs attaining this bound are distance-regular and are called Moore polygons. Damerell and Georgiacodis proved that there are no Moore polygons of diameter $6$ or more. For smaller diameters, there are infinitely many Moore polygons. We complement these results by proving two nonexistence results for Moore polygons with specific parameters. We also determine new values of $v(k,θ)$: $v(4, \\sqrt{2}) = 14$ and $v(5, \\sqrt{2}) = v(5,\\sqrt{5}-1)=16$. The former is achieved by the co-Heawood graph, and the latter by the folded $5$-cube. We verify that any connected $5$-regular graph with second eigenvalue $λ_2$ exceeding $1$ satisfies $λ_2 \\geq \\sqrt{5} - 1$, and that the unique $5$-regular graph attaining equality in this bound has $10$ vertices. We prove a stronger form of a 2015 conjecture of Kolokolnikov related to the second eigenvalue of cubic graphs of given order, and observe that other recent results on the second eigenvalue of regular graphs are consequences of the general upper bound theorem on $v(k,θ)$ mentioned above."

We further find that reasoning \\emph{quality} is critical: high-quality structured CoT from strong generators yields significantly higher accuracy than lightweight alternatives with the same template, whereas naive Zero-Shot CoT can even degrade performance.

However, leveraging real-world imaging data in clinical research environments is still hampered by strict regulatory constraints, fragmented software infrastructure, and the challenges inherent in conducting large-cohort multicentre studies. This leads to projects that rely on ad-hoc toolchains that are hard to reproduce, difficult to scale beyond single institutions and poorly suited for collaboration between clinicians and data scientists. We present Kaapana, a comprehensive open-source platform for medical imaging research that is designed to bridge this gap. Rather than building single-use, site-specific tooling, Kaapana provides a modular, extensible framework that unifies data ingestion, cohort curation, processing workflows and result inspection under a common user interface. By bringing the algorithm to the data, it enables institutions to keep control over their sensitive data while still participating in distributed experimentation and model development. By integrating flexible workflow orchestration with user-facing applications for researchers, Kaapana reduces technical overhead, improves reproducibility and enables conducting large-scale, collaborative, multi-centre imaging studies. We describe the core concepts of the platform and illustrate how they can support diverse use cases, from local prototyping to nation-wide research networks.

While satellites provide many benefits to society, their use comes with challenges, including the growth of space debris, collisions, ground casualty risks, optical and radio-spectrum pollution, and the alteration of Earth's upper atmosphere through rocket emissions and reentry ablation. There is substantial potential for current or planned actions in orbit to cause serious degradation of the orbital environment or lead to catastrophic outcomes, highlighting the urgent need to find better ways to quantify stress on the orbital environment. Here we propose a new metric, the CRASH Clock, that measures such stress in terms of the time it takes for a catastrophic collision to occur if there are no collision avoidance manoeuvres or there is a severe loss in situational awareness. Our calculations show the CRASH Clock is currently 2.8 days, which suggests there is now little time to recover from a wide-spread disruptive event, such as a solar storm. This is in stark contrast to the pre-megaconstellation era: in 2018, the CRASH Clock was 121 days."

Understanding the effects of such topology on dynamical processes is pivotal for advances in social and natural sciences. In this work we consider the dynamics of Kuramoto oscillators on modular networks and propose a simple coarse-graining procedure where modules are replaced by effective single oscillators. The method is inspired by EEG measurements, where very large groups of neurons under each electrode are interpreted as single nodes in a correlation network. We expose the interplay between intra-module and inter-module coupling strengths in keeping the coarse-graining process meaningful and show that its accuracy depends on the degree of intra-module synchronization. We show that, when modules are well synchronized, the phase transition from asynchronous to synchronous motion in networks with 2 and 3 modules is very well described by their respective reduced systems, regardless of the network structure connecting the modules. Application of the method to real networks with small modularity coefficients, on the other hand, reveals that the approximation is not accurate, although it still allows for the computation of the critical coupling and the qualitative behavior of the order parameter if the inter-module coupling is large enough."

    "abstract": "The functional properties of photoactive proteins are governed by the interplay between bright and dark excited states. While the bright states are well-studied, the dark states, which are fundamental to photostability and light harvesting, are notoriously difficult to characterize. Here, we report the direct observation and full characterization of an optically dark, low-lying singlet excited state in the isolated anion of the meta green fluorescent protein (GFP) chromophore. Using a combination of ultrafast time-resolved action-absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy, we have captured the formation of this state in 100 fs and measured its remarkably long lifetime of 94 ps. We unambiguously assign its charge-transfer character and reveal the precise trapping mechanism through high-level ab initio calculations. Our findings uncover a photoprotective mechanism in biomolecular anions where ultrafast internal conversion quenches electron emission, stabilizing long-lived electronic excitation even when the energy exceeds the electron detachment threshold."

    "abstract": "The space-borne gravitational wave detectors such as TianQin offers a new window to test General Relativity by observing the early inspiral phase of stellar-mass binary black holes. A key concern arises if these stellar-mass binary black holes reside in gaseous environments such as active galactic nucleus accretion disks, where environmental effects imprint detectable modulations on the gravita- tional waveform. Using Bayesian inference on simulated signals containing both environmental and dipole deviation, we have assessed the extent to which the presence of environmental effects affects the detectability of dipole radiation. Our results demonstrate that even in the presence of strong environmental coupling, the dipole parameter can be recovered with high precision, and the evidence for dipole radiation remains distinguishable. Crucially, we find that the existence of environmental effects does not fundamentally impede the identification of dipole radiation, provided both effects are simultaneously modelled in the inference process. This study establishes that future tests of modified gravity with space-borne observatories can remain robust even for sources in astrophysical environments."

    "abstract": "In this study, we propose the Quantum Gradient Flow Algorithm (QGFA), a novel quantum algorithm for solving symmetric positive definite (SPD) linear systems based on the variational formulation and time-evolution dynamics. Conventional quantum linear solvers, such as the quantum matrix inverse algorithm (QMIA), focus on approximating the matrix inverse through quantum signal processing (QSP). However, QMIA suffers from a crucial drawback: its computational efficiency deteriorates as the condition number increases. In contrast, classical SPD linear solvers, such as the steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods, are known for their fast convergence, which stems from the variational optimization principle of SPD systems. Inspired by this, we develop QGFA, which obtains the solution vector through the gradient-flow process of the corresponding quadratic energy functional. To validate the proposed method, we apply QGFA to the displacement-based finite element method (FEM) for two-dimensional linear elastic problems under plane stress conditions. The algorithm demonstrates accurate convergence toward classical FEM solutions even with a moderate number of QSP phase factors. Compared with QMIA, QGFA achieves lower relative errors and faster convergence when initialized with suitable initial states, demonstrating its potential as an efficient preconditioned quantum linear solver. The proposed framework provides a physically interpretable connection between classical iterative solvers and quantum computational paradigms. These findings suggest that QGFA can serve as a foundation for future developments in Quantum Computer-Aided Engineering (Quantum CAE), including nonlinear and multiphysics simulations."

We present the first evidence for a non-perturbative 1/g^2 boundary mass generation and its ensuing correction to the standard Casimir energy.

Rather than distilling geometric features solely into the vision encoder, we align the LLM's hidden states corresponding to visual tokens with features from a frozen geometry-aware vision transformer (VGGT), ensuring that geometric understanding is deeply integrated into the multimodal representations that drive action prediction. Pretrained on the Bridge dataset with this geometry distillation mechanism, GLaD achieves 94.1% average success rate across four LIBERO task suites, outperforming UniVLA (92.5%) which uses identical pretraining data. These results validate that geometry-aware pretraining enhances spatial reasoning and policy generalization without requiring explicit depth sensors or 3D annotations."

However, compared to meshes or radiance fields, existing multiview diffusion models offer limited appearance manipulation, particularly in terms of material, texture, or style. In this paper, we present a lightweight adaptation technique for appearance transfer in multiview diffusion models. Our method learns to combine object identity from an input image with appearance cues rendered in a separate reference image, producing multi-view-consistent output that reflects the desired materials, textures, or styles. This allows explicit specification of appearance parameters at generation time while preserving the underlying object geometry and view coherence. We leverage three diffusion denoising processes responsible for generating the original object, the reference, and the target images, and perform reverse sampling to aggregate a small subset of layer-wise self-attention features from the object and the reference to influence the target generation. Our method requires only a few training examples to introduce appearance awareness to pretrained multiview models. The experiments show that our method provides a simple yet effective way toward multiview generation with diverse appearance, advocating the adoption of implicit generative 3D representations in practice."

However, these models typically build on lengthy reasoning chains and large numbers of input visual tokens. Motivated by empirical observations from our benchmark study, we hypothesize that concise reasoning combined with a reduced set of visual tokens can be sufficient for effective video reasoning. To evaluate this hypothesis, we design and validate an efficient post-training and inference framework that enhances a video MLLM's reasoning capability. Our framework enables models to operate on compressed visual tokens and generate brief reasoning traces prior to answering. The resulting models achieve substantially improved inference efficiency, deliver competitive performance across diverse benchmarks, and avoid reliance on manual CoT annotations or supervised fine-tuning. Collectively, our results suggest that long, human-like CoT reasoning may not be necessary for general video reasoning, and that concise reasoning can be both effective and efficient.

    "abstract": "Identifying influential nodes plays a pivotal role in understanding, controlling, and optimizing the behavior of complex systems, ranging from social to biological and technological domains. Yet most centrality-based approaches rely on pairwise topology and are purely structural, neglecting the higher-order interactions and the coupling between structure and dynamics. Consequently, the practical effectiveness of existing approaches remains uncertain when applied to complex spreading processes. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified framework, Initial Propagation Score (IPS), to directly embed propagation dynamics into influence assessment on higher-order networks. We analytically derive mechanism-aware influence measures by relating the early-stage dynamics and local topological characteristics to long-term outbreak sizes, and such explicit physical context endows IPS with robustness, transferability, and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple dynamics and more than 20 real-world hypergraphs show that IPS consistently outperforms other leading baseline centralities. Furthermore, IPS estimates node influence with only local neighborhood information, yielding computational efficiency and scalability to large-scale networks. This work underscores the necessity of considering dynamics for reliable identification of influential nodes and provides a concise principled basis for optimizing interventions in epidemiology, information diffusion, and collective intelligence."

We show that one can express the task of finding LIOMs as an optimization problem. In simple cases, solving this problem amounts to matrix diagonalization, while in more complex settings, it connects to the question of finding classical ground states of spin-glass models. We illustrate our theory using paradigmatic examples of single-particle Anderson localization and MBL in interacting spin chains.

This motivates the study of the finite-time behavior of the solutions to scaled inhomogeneous affine Stochastic Volterra equations through the lens of a weaker notion of stationarity referred to as $\\textit{fake stationary regime}$ in the sense that all marginal distributions share the same expectation and variance. As a first application, we introduce the $\\textit{Fake stationary Volterra Heston model}$ and derive a closed-form expression for its characteristic function. Having established this finite-time proxy for stationarity, we then investigate the asymptotic (long-time) behavior to assess whether genuine stationary regimes emerge in the limit. Using an extension of the exponential-affine transformation formula for those processes, we establish in the long run the existence of limiting distributions, which (unlike in the case of classical affine diffusion processes) may depend on the initial state of the process, unless the Volterra kernel coincides with the $α-$ fractional integration kernel, for which the dependence on the initial state vanishes. We then proceed to the construction of stationary processes associated with these limiting distributions. However, the dynamics in this long-term regime are analytically intractable, and the process itself is not guaranteed to be stationary in the classical sense over finite horizons. This highlights the relevance of finite-time analysis through the lens of the aforementioned $\\textit{fake stationarity}$, which offers a tractable approximation to stationary behavior in genuinely non-stationary Volterra systems."

The signature of a path, defined as the collection of all iterated integrals, provides a complete description of its geometric structure and has emerged as a powerful tool in machine learning and stochastic analysis. Despite growing applications in finance, healthcare, and engineering, the non-asymptotic concentration properties of signature features remain largely unexplored. We prove that level-$k$ signature coordinates exhibit optimal $\\exp(-c t^{2/k})$ tail decay and establish dimension-free concentration inequalities for the full truncated signature vector. Our results reveal a fundamental trade-off: higher truncation levels capture more complex path properties but exhibit heavier tails. For Brownian motion and fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H > 1/4$, we derive explicit variance formulas and sharp constants. The technical contributions combine rough path theory with Gaussian analysis, leveraging Wiener chaos decomposition, hypercontractivity, and the algebraic structure of tensor algebras. We further establish concentration for log-signatures, lead-lag transformations, and provide sample complexity bounds for statistical learning with signature features. This work bridges advanced probability theory with practical applications, offering both theoretical guarantees and computational methods for signature-based approaches in sequential data analysis."

In order for an ice sheet model to generate realistic projections, its parameters must first be calibrated using observational data; this is challenging due to the nonlinearity of the model equations, the high dimensionality of the underlying parameters, and limited data availability for validation. This study leverages the emerging field of neural posterior approximation for efficiently calibrating ice sheet model parameters and boundary conditions. We make use of a one-dimensional (flowline) Shallow-Shelf Approximation model in a state-space framework. A neural network is trained to infer the underlying parameters, namely the bedrock elevation and basal friction coefficient along the flowline, based on observations of ice velocity and ice surface elevation. Samples from the approximate posterior distribution of the parameters are then used within an ensemble Kalman filter to infer latent model states, namely the ice thickness along the flowline. We show through a simulation study that our approach yields more accurate estimates of the parameters and states than a state-augmented ensemble Kalman filter, which is the current state-of-the-art. We apply our approach to infer the bed elevation and basal friction along a flowline in Thwaites Glacier, Antarctica."

On the Earth, this escape is limited by transport though the tropospheric cold trap where water vapour condenses. However, on a tidally-locked exoplanet, the strong day-night temperature gradient drives a global-scale circulation. This circulation could rapidly transport water through the cold trap, potentially increasing hydrogen escape and impacting the composition of potentially habitable worlds. We couple cometary impact and planetary atmospheric models to simulate water-depositing impacts with both a tidally-locked and Earth-analogue atmosphere and quantify how atmospheric circulations transport water from the impact site to high altitudes where it can potentially drive escape. The global nature of the atmospheric circulations on a tidally-locked world enhances hydrogen escape, with both our unimpacted tidally-locked and Earth-analogue atmospheres exhibiting similar mass loss rates despite the tidally-locked atmosphere being bpth cooler and drier near the surface. When considering the effects of a cometary impact, we find an order of magnitude difference in peak escape rates between impacts on the day-side ($Φ_{\\mathrm{escape}}=1.33\\times10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,mth^{-1}}$) and night-side ($Φ_{\\mathrm{escape}}=1.51\\times10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,mth^{-1}}$) of a tidally-locked atmosphere, with the latter being of the same order of magnitude as the peak escape rate found for an impact with an Earth-analogue atmosphere ($Φ_{\\mathrm{escape}}=2.7\\times10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,mth^{-1}}$).

The measured spectral changes--including the redistribution of Zhang-Rice-related spectral weigh--are in qualitative agreement with determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the three-orbital Emery model, which together indicate a pronounced reconstruction of the electronic structure beyond hole concentrations x>0.2. Guided by these observations, we propose a spontaneous checkerboard-type Zhang-Rice electronic configuration that captures the coexistence of itinerant and localized carriers characteristic of the heavily overdoped state.

The result is compared with that of the ΛCDM model indicating that in addition to providing a viable dynamical dark energy framework, predictions for H(z) are slightly more consistent with intermediate-redshift observations. Generally, the model remains compatible with current data and offers testable deviations from ΛCDM for upcoming surveys. It is also seen that when the energy density of quantum fields in vacuum, exposed by NTHDE, is combined with the Rastall correction term to the general relativity, a plausible candidate for dynamical dark energy is obtained that mimic the current value of the dark energy density parameter reported in the ΛCDM model. The latter cannot be repeated by NTHDE alone. The study also confirms previous theoretical and observational constraints on the Rastall parameter obtained by focusing on the thermodynamics, early universe, pulsars, and the early-type galaxies."

    "abstract": "This work presents a pilot study on a strained complex concentrated alloy based on refractory elements: MoNbTaTiZr. Initially, the as-cast and homogenization-annealed conditions were characterized. After casting, the alloy consists of two solid solutions with BCC 1 and BCC 2 crystal structures. Homogenization annealing promotes the growth, ordering, and refinement of the BCC 2 phase. TEM and AES analyses indicate possible Zr segregation at grain boundaries in the as-cast state. In contrast, annealing followed by cooling results in the formation of Ti-Zr-based particles without segregation. Subsequently, the annealed alloy was cold-rolled, and its microstructure was investigated. During rolling, grain fragmentation occurs within the structure. In addition to the two BCC solid solutions, a phase with an FCC crystal structure is identified after rolling. Its composition corresponds to the Zr2Ta phase, which is a Laves phase of the A2B type. Rotational relationships, relatively rare in rolled materials with BCC structures, are identified. The texture components found after 10% rolling deformation are related to that present after 20% deformation by a 45 degrees <110> rotation, and this component is related to that appearing after 30% deformation by a 20 degrees <100> rotation. However, no distinct rolling texture or clear texture development was observed, although some mutual relationships among preferred orientations can be identified. Schmid and Taylor factor maps demonstrate that, despite deformation, the alloy remains capable of further strain accumulation and plastic deformation. Twinning is also observed after rolling, which may be beneficial, as deformation twinning contributes to improved ductility in the alloy."

    "abstract": "We analyze interactions between turbulent airfoil wake and an extremely strong gust using a data-driven framework with time-dependent bases. The current approach represents each snapshot with time-varying bases consisting of two-dimensional in-plane modes and one-dimensional spanwise modes, together with a reduced covariance matrix. We derive closed-form evolution equations for these time-varying components and advance them over time, requiring only a small rolling window and avoiding full-history storage. Applied to extreme vortex gust-airfoil interaction at Re=5000, we examine how in-plane modes and their associated energy level evolve across gust conditions of varying intensity and size. Before impingement, the first in-plane mode dominates; after impingement, the second mode gains energy_amplified by stronger/larger gusts. A larger leading-mode energy gap implies coherent structure and faster recovery; a smaller gap with slower decay indicates richer multiscale activity and delayed re-stabilization. These trends follow the transient lift dynamics as well, with higher amplitude and more oscillations indicated by a rise in the leading singular values. This work provides an interpretable, time-varying data-driven modal analysis of extreme gust encounter."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in generative machine learning have opened new possibilities for the discovery and design of novel materials. However, as these models become more sophisticated, the need for rigorous and meaningful evaluation metrics has grown. Existing evaluation approaches often fail to capture both the quality and novelty of generated structures, limiting our ability to assess true generative performance. In this paper, we introduce the Transport Novelty Distance (TNovD) to judge generative models used for materials discovery jointly by the quality and novelty of the generated materials. Based on ideas from Optimal Transport theory, TNovD uses a coupling between the features of the training and generated sets, which is refined into a quality and memorization regime by a threshold. The features are generated from crystal structures using a graph neural network that is trained to distinguish between materials, their augmented counterparts, and differently sized supercells using contrastive learning. We evaluate our proposed metric on typical toy experiments relevant for crystal structure prediction, including memorization, noise injection and lattice deformations. Additionally, we validate the TNovD on the MP20 validation set and the WBM substitution dataset, demonstrating that it is capable of detecting both memorized and low-quality material data. We also benchmark the performance of several popular material generative models. While introduced for materials, our TNovD framework is domain-agnostic and can be adapted for other areas, such as images and molecules."

Using colorectal cancer as a case study, we evaluate CanAnswer through a lab study with 24 participants and interviews with six medical experts. Results show that CanAnswer improves the recalled gained knowledge and reduces the task workload of the learning session. Our expert interviews (N=6) further confirm the reliability and usefulness of CanAnswer.

    "abstract": "We consider the Effective Field Theory (EFT) proposed by Hongo and Son to describe two-neutron halo nuclei where the neutron-core interaction is subleading. In this EFT, the ratio of the mean-square matter radius and charge radius is universal in so far that it only depends on the two-neutron separation energy of the nucleus and the neutron-neutron scattering length. By investigating the divergence structure of this theory, we find that one further renormalization condition is required to predict both radii separately. Our renormalization scheme uses one of the mean square radii or the scattering amplitude as input. We use Hongo and Son's theory to calculate the matter radii of the two-neutron halo nuclei $^{11}$Li, $^{14}$Be, $^{17}$B, $^{19}$B, and $^{22}$C and compare to the values obtained with standard Halo EFT. In this comparison we use both the physical value of the neutron-core scattering length and rescaled values. We observe good convergence against Hongo and Son's results for the case of a negligible neutron-core interaction. Similar agreement for the radii is also found in the case of the halo nucleus $^6$He, where the $nc$ interaction is in the p-wave. Our renormalization scheme makes the restriction in the ultraviolet cutoff range from the Landau pole explicit. We calculate the position of the Landau pole for various halo nuclei. In all cases the Landau pole restricts the cutoff to rather low values. Finally, we derive an explicit expression for the three-to-three neutron-neutron-core scattering amplitude and discuss its cut structure."

    "abstract": "Phase separation in confined environments is a fundamental process underlying geological flows, porous filtration, emulsions, and intracellular organization. Yet, how confinement and activity jointly govern coarsening kinetics and interfacial morphology remains poorly understood. Here, we use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate vapor-liquid phase separation of passive and active fluids embedded in complex porous media. By generating porous host structures via a freeze-quench protocol, we systematically control the average pore size and demonstrate that confinement induces a crossover from the Lifshitz-Slyozov power-law growth to logarithmically slowed coarsening, ultimately arresting domain evolution. Analysis of correlation functions and structure factors reveals that confined passive systems exhibit fractal interfaces, violating Porod's law and indicating rough morphological arrest. In contrast, introducing self-propulsion dramatically changes the coarsening pathway: activity restores smooth interfaces, breaks the confinement-induced scaling laws, and drives a transition from logarithmic to ballistic domain growth at high activity levels. Our findings reveal an activity-controlled mechanism to overcome geometric restrictions and unlock coarsening in structurally heterogeneous environments. These insights establish a unifying framework for nonequilibrium phase transitions in porous settings, with broad relevance to active colloids, catalytic media, and biologically crowded systems, where living matter routinely reorganizes within geometric constraints to sustain function."

    "abstract": "Aerial object detection faces significant challenges in real-world scenarios, such as small objects and extensive background interference, which limit the performance of RGB-based detectors with insufficient discriminative information. Multispectral images (MSIs) capture additional spectral cues across multiple bands, offering a promising alternative. However, the lack of training data has been the primary bottleneck to exploiting the potential of MSIs. To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale dataset for Multispectral Object Detection in Aerial images (MODA), which comprises 14,041 MSIs and 330,191 annotations across diverse, challenging scenarios, providing a comprehensive data foundation for this field. Furthermore, to overcome challenges inherent to aerial object detection using MSIs, we propose OSSDet, a framework that integrates spectral and spatial information with object-aware cues. OSSDet employs a cascaded spectral-spatial modulation structure to optimize target perception, aggregates spectrally related features by exploiting spectral similarities to reinforce intra-object correlations, and suppresses irrelevant background via object-aware masking. Moreover, cross-spectral attention further refines object-related representations under explicit object-aware guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OSSDet outperforms existing methods with comparable parameters and efficiency."

Existence and uniqueness of the ground states of the unitary Fermi gases are studied with/without the angular momentum rotation term. We present a regularized normalized gradient flow method to compute the ground states of trapped unitary Fermi gases. Our numerical results show that the quantum pressure term has a significant effect on the ground state properties. Specifically, with the presence of the quantum pressure term, the vortex lattices are very different from those obtained in conventional Bose-Einstein condensation."

The feature of this game is that the control cost of a follower in the cost functionals of both players is small, which means that the game under consideration is a cheap control game. The open-loop solution of this game is studied. Using the game's solvability conditions, obtaining such a game's solution is reduced to the solution of a proper boundary-value problem. Due to the smallness of the follower's control cost, this boundary-value problem is singularly perturbed. The asymptotic behaviour of the solution to this problem is analysed. Based on this analysis, the asymptotic behaviour of the open-loop optimal players' controls and the optimal values of the cost functionals is studied. Using these results, asymptotically suboptimal players' controls are designed. An illustrative example of a supply chain problem with a small control cost of a retailer is presented."

Existing Vision Transformer(ViT)-based time-series reconstruction methods, like SMTS-ViT, often employ coarse temporal embeddings that aggregate entire sequences, causing substantial information loss and reducing reconstruction accuracy. To address these limitations, a Video Vision Transformer (ViViT)-based framework with temporal-spatial fusion embedding for MSI reconstruction in cloud-covered regions is proposed in this study. Non-overlapping tubelets are extracted via 3D convolution with constrained temporal span $(t=2)$, ensuring local temporal coherence while reducing cross-day information degradation. Both MSI-only and SAR-MSI fusion scenarios are considered during the experiments. Comprehensive experiments on 2020 Traill County data demonstrate notable performance improvements: MTS-ViViT achieves a 2.23\\% reduction in MSE compared to the MTS-ViT baseline, while SMTS-ViViT achieves a 10.33\\% improvement with SAR integration over the SMTS-ViT baseline. The proposed framework effectively enhances spectral reconstruction quality for robust agricultural monitoring."

    "abstract": "Natural hydrogen generated by water-rock interaction in ultramafic rocks is increasingly recognised as a potentially important primary energy resource, but the pore-scale processes that control the initiation and early transport of a free gas phase remain poorly constrained. Here we present an in situ X-ray micro-tomography experiment in which an ultramafic granular pack of dunnite from West Papua, Indonesia, saturated with KI-doped brine, is heated to 100C with a pore pressure of 4bar under 10bar confining pressure inside a micro-CT scanner. Time-resolved 4D imaging captures the transition from a fully liquid-saturated pore space to the appearance and growth of a distinct gas phase after an 8h induction period. Bubbles first nucleate near the top of the sample before becoming distributed throughout the imaged volume as a connected ganglia. The nucleating gas phase is most plausibly dominated by molecular hydrogen generated by low-temperature fluid-rock reaction, as indicated by independent hydrogen-presence detectors, although we cannot yet fully exclude minor contributions from other gases. SEM-BEX imaging reveals textural alteration and local changes in elemental signals between reacted and unreacted material. Taken together, these observations provide spatially and temporally resolved evidence for gas generation during low-temperature alteration of ultramafic grains and demonstrate that pore-scale imaging can directly link water-rock reaction kinetics, gas generation and multiphase flow behaviour in natural hydrogen systems."

    "abstract": "There are many ways to represent the syntax of a language with binders. In particular, nominal frameworks are metalanguages that feature (among others) name abstraction types, which can be used to specify the type of binders. The resulting syntax representation (nominal data types) makes alpha-equivalent terms equal, and features a name-invariant induction principle. It is known that name abstraction types can be presented either as existential or universal quantification on names. On the one hand, nominal frameworks use the existential presentation for practical reasoning since the user is allowed to match on a name-term pattern where the name is bound in the term. However inference rules for existential name abstraction are cumbersome to specify/implement because they must keep track of information about free and bound names at the type level. On the other hand, universal name abstractions are easier to specify since they are treated not as pairs, but as functions consuming fresh names. Yet the ability to pattern match on such functions is seemingly lost. In this work we show that this ability and others are recovered in a type theory consisting of (1) nullary ($0$-ary) internally parametric type theory (nullary PTT) (2) a type of names and a novel name induction principle (3) nominal data types. This extension of nullary PTT can act as a legitimate nominal framework. Indeed it has universal name abstractions, nominal pattern matching, a freshness type former, name swapping and local-scope operations and (non primitive) existential name abstractions. We illustrate how term-relevant nullary parametricity is used to recover nominal pattern matching. Our main example involves synthetic Kripke parametricity."

A spectral analysis shows that the CSIT preserves phase while suppressing high-wavenumber noise, offering advantages over conventional Fourier derivatives. We discuss the roles of the real and imaginary step parameters, compare FFT-based and interpolation-based implementations, and demonstrate the method on the advection equation and instantaneous-frequency computation. Results show that the CSIT yields smoother, more robust attributes than Hilbert-based methods and provides built-in stabilization for PDE solvers. The CSIT thus represents a flexible alternative for numerical differentiation, spectral analysis, and seismic signal processing. The method opens several avenues for future work, including non-periodic implementations, adaptive parameter selection, and integration with local interpolation frameworks such as high-order Finite-Element methods."

WSM NP with inherent nonreciprocity has a radiative heat flux 27 times higher than NP with degenerate modes. The underlying physics is elucidated by the coupling and decoupling of the electromagnetic local density of states between nonreciprocal WSN NP and the plate in the near-field.

    "abstract": "Recent vision language models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated impressive anomaly detection performance under significant distribution shift by utilizing high-level semantic information through text prompts. However, these models often neglect fine-grained details, such as which kind of anomalies, like \"hole\", \"cut\", \"scratch\" that could provide more specific insight into the nature of anomalies. We argue that recognizing fine-grained anomaly types 1) enriches the representation of \"abnormal\" with structured semantics, narrowing the gap between coarse anomaly signals and fine-grained defect categories; 2) enables manufacturers to understand the root causes of the anomaly and implement more targeted and appropriate corrective measures quickly. While incorporating such detailed semantic information is crucial, designing handcrafted prompts for each defect type is both time-consuming and susceptible to human bias. For this reason, we introduce DAPO, a novel approach for Defect-aware Prompt Optimization based on progressive tuning for the zero-shot multi-type and binary anomaly detection and segmentation under distribution shifts. Our approach aligns anomaly-relevant image features with their corresponding text semantics by learning hybrid defect-aware prompts with both fixed textual anchors and learnable token embeddings. We conducted experiments on public benchmarks (MPDD, VisA, MVTec-AD, MAD, and Real-IAD) and an internal dataset. The results suggest that compared to the baseline models, DAPO achieves a 3.7% average improvement in AUROC and average precision metrics at the image level under distribution shift, and a 6.5% average improvement in localizing novel anomaly types under zero-shot settings."

This work demonstrates that the physically motivated decaying term $|x|^{-α}$ breaks the scaling symmetry inherent in the autonomous case. Such breaking energetically separates the exterior domain problem from the whole space one and thereby prevents energy leakage. Using a novel min-max argument that combines monotonicity trick, Morse index estimates, and blow-up analysis, we prove the existence of a positive mountain pass solution for sufficiently small mass, revealing a new phenomenon of non-autonomous nonlinearities in non-compact domains."

Motivated by this potential, we investigate the issue of joint localization and channel estimation for the uplink PASS in the presence of multipath dispersion. To this end, a comprehensive multi-user orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) uplink PASS model is first established, where the use of a cyclic prefix (CP) enables the multipath-induced time-domain dispersion to be transformed into a set of superimposed sinusoids in the frequency domain. Building upon this model, we propose a hybrid inference framework capable of accurately estimating both channel parameters and user locations. Specifically, expectation propagation is first employed to mitigate multi-user interference, while the path delays are then extracted from noisy channel state information using an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) based approach, or a hybrid belief propagation-variational inference (BP-VI) algorithm. Then the estimated delays are subsequently refined through the embedded geometric information via an iterative localization procedure, wherein the estimated channel matrices are recursively fed back to EP. Furthermore, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to characterize the fundamental estimation limits. Finally, simulation results validate that our proposed framework closely approaches the CRLB, with performance comparable to cooperative multi-base station localization, with significantly fewer RF chains and reduced hardware complexity."

    "abstract": "Video unified models exhibit strong capabilities in understanding and generation, yet they struggle with reason-informed visual editing even when equipped with powerful internal vision-language models (VLMs). We attribute this gap to two factors: 1) existing datasets are inadequate for training and evaluating reasoning-aware video editing, and 2) an inherent disconnect between the models' reasoning and editing capabilities, which prevents the rich understanding from effectively instructing the editing process. Bridging this gap requires an integrated framework that connects reasoning with visual transformation. To address this gap, we introduce the Reason-Informed Video Editing (RVE) task, which requires reasoning about physical plausibility and causal dynamics during editing. To support systematic evaluation, we construct RVE-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with two complementary subsets: Reasoning-Informed Video Editing and In-Context Video Generation. These subsets cover diverse reasoning dimensions and real-world editing scenarios. Building upon this foundation, we propose the ReViSE, a Self-Reflective Reasoning (SRF) framework that unifies generation and evaluation within a single architecture. The model's internal VLM provides intrinsic feedback by assessing whether the edited video logically satisfies the given instruction. The differential feedback that refines the generator's reasoning behavior during training. Extensive experiments on RVE-Bench demonstrate that ReViSE significantly enhances editing accuracy and visual fidelity, achieving a 32% improvement of the Overall score in the reasoning-informed video editing subset over state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "In order to reach the required performance of Stage-III and IV weak lensing surveys, cosmic shear measurements have to rely on external simulations to calibrate residual biases. Over the years, several techniques have been developed to mitigate the impact of residual biases prior to calibration, including the inference of shear responses on images to correct multiplicative biases, and the empirical correction of additive biases. We introduce a novel methodology that generalises upon the state-of-the-art approaches by inferring multiplicative and additive biases jointly from parameterised distributions of measured ellipticities, crucially without relying on external simulations and independently from cosmology. Shear biases are marginalised over the unknown hyper-parameters in the modelling, hence mitigating the impact of degeneracies. We apply the technique to a representative problem and show the performance of the estimation, even in the presence of noise. The method has a high potential for applicability to the calibration of weak lensing cosmic shear in current and future lensing surveys."

Conventionally, the shapes of absorption lines are modeled by convolving thermal profiles (computed given some model stellar atmosphere and line list) with broadening kernels intended to account for the effects of rotation and other nonthermal sources of broadening (i.e., macroturbulence). Here, we show that the assumptions that permit this convolution can break down at high spectral resolution and produce appreciable errors in the modeled flux. We then consider the effects of rotation, microturbulence, and macroturbulence on the intensity and flux contribution functions, which astronomers use to map individual spectral segments to quasi-physical formation ``locations'' in the stellar atmosphere. We show that proper consideration of 1) the distinction between intensity and flux and 2) the inclusion of rotation and macroturbulence in the contribution function can dramatically change the modeled formation temperatures. To complement this analysis, we provide a package -- FormationTemperatures.jl -- which quickly computes model line contribution functions and formation parameters given bulk stellar properties as input. In closing, we emphasize the assumptions inherent to this analysis, consider in which regimes the convolution expression for flux should be avoided, and caution how the concept of a singular ``formation temperature'' can oversimplify some realities of radiative transfer."

    "abstract": "Photonic integrated Brillouin lasers have emerged as an important tool to realize a wide range of precision applications, including atomic time-keeping, low-noise microwave signal generation, fiber and quantum sensing, and ultra-high capacity coherent communications. While Brillouin lasers routinely achieve sub-Hz instantaneous linewidths, many of these applications also require exceptional frequency stability and high-power single-mode emission. A recent demonstration showed that extending the resonator length increases the laser power while also improving the frequency stability through suppression of thermorefractive noise. However, as the resonator scales to larger lengths, multiple optical resonances can be found within the Brillouin gain bandwidth, greatly complicating the laser dynamics compared to existing coupled-mode Brillouin laser models. Given the potential to scale lasers of this type to watt-level output powers at sub-mHz linewidths, a theoretical model describing this physics is needed to provide key insights into their performance. Here, we develop a coupled-mode theory of integrated large mode volume Brillouin lasers, accounting for multiple cavity modes with potential to lase within the gain bandwidth. We obtain expressions for the steady-state dynamics, spontaneous spectrum, relative intensity noise, and frequency noise. Our analysis reveals that the broad gain bandwidth results in atypical Brillouin dynamics, giving rise to distinct features in the noise spectra, and consequently modifications of the standard, single-mode fundamental linewidth of Brillouin lasers. Additionally, these features may be used for a variety of tangential applications, such as phonon spectroscopy or quality factor enhancement. Furthermore, we find that the linewidth can be significantly impacted by transferred RIN from the external pump in Brillouin lasers that lack ideal phase matching."

We adapt two off-the-shelf models as baselines for online struggle detection and anticipation. Online struggle detection achieves 70-80% per-frame mAP, while struggle anticipation up to 2 seconds ahead yields comparable performance with slight drops. We further examine generalization across tasks and activities and analyse the impact of skill evolution. Despite larger domain gaps in activity-level generalization, models still outperform random baselines by 4-20%.

Using EEH geometry, we compute the structure of circular motion, the effective potential and force, and we evaluate the orbital, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies together with the Lense-Thirring and periastron precession rates. Our calculations show that, compared to the Kerr model, the charge parameter $Q$ and the spin parameter $a$ significantly modify the strong gravitational field and shift the characteristic frequencies. We then model the dynamical structure formed by matter accreting toward the EEH black hole through the BHL mechanism, finding that the parameter $Q$ increases the amount of infalling matter and strengthens shock-cone instabilities near the horizon, while farther from the black hole it suppresses accretion and reduces turbulence. Time-series analysis of the accretion rate reveals robust QPOs, whose low-frequency components arise from the precession of the shock cone, while high-frequency components appear as a consequence of strong-field instabilities modified by $Q$ and $a$. A systematic parameter-space exploration identifies the regions where EEH corrections maximize QPO activity, indicating that nonlinear electrodynamics can leave observable imprints on accretion flows and may be testable with QPO and horizon-scale observations."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "The Great Oxidation Event (GOE) was a $200$ Myr transition circa 2.4 billion years ago that converted the Earth's anoxic atmosphere to one where molecular oxygen (O$_2$) was abundant (volume mixing ratio $>10^{-4}$). This significant rise in O$_2$ is thought to have substantially throttled hydrogen (H) escape and the associated water (H$_2$O) loss. Atmospheric estimations from the GOE onward place O$_2$ concentrations ranging between 0.1\\% to 150\\% PAL, where PAL is the present atmospheric level of 21% by volume. In this study we use WACCM6, a three-dimensional Earth System Model to simulate Earth's atmosphere and predict the diffusion-limited escape rate of hydrogen due to varying O$_2$ post-GOE. We find that O$_2$ indirectly acts as a control valve on the amount of hydrogen atoms reaching the homopause in the simulations: less O$_2$ leads to decreased O$_3$ densities, reducing local tropical tropopause temperatures by up to 18 K, which increases H$_2$O freeze-drying and thus reduces the primary source of hydrogen in the considered scenarios. The maximum differences between all simulations in the total H mixing ratio at the homopause and the associated diffusion-limited escape rates are a factor of 3.2 and 4.7, respectively. The prescribed CH$_4$ mixing ratio (0.8 ppmv) sets a minimum diffusion escape rate of $\\approx 2 \\times 10^{10}$ mol H yr$^{-1}$, effectively a negligible rate when compared to pre-GOE estimates ($\\sim 10^{12}-10^{13}$ mol H y$^{-1}$). Because the changes in our predicted escape rates are comparatively minor, our numerical predictions support geological evidence that the majority of Earth's hydrogen escape occurred prior to the GOE. Our work demonstrates that estimations of how the hydrogen escape rate evolved through Earth's history requires 3D chemistry-climate models which include a global treatment of water vapour microphysics."

Pre-irradiation, the n-type InAs absorbing region exhibits a steadily increasing minority carrier lifetime with increasing temperature, providing evidence that excited minority carriers may be recombining via shallow defect levels. From deep-level transient spectroscopy, two features are found between 10 K and 275 K: a low temperature broad shoulder, which suggests emission from multiple shallow electron defect levels with energies < 29 meV, and a high temperature minimum occurring at approximately 230 K with an activation energy of 539 meV, which suggests a defect in the barrier layer in the device. Two similar nBn detectors are then subjected to 63 MeV proton irradiation in step doses and measured between steps. One experiment is performed in-situ with an nBn held at approximately 10 K during dosing, and the other experiment is performed ex-situ with a similar nBn held at room temperature for dosing. The ex-situ dosing results in an evaluation of the defect introduction rate that is 3-4x lower than in-situ due to partial annealing of the proton-induced displacement damage at room temperature. The results for these two experiments are then compared with the dose-dependent recombination rate analysis, resulting in an estimated recombination defect cross-section of 1.6x10^(-14) cm^2 for the shallow shoulder defect."

We develop a transformer model capable of transpiling quantum circuits from the qasm standard to other sets of gates native suited for a specific target quantum hardware, in our case the set for the trapped-ion quantum computers of IonQ. The feasibility of a translation up to five qubits is demonstrated with a percentage of correctly transpiled target circuits equal or superior to 99.98%. Regardless the depth of the register and the number of gates applied, we prove that the complexity of the transformer model scales, in the worst case scenario, with a polynomial trend by increasing the depth of the register and the length of the circuit, allowing models with a higher number of parameters to be efficiently trained on HPC infrastructures."

Each agent is represented by a personalized value space, a vector space encoding the internal dimensions through which the agent interprets and evaluates meaning. Beliefs are formalized as structured vectors-abstract beings-whose transmission is mediated by linear interpretation maps. A belief survives communication only if it avoids the null spaces of these maps, yielding a structural criterion for intelligibility, miscommunication, and belief death. Within this framework, I show how belief distortion, motivational drift, counterfactual evaluation, and the limits of mutual understanding arise from purely algebraic constraints. A central result-\"the No-Null-Space Leadership Condition\"-characterizes leadership as a property of representational reachability rather than persuasion or authority. More broadly, the model explains how abstract beings can propagate, mutate, or disappear as they traverse diverse cognitive geometries. The account unifies insights from conceptual spaces, social epistemology, and AI value alignment by grounding meaning preservation in structural compatibility rather than shared information or rationality. I argue that this cognitive-geometric perspective clarifies the epistemic boundaries of influence in both human and artificial systems, and offers a general foundation for analyzing belief dynamics across heterogeneous agents."

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of the frequency response of quantum dots under electromagnetic radiation is essential for investigating absorption spectra, excitonic effects, and nonlinear optical behavior in quantum dots and semiconductor nanoparticles. The polarization propagator provides a rigorous framework for evaluating these properties, but its construction is computationally demanding. Challenges arise from the level of electron correlation, the size of the excitonic basis, and the cost of evaluating two-electron integrals. This work addresses these difficulties by developing first- and second-order frequency-dependent polarization propagator calculations for PbS and CdS quantum dots. The propagator is formulated using the electron propagator approach and expressed as the resolvent of the Hamiltonian superoperator. Light-matter interaction is treated using the dipole approximation and represented in a particle-hole excitation operator basis. The correlated ground state is treated at the MP2 level, and all response-matrix terms up to second order in the fluctuating potential are included. A frequency-dependent inverse Krylov subspace method is derived and combined with the folded-spectrum technique to isolate excitation energies within a chosen frequency window. This strategy avoids full diagonalization of the response matrix and significantly reduces computational cost for large systems. The method is implemented in a matrix-free manner in which no explicit response matrix is assembled, and all operations rely on matrix-vector products. UV-VIS excitation spectra of PbS and CdS quantum dots were computed, demonstrating that the inverse Krylov subspace projection approach provides an efficient and accurate approximation for excitation spectra when full diagonalization is computationally prohibitive."

This paper introduces a novel approach for quantifying and comprehending hallucination artifacts to ensure trustworthy computer vision models. Our method, termed the Conformal Hallucination Estimation Metric (CHEM), is applicable to any image reconstruction model, enabling efficient identification and quantification of hallucination artifacts. It offers two key advantages: it leverages wavelet and shearlet representations to efficiently extract hallucinations of image features and uses conformalized quantile regression to assess hallucination levels in a distribution-free manner. Furthermore, from an approximation theoretical perspective, we explore the reasons why U-shaped networks are prone to hallucinations. We test the proposed approach on the CANDELS astronomical image dataset with models such as U-Net, SwinUNet, and Learnlets, and provide new perspectives on hallucination from different aspects in deep learning-based image processing."

    "abstract": "This paper presents OnCoCo 1.0, a new public dataset for fine-grained message classification in online counseling. It is based on a new, integrative system of categories, designed to improve the automated analysis of psychosocial online counseling conversations. Existing category systems, predominantly based on Motivational Interviewing (MI), are limited by their narrow focus and dependence on datasets derived mainly from face-to-face counseling. This limits the detailed examination of textual counseling conversations. In response, we developed a comprehensive new coding scheme that differentiates between 38 types of counselor and 28 types of client utterances, and created a labeled dataset consisting of about 2.800 messages from counseling conversations. We fine-tuned several models on our dataset to demonstrate its applicability. The data and models are publicly available to researchers and practitioners. Thus, our work contributes a new type of fine-grained conversational resource to the language resources community, extending existing datasets for social and mental-health dialogue analysis."

    "abstract": "Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) has garnered significant attention as a promising technology for next-generation wireless and vehicular communications. Among candidate waveforms, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has been extensively investigated over the past decade for its robustness against frequency-selective fading and its favorable ranging performance. However, the waveform's sensing and communication (S&C) performance depends strongly on the modulation scheme; while variable-amplitude constellations such as quadrature amplitude (QAM) are more efficient for communication, constant-modulus modulations such as phase shift keying (PSK) are more suitable for sensing. Yet, it remains unclear whether these findings persist under power amplifier (PA) nonlinearity. Because OFDM signals exhibit a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), they require highly linear PAs to avoid distortion, which conflicts with radar requirements, where high transmit power is always beneficial for sensing. In this work, we analyze the effect of PA-induced distortions on the sensing task for PSK and QAM constellations. By introducing the Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR), we examine the extent of the distortion limitation on the ranging task. We complement simulation results with a theoretical characterization of the ambiguity function (AF), thereby explicitly demonstrating how distortion artifacts manifest in the zero-Doppler sidelobes (i.e, ranging sidelobes) and the zero-delay sidelobes. Simulations show that PA distortions impose a palpable performance ceiling for both constellations, reshape the AF, and reduce detection probability, diminishing the theoretical advantage of unimodular signaling and further compromising the OFDM sensing performance with non-uniform envelope signals."

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has become a promising direction for medical image segmentation, enabling models to learn from limited labeled data alongside abundant unlabeled samples. However, existing SSL approaches for multi-modal medical imaging often struggle to exploit the complementary information between modalities due to semantic discrepancies and misalignment across MRI sequences. To address this, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-modal framework that explicitly enhances modality-specific representations and facilitates adaptive cross-modal information fusion. Specifically, we introduce a Modality-specific Enhancing Module (MEM) to strengthen semantic cues unique to each modality via channel-wise attention, and a learnable Complementary Information Fusion (CIF) module to adaptively exchange complementary knowledge between modalities. The overall framework is optimized using a hybrid objective combining supervised segmentation loss and cross-modal consistency regularization on unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2019 (HGG subset) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong semi-supervised and multi-modal baselines under 1\\%, 5\\%, and 10\\% labeled data settings, achieving significant improvements in both Dice and Sensitivity scores. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary effects of our proposed MEM and CIF in bridging cross-modality discrepancies and improving segmentation robustness under scarce supervision."

    "abstract": "Estimating the 6-degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) pose of a spacecraft from a single image is critical for autonomous operations like in-orbit servicing and space debris removal. Existing state-of-the-art methods often rely on iterative Perspective-n-Point (PnP)-based algorithms, which are computationally intensive and ill-suited for real-time deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To overcome these limitations, we propose FastPose-ViT, a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture that directly regresses the 6DoF pose. Our approach processes cropped images from object bounding boxes and introduces a novel mathematical formalism to map these localized predictions back to the full-image scale. This formalism is derived from the principles of projective geometry and the concept of \"apparent rotation\", where the model predicts an apparent rotation matrix that is then corrected to find the true orientation. We demonstrate that our method outperforms other non-PnP strategies and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art PnP-based techniques on the SPEED dataset. Furthermore, we validate our model's suitability for real-world space missions by quantizing it and deploying it on power-constrained edge hardware. On the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, our end-to-end pipeline achieves a latency of ~75 ms per frame under sequential execution, and a non-blocking throughput of up to 33 FPS when stages are scheduled concurrently."

    "abstract": "Water and land surfaces on a planet interact with gases in the atmosphere and with radiation from the star. These interactions define the environments that prevail on the planet, some of which may be more amenable to prebiotic chemistry, some to the evolution of more complex life. This review article covers (i) the physical conditions that determine the ratio of land to sea on a rocky planet, (ii) how this ratio would affect climatic and biologic processes, and (iii) whether future astronomical observations might constrain this ratio on exoplanets. Water can be delivered in multiple ways to a growing rocky planet -- and although we may not agree on the contribution of different mechanism(s) to Earth's bulk water, hydrated building blocks and nebular ingassing could at least in principle supply several oceans' worth. The water that planets sequester over eons in their solid deep mantles is limited by the water concentration at water saturation of nominally anhydrous mantle minerals, likely less than 2000 ppm of the planet mass. Water is cycled between mantle and surface through outgassing and ingassing mechanisms that, while tightly linked to tectonics, do not necessarily require plate tectonics in every case. The actual water/land ratio at a given time emerges from the balance between the volume of surface water on the one hand, and on the other hand, the shape of the planet (its ocean basin volume) that is carved out by dynamic topography, the petrologic evolution of continents, impact cratering, and other surface-sculpting processes. By leveraging the contrast in reflectance properties of water and land surfaces, spatially resolved 2D maps of Earth-as-an-exoplanet have been retrieved from models using real Earth observations, demonstrating that water/land ratios of rocky exoplanets may be determined from data delivered by large-aperture, high-contrast imaging telescopes in the future."

We argue that three main factors lead to the variations in our design decisions: different expectations and understandings of our student populations, variations in our ancillary pedagogical goals, and fine grained differences in our theoretical perspectives. By focusing on the differences between our labs, we highlight the limitations of theory alone to determine curriculum development and demonstrate the process of theory, in conversation with local particularities, guiding design."

Advancements in the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating human-sounding text have greatly increased the amount of human-to-computer interaction. As this field grows, the cultural alignment of these human-like agents becomes an important field of study. Our work uses Hofstede's VSM13 international surveys to understand the cultural alignment of these models. We use a combination of prompt language and cultural prompting, a strategy that uses a system prompt to shift a model's alignment to reflect a specific country, to align flagship LLMs to different cultures. Our results show that DeepSeek-V3, V3.1, and OpenAI's GPT-5 exhibit a close alignment with the survey responses of the United States and do not achieve a strong or soft alignment with China, even when using cultural prompts or changing the prompt language. We also find that GPT-4 exhibits an alignment closer to China when prompted in English, but cultural prompting is effective in shifting this alignment closer to the United States. Other low-cost models, GPT-4o and GPT-4.1, respond to the prompt language used (i.e., English or Simplified Chinese) and cultural prompting strategies to create acceptable alignments with both the United States and China."

We present a prompt-based approach that leverages LLMs to guide hierarchical decomposition of complex proof obligations into simpler sub-claims, while relying on symbolic provers for verification. Our key insight is to constrain LLMs to generate normalized claim decompositions rather than complete proofs, significantly reducing syntax errors. We also introduce a benchmark suite of 119 theorems adapted from (1) established mathematical collections and (2) inductive proofs of distributed protocols. Our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods across the benchmark suite."

Existing work either relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) that over-fits surface cues and yields low diversity, or applies reinforcement learning (RL) that fails to learn multiple dimensions for comprehensive RPA optimization. We present MOA (Multi-Objective Alignment), a reinforcement-learning framework that enables multi-dimensional, fine-grained rubric optimization for general RPAs. MOA introduces a novel multi-objective optimization strategy that trains simultaneously on multiple fine-grained rubrics to boost optimization performance. Besides, to address the issues of model output diversity and quality, we have also employed thought-augmented rollout with off-policy guidance. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks such as PersonaGym and RoleMRC show that MOA enables an 8B model to match or even outperform strong baselines such as GPT-4o and Claude across numerous dimensions. This demonstrates the great potential of MOA in building RPAs that can simultaneously meet the demands of role knowledge, persona style, diverse scenarios, and complex multi-turn conversations."

The analysis focuses on two primary types of clusters: widespread, dispersed clusters and younger, compact massive clusters, both of which host shock waves generated by supernova remnants (SNR). Clusters located near the solar system, within a 3-kiloparsec radius,are identified. Analytical methods are used to calculate energy spectra and gamma-ray production rates. The findings suggest that young and compact MSC contribute to multi-TeV to PeV gamma-ray emission, with the dominant contribution arising from nearby populations."

Studying these reactions in terrestrial laboratories presents serious challenges and often requires developing ingenious instrumentation and detection techniques. Here, we reveal how some of the major breakthroughs in our quest to unveil the inner workings of stars have come from the most unexpected of places: deep underground.

    "abstract": "Magnetic fields pervade astrophysical systems and strongly influence their dynamics. Because magnetic diffusion is usually much faster than system evolution, ancient fields cannot explain the present magnetization of planets, stars, and galaxies. Instead, self-sustaining dynamos, which convert fluid motion into magnetic energy, offer the most robust explanation. Numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations are essential to understanding this phenomenon. This thesis uses numerical models of self-excited dynamos in two contexts: the interstellar medium (ISM) and the interiors of gas giant planets. First, I use 3D MHD simulations with the Pencil Code to study magnetic growth from irrotational, subsonic expansion flows, a simplified representation of supernova-driven motions in the ISM. These curl-free flows mimic stellar explosions and winds, drive turbulence, and seed magnetic amplification. The second part examines planetary dynamos. I outline the properties of planetary magnetic fields and their modeling through convection in spherical shells. Although many exoplanets are known, their magnetic fields remain difficult to detect, but may be observable through coherent radio emission with new low-frequency instruments. Using 3D dynamo simulations with the MagIC code, coupled to thermodynamic profiles from MESA-based evolution models, I study the magnetic evolution of cold gas giants. The models show a slow decline in field strength, a shift from multipolar to dipolar states, and clear evolutionary trends in dynamo behavior. I also investigate hot Jupiters, where strong irradiation alters convection and rotation. Most remain fast rotators, but massive, distant planets may enter different regimes. When heating is concentrated in outer layers, convection in the dynamo region weakens, reducing expected field strengths and helping explain the absence of confirmed detections in past radio surveys."

    "abstract": "Water utilities are increasingly concerned about losses, leaks, and illegal connections in their distribution networks. Pressure control is typically managed through pressure reducing valves with electrically controlled actuators based on predefined tables according to the pressure at the critical point control. This openloop control method lacks direct feedback between the PRV and CPC, making it challenging to distinguish whether pressure variations originate from normal head losses or abnormal network conditions. Unlike traditional applications of ARIMA focused on water demand forecasting, this study explores its novel use in pressure management within distribution networks, aiming to predict P3 pressure based on head losses across a defined hydraulic sector. To achieve this objective, a predictive model based on the Box-Jenkins methodology and its variations is implemented to analyse time series data. An action path is established to determine the optimal model ARIMA, ARMA, ARMAX, etc. which is subsequently validated using real operational data from Noja, a coastal town in northern Spain characterized by significant seasonal population fluctuations. By accurately forecasting CPC pressure, this system enhances the detection of anomalous patterns, enabling more efficient network pressure management. The study demonstrates the potential of advanced modelling techniques in optimizing water distribution networks, providing valuable insights to improve system efficiency, reliability, and sustainability in urban environments."

    "abstract": "In a series of recent papers we have proved rigorously that time travel is a reality and very much feasible by using quantum mechanical processes. There are plenty of indirect experimental support untill a direct experiment is conducted. The process crucially depend on the reality of a local time as well as a local partial density of states (LPDOS) that can become negative very easily in the quantum regime of mesoscopic systems. Mesoscopic systems are small enough to allow us to experimentally access the intemediate regime between the classical and quantum worlds. This LPDOS is in every sense a hidden variable in quantum mechanics that does not show up in the axiomatic framework of quantum mechanics. It can be infered through physical clocks obeying quantum dynamics and can be rigorously justified from the properties of the Hilbert space that is uniquely isomorphic to the complex plane. Therefore one can naturally guess that LPDOS will have something important to say about quantum measurement as well as the unification of classical and quantum laws. We therefore undertake the exercise to show that LPDOS can very much allow us to re-interpret the enormously successful phenomenological Landauer-Buttiker formalism for mesoscopic systems and put it on firm theoretical ground as a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics, thereby unifying them. Essentialy the local time calculated quantum mechanically can dialate exactly like the proper time of relativity and be consistent with the coordinate time of relativity. Also the measured conductance of mesoscopic samples is a deterministic quantum measurement outcome from a linear superposition of states, essentially because of LPDOS, which solves the quantum measurement problem. For this we analyze the three probe conductance formula in details and give our arguements for the general case."

    "abstract": "The work analytically substantiates the parameters of the surface wave found in numerical modelling of the collision of two oncoming supersonic plasma flows inside a magnetic arc in application to the experiment on the laboratory setup ``Solar Wind'' (Inst. Appl. Phys RAS). An ion-acoustic surface wave exists in the regime of dense plasma flows when their dynamic pressure is of the order of the pressure of an undisturbed magnetic field, so that the flows push the initial magnetic field out of their volume. The wave frequency is in the range between the ion gyrofrequencies inside the plasma bundle and in the outer region of the confining magnetic field. In the external rarefied medium, the near-surface structure is a heterogeneous magnetic sound, consistent in pressure and low total polarisation of the medium with the ``isotropic'' ion sound confined from the inside in a dense plasma bundle. The energy of the structure is mainly contained in the kinetic energy of the wave motion of ions inside the tube. At the same time, the electric field strength is sharply increased outside. Firstly, the latter circumstance arises from the need to maintain a uniform electron electric drift velocity inside the transition layer. Secondly, the energetically weak ion sound propagating into the outer environment is close to electrostatic ion oscillations below the ion gyrofrequency in the external region, which are characterised by increased electric field strength across the ambient magnetic field."

    "abstract": "Despite the popularity of homogeneous GPU-based deep learning (DL) training, the prevalence, causes and impact of stragglers and the effectiveness of existing straggler mitigation approaches are still not well understood in this scenario due to limited research on these questions. To fill this gap, we conducted comprehensive experiments and found that stragglers remain widespread due to CPU and bandwidth usage imbalances. Additionally, existing mitigation methods that switch from synchronous stochastic gradient descent (SSGD) to asynchronous SGD (ASGD) may not improve Time-To-Accuracy (TTA) and can even generate more stragglers due to its higher resource consumption. To address these newly found problems, we propose the Straggler Tolerant And Resilient DL training system (STAR). STAR includes new synchronization modes that group workers for each parameter updating. It has a heuristic and an ML method to choose the optimal synchronization mode for minimizing TTA, and reallocates resources to support the selected mode while minimizing the impact on co-located jobs. Moreover, it proactively prevents stragglers by avoiding overloading the CPU and bandwidth resources in allocating PSs (which consume high CPU and bandwidth) and in gradient transmission. Our trace-driven evaluation on AWS shows that STAR generates 48-84% and 51-70% lower TTA than state-of-the-art systems in the PS and all-reduce architectures, respectively, while maintaining the converged accuracy of SSGD. The code for STAR is open-sourced."

    "abstract": "Seamless phase II/III trials have become a cornerstone of modern drug development, offering a means to accelerate evaluation while maintaining statistical rigor. However, most existing inference procedures are model-based, designed primarily for continuous outcomes, and often neglect the stratification used in covariate-adaptive randomization (CAR), limiting their practical relevance. In this paper, we propose a unified, model-robust framework for seamless phase II/III trials grounded in generalized linear models (GLMs), enabling valid inference across diverse outcome types, estimands, and CAR schemes. Using Z-estimation, we derive the asymptotic properties of treatment effect estimators and explicitly characterize how their variance depends on the underlying randomization procedure.Based on these results, we develop adjusted Wald tests that, together with Dunnett's multiple-comparison procedure and the inverse chi-square combination method, ensure valid overall Type I error. Extensive simulation studies and a trial example demonstrate that the proposed model-robust tests achieve superior power and reliable inference compared to conventional approaches."

We propose the Motion Conditioned Diffusion Model (MCDM), a label-free latent diffusion framework that synthesises realistic echocardiography videos conditioned on self-supervised motion features. To extract these features, we design the Motion and Appearance Feature Extractor (MAFE), which disentangles motion and appearance representations from videos. Feature learning is further enhanced by two auxiliary objectives: a re-identification loss guided by pseudo appearance features and an optical flow loss guided by pseudo flow fields. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, MCDM achieves competitive video generation performance, producing temporally coherent and clinically realistic sequences without reliance on manual labels. These results demonstrate the potential of self-supervised conditioning for scalable echocardiography synthesis. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZheLi2020/LabelfreeMCDM."

Our key idea is to generate cross-view consistent image pairs that are well-aligned with the source and target point clouds, enabling geometry-color feature fusion to facilitate robust matching. To ensure high-quality matching, the generated image pair should feature both 2D-3D geometric consistency and cross-view texture consistency. To achieve this, we introduce Match-ControlNet, a matching-specific, controllable 2D generative model. Specifically, it leverages the depth-conditioned generation capability of ControlNet to produce images that are geometrically aligned with depth maps derived from point clouds, ensuring 2D-3D geometric consistency. Additionally, by incorporating a coupled conditional denoising scheme and coupled prompt guidance, Match-ControlNet further promotes cross-view feature interaction, guiding texture consistency generation. Our generative 3D registration paradigm is general and could be seamlessly integrated into various registration methods to enhance their performance. Extensive experiments on 3DMatch and ScanNet datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach."

In particular, the gravity-mode (g-mode) pulsators, which allow inference of stellar near-core properties have not been analysed yet. We aim to identify and analyse the population of g-mode pulsators in the Pleiades. Our focus lies on the internal rotation as measured from asteroseismology to obtain a well defined sample of stellar rotation on the early main sequence. Based on full-frame images from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we constructed light curves for intermediate-mass Pleiades members and searched for g-mode pulsators among them. For pulsators exhibiting period spacing patterns, we determined their near-core rotation rate and buoyancy periods. For all other g-mode pulsators, we estimated the near-core rotation rate based on the dominant mode frequency to obtain a comprehensive rotation rate distribution. Among our 105 target stars, we find 28 g-mode pulsators distributed across the entire upper main sequence, 19 of which are hybrid pulsators, but only three stars exhibit period spacing patterns in the current TESS data. The near-core rotation rates in A- and early F-type members are distributed between 1 and 3 d$^{-1}$ without any clear mass-dependence. This distribution is much broader than the one in the similar open cluster NGC 2516. A comparison of the buoyancy periods shows that the Pleiades and NGC 2516 are of similar asteroseismic age. With the large population of g-mode and hybrid pulsators, the Pleiades constitute a valuable asteroseismic benchmark cluster, reaffirming its important role in stellar astrophysics."

    "abstract": "Background. Subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common neurosurgical emergency, with increasing incidence in aging populations. Rapid and accurate identification is essential to guide timely intervention, yet existing automated tools focus primarily on detection and provide limited interpretability or spatial localization. There remains a need for transparent, high-performing systems that integrate multimodal clinical and imaging information to support real-time decision-making. Methods. We developed a multimodal deep-learning framework that integrates structured clinical variables, a 3D convolutional neural network trained on CT volumes, and a transformer-enhanced 2D segmentation model for SDH detection and localization. Using 25,315 head CT studies from Hartford HealthCare (2015--2024), of which 3,774 (14.9\\%) contained clinician-confirmed SDH, tabular models were trained on demographics, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory results. Imaging models were trained to detect SDH and generate voxel-level probability maps. A greedy ensemble strategy combined complementary predictors. Findings. Clinical variables alone provided modest discriminatory power (AUC 0.75). Convolutional models trained on CT volumes and segmentation-derived maps achieved substantially higher accuracy (AUCs 0.922 and 0.926). The multimodal ensemble integrating all components achieved the best overall performance (AUC 0.9407; 95\\% CI, 0.930--0.951) and produced anatomically meaningful localization maps consistent with known SDH patterns. Interpretation. This multimodal, interpretable framework provides rapid and accurate SDH detection and localization, achieving high detection performance and offering transparent, anatomically grounded outputs. Integration into radiology workflows could streamline triage, reduce time to intervention, and improve consistency in SDH management."

    "abstract": "White balance (WB) is a key step in the image signal processor (ISP) pipeline that mitigates color casts caused by varying illumination and restores the scene's true colors. Currently, sRGB-based WB editing for post-ISP WB correction is widely used to address color constancy failures in the ISP pipeline when the original camera RAW is unavailable. However, additive color models (e.g., sRGB) are inherently limited by fixed nonlinear transformations and entangled color channels, which often impede their generalization to complex lighting conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for WB correction that leverages a perception-inspired Learnable HSI (LHSI) color space. Built upon a cylindrical color model that naturally separates luminance from chromatic components, our framework further introduces dedicated parameters to enhance this disentanglement and learnable mapping to adaptively refine the flexibility. Moreover, a new Mamba-based network is introduced, which is tailored to the characteristics of the proposed LHSI color space. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting the potential of perception-inspired color space design in computational photography.

    "abstract": "Deep learning methods have proven capable of recovering operators between high-dimensional spaces, such as solution maps of PDEs and similar objects in mathematical physics, from very few training samples. This phenomenon of data-efficiency has been proven for certain classes of elliptic operators with simple geometry, i.e., operators that do not change the domain of the function or propagate singularities. However, scientific machine learning is commonly used for problems that do involve the propagation of singularities in a priori unknown ways, such as waves, advection, and fluid dynamics. In light of this, we expand the learning theory to include double fibration transforms--geometric integral operators that include generalized Radon and geodesic ray transforms. We prove that this class of operators does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the error decays superalgebraically, that is, faster than any fixed power of the reciprocal of the number of training samples. Furthermore, we investigate architectures that explicitly encode the geometry of these transforms, demonstrating that an architecture reminiscent of cross-attention based on levelset methods yields a parameterization that is universal, stable, and learns double fibration transforms from very few training examples. Our results contribute to a rapidly-growing line of theoretical work on learning operators for scientific machine learning."

Our approach interleaves local neo-Hebbian-like updates during task execution with an outer loop that optimizes plasticity parameters via \\textbf{tangent-propagation through learning}.

These non-Hermitian descriptions are, however, not capable of describing empirical processes of more general nature, including but not limited to a variety of pumping processes. We extend the state-to-state analysis to account for Lindbladian descriptions of generic dissipative, pumping and decohering processes acting on a system which is exchanging energy with a thermal bath. This Lindblad state-to-state method can elucidate routes of transport in systems coupled to a bath and additionally acted upon by Lindblad jump operators. The method is demonstrated using examples of excitonic aggregates subject to incoherent pumping and draining processes. Using this new state-to-state formalism, we demonstrate the establishment of steady-state excitonic currents across molecular aggregates, yielding a different first-principles approach to quantifying the same."

Dense frame encoding generates excessive visual tokens, leading to high memory consumption, redundant computation, and limited scalability in real-world applications. This inefficiency highlights a key limitation of the traditional process-then-reason paradigm, which analyzes visual streams exhaustively before semantic reasoning. To address this challenge, we introduce Video-QTR (Query-Driven Temporal Reasoning), a lightweight framework that redefines video comprehension as a query-guided reasoning process. Instead of encoding every frame, Video-QTR dynamically allocates perceptual resources based on the semantic intent of the query, creating an adaptive feedback loop between reasoning and perception. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks: MSVD-QA, Activity Net-QA, Movie Chat, and Video MME demonstrate that Video-QTR achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing input frame consumption by up to 73%. These results confirm that query-driven temporal reasoning provides an efficient and scalable solution for video understanding."

In GPS-denied or cluttered urban environments, perception-based landing is vital for reliable operation. Unlike structured landing zones, real-world sites are unstructured and highly variable, requiring strong generalization capabilities from the perception system. Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide a scalable solution for learning landing site features across diverse visual and environmental conditions. While perception-driven landing has been shown in simulation, real-world deployment introduces significant challenges. Payload and volume constraints limit high-performance edge AI devices like the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, which are crucial for real-time detection and control. Accurate pose estimation during descent is necessary, especially in the absence of GPS, and relies on dependable visual-inertial odometry. Achieving this with limited edge AI resources requires careful optimization of the entire deployment framework. The flight characteristics of large QuadPlanes further complicate the problem. These aircraft exhibit high inertia, reduced thrust vectoring, and slow response times further complicate stable landing maneuvers. This work presents a lightweight QuadPlane system for efficient vision-based autonomous landing and visual-inertial odometry, specifically developed for long-range QuadPlane operations such as aerial monitoring. It describes the hardware platform, sensor configuration, and embedded computing architecture designed to meet demanding real-time, physical constraints.

Using this property, we derive a multi-level algorithm based on collision event propagator and show, both analytically and through numerical experiments, that it reproduces the results of standard Monte Carlo methods. We further demonstrate that, in the context of coupled plasma-neutral edge simulations employing correlated Monte Carlo, the proposed scheme retains trajectory correlation to machine precision as the system evolves, whereas conventional methods exhibit rapid decorrelation. These results indicate that the propagator-based multi-level Monte Carlo scheme is a promising candidate for use in fully implicit Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) solvers for coupled plasma-neutral systems."

This is in part because high-quality annotated data are far more difficult to obtain for proteins than for natural language. We present a simple and general recipe for fast SFT of PLMs, designed to improve the fidelity, reliability, and novelty of generated protein sequences. Unlike existing approaches that require costly precompiled experimental datasets for SFT, our method leverages the PLM itself, integrating a lightweight curation pipeline with domain-specific filters to construct high-quality training data. These filters can independently refine a PLM's output and identify candidates for in vitro evaluation; when combined with SFT, they enable PLMs to generate more stable and functional enzymes, while expanding exploration into protein sequence space beyond natural variants. Although our approach is agnostic to both the choice of protein language model (PLM) and the protein system, we demonstrate its effectiveness with a genome-scale PLM (GenSLM) applied to the tryptophan synthase enzyme family. The supervised fine-tuned model generates sequences that are not only more novel but also display improved characteristics across both targeted design constraints and emergent protein property measures."

Here, we establish a chiral Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$T$_{x}$ MXene platform bridging molecular chirality and mechanical actuation. Phenylalanine enantiomers are covalently anchored onto MXene nanoflakes via chiral nanopainting. The 2D confinement forces ligands into vertically aligned supramolecular networks. Interlayer-spacing analysis and simulations corroborate that such supramolecular networks unlock exceptionally broadband circular dichroism from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared. This supramolecular chirality synergizes with MXene's plasmonic properties to drive handedness-dependent photothermal conversion, with a 30\\% differential temperature rise between matched and mismatched CPL. Embedding this chiral MXene into thermoresponsive hydrogels realizes, to the best of our knowledge, the first CPL-driven soft actuator that implements LCP/RCP/off as a ternary input to program multidirectional deformation based on a photothermal mechanism. This molecular-to-macroscopic translation demonstrates a new paradigm for chirality-encoded soft robotics and adaptive photonics."

    "abstract": "The Mpemba effect (MpE), where a far-from-equilibrium state of a system relaxes faster compared to a state closer to it, is a well-known counterintuitive phenomenon in classical and quantum systems. Various system-specific theories have been proposed to explain this anomalous behavior in driven systems, though the fundamental mechanism of MpE in undriven systems, where MpE was first observed, remains unresolved. This paper provides a generic model of MpE for a quantum system following Markovian relaxation dynamics, regardless of system structure or environment. The key lies in the overlap of initial states with the fast relaxation mode; here, the constituents create a fast decay mode via interaction through the shared environment to show MpE, indicating MpE happens due to the collective behavior of the system. I also show that a system with anisotropic relaxation naturally exhibits MpE, even without a shared environment among the particles."

    "abstract": "Self supervised learning (SSL) is a machine learning paradigm where models learn to understand the underlying structure of data without explicit supervision from labeled samples. The acquired representations from SSL have demonstrated useful for many downstream tasks including clustering, and linear classification, etc. To ensure smoothness of the representation space, most SSL methods rely on the ability to generate pairs of observations that are similar to a given instance. However, generating these pairs may be challenging for many types of data. Moreover, these methods lack consideration of uncertainty quantification and can perform poorly in out-of-sample prediction settings. To address these limitations, we propose Gaussian process self supervised learning (GPSSL), a novel approach that utilizes Gaussian processes (GP) models on representation learning. GP priors are imposed on the representations, and we obtain a generalized Bayesian posterior minimizing a loss function that encourages informative representations. The covariance function inherent in GPs naturally pulls representations of similar units together, serving as an alternative to using explicitly defined positive samples. We show that GPSSL is closely related to both kernel PCA and VICReg, a popular neural network-based SSL method, but unlike both allows for posterior uncertainties that can be propagated to downstream tasks. Experiments on various datasets, considering classification and regression tasks, demonstrate that GPSSL outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy, uncertainty quantification, and error control."

    "abstract": "Prompt injection attacks aim to contaminate the input data of an LLM to mislead it into completing an attacker-chosen task instead of the intended task. In many applications and agents, the input data originates from multiple sources, with each source contributing a segment of the overall input. In these multi-source scenarios, an attacker may control only a subset of the sources and contaminate the corresponding segments, but typically does not know the order in which the segments are arranged within the input. Existing prompt injection attacks either assume that the entire input data comes from a single source under the attacker's control or ignore the uncertainty in the ordering of segments from different sources. As a result, their success is limited in domains involving multi-source data. In this work, we propose ObliInjection, the first prompt injection attack targeting LLM applications and agents with multi-source input data. ObliInjection introduces two key technical innovations: the order-oblivious loss, which quantifies the likelihood that the LLM will complete the attacker-chosen task regardless of how the clean and contaminated segments are ordered; and the orderGCG algorithm, which is tailored to minimize the order-oblivious loss and optimize the contaminated segments. Comprehensive experiments across three datasets spanning diverse application domains and twelve LLMs demonstrate that ObliInjection is highly effective, even when only one out of 6-100 segments in the input data is contaminated."

    "abstract": "Industrial cyber physical systems operate under heterogeneous sensing, stochastic dynamics, and shifting process conditions, producing data that are often incomplete, unlabeled, imbalanced, and domain shifted. High-fidelity datasets remain costly, confidential, and slow to obtain, while edge devices face strict limits on latency, bandwidth, and energy. These factors restrict the practicality of centralized deep learning, hinder the development of reliable digital twins, and increase the risk of error escape in safety-critical applications. Motivated by these challenges, this dissertation develops an efficiency grounded computational framework that enables data lean, physics-aware, and deployment ready intelligence for modern manufacturing environments. The research advances methods that collectively address core bottlenecks across multimodal and multiscale industrial scenarios. Generative strategies mitigate data scarcity and imbalance, while semi-supervised learning integrates unlabeled information to reduce annotation and simulation demands. Physics-informed representation learning strengthens interpretability and improves condition monitoring under small-data regimes. Spatially aware graph-based surrogate modeling provides efficient approximation of complex processes, and an edge cloud collaborative compression scheme supports real-time signal analytics under resource constraints. The dissertation also extends visual understanding through zero-shot vision language reasoning augmented by domain specific retrieval, enabling generalizable assessment in previously unseen scenarios. Together, these developments establish a unified paradigm of data efficient and resource aware intelligence that bridges laboratory learning with industrial deployment, supporting reliable decision-making across diverse manufacturing systems."

Despite extensive research on learning with noisy labels (LNL), the robustness of existing methods in medical imaging has not been systematically assessed. To address this gap, we introduce LNMBench, a comprehensive benchmark for Label Noise in Medical imaging. LNMBench encompasses \\textbf{10} representative methods evaluated across 7 datasets, 6 imaging modalities, and 3 noise patterns, establishing a unified and reproducible framework for robustness evaluation under realistic conditions. Comprehensive experiments reveal that the performance of existing LNL methods degrades substantially under high and real-world noise, highlighting the persistent challenges of class imbalance and domain variability in medical data. Motivated by these findings, we further propose a simple yet effective improvement to enhance model robustness under such conditions. The LNMBench codebase is publicly released to facilitate standardized evaluation, promote reproducible research, and provide practical insights for developing noise-resilient algorithms in both research and real-world medical applications.The codebase is publicly available on https://github.com/myyy777/LNMBench."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, visual intelligence tools have become ubiquitous, offering all kinds of convenience and possibilities. However, these tools have high computational requirements that exceed the capabilities of resource-constrained mobile and wearable devices. While offloading visual data to the cloud is a common solution, it introduces significant privacy vulnerabilities during transmission and server-side computation. To address this, we propose a novel distributed, hierarchical offloading framework for Vision Transformers (ViTs) that addresses these privacy challenges by design. Our approach uses a local trusted edge device, such as a mobile phone or an Nvidia Jetson, as the edge orchestrator. This orchestrator partitions the user's visual data into smaller portions and distributes them across multiple independent cloud servers. By design, no single external server possesses the complete image, preventing comprehensive data reconstruction. The final data merging and aggregation computation occurs exclusively on the user's trusted edge device. We apply our framework to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) as a practical case study, which demonstrates that our method substantially enhances content privacy over traditional cloud-based approaches. Evaluations show our framework maintains near-baseline segmentation performance while substantially reducing the risk of content reconstruction and user data exposure. Our framework provides a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for vision tasks in the edge-cloud continuum."

    "abstract": "We present a dynamical analysis of galaxy clusters identified in the VIPERS spectroscopic survey within the redshift range 0.5 <= z <= 1.2. Cluster candidates were first detected as overdense regions in redshift space through the Finger-of-God (FoG) effect, and cluster membership was assigned using the GalWeight technique within the FoG-GalWeight methodology developed by our team. For each cluster, we derived the virial radius (R200), velocity dispersion (sigma200), and virial mass (M200) using the virial mass estimator. We identified ten VIPERS clusters spanning a mass range of 0.59 x 10^14 <= M200/(h^-1 Msun) <= 4.32 x 10^14 and velocity dispersions of 360 <= sigma200 <= 900 km s^-1. We cross-matched the VIPERS clusters with published catalogs and found at least one matching system for each cluster, offering external validation for our detections. We investigated the velocity dispersion-mass relation for these systems and obtained log(sigma200) = (2.73 +/- 0.06) + (0.36 +/- 0.18) log(M200), with an intrinsic scatter of sigma_int = 0.04 +/- 0.07. The derived relation is consistent with theoretical predictions from N-body and hydrodynamical simulations, confirming the reliability of the FoG-GalWeight methodology and the robustness of the virial mass estimator. Our findings demonstrate that the velocity dispersion can serve as a reliable and direct proxy for cluster mass, even at high redshift, without requiring additional dynamical mass modeling."

Let $Q$ denote the distribution of $Y$. We introduce a hierarchy of denoisers $T_0, T_1, \\ldots, T_\\infty : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that are agnostic to the signal distribution $P$, depending only on higher-order score functions of $Q$. Each denoiser $T_K$ is progressively refined using the $(2K-1)$-th order score function of $Q$ at noise resolution $σ^{2K}$, achieving better denoising quality measured by the Wasserstein metric $W(T_K \\sharp Q, P)$. The limiting denoiser $T_\\infty$ identifies the optimal transport map with $T_\\infty \\sharp Q = P$. We provide a complete characterization of the combinatorial structure underlying this hierarchy through Bell polynomial recursions, revealing how higher-order score functions encode the optimal transport map for signal denoising. We study two estimation strategies with convergence rates for higher-order scores from i.i.d. samples drawn from $Q$: (i) plug-in estimation via Gaussian kernel smoothing, and (ii) direct estimation via higher-order score matching. This hierarchy of agnostic denoisers opens new perspectives in signal denoising and empirical Bayes."

    "abstract": "Real-time state tracking of Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) is critical for enabling robotic manipulation of DLOs in industrial assembly, medical procedures, and daily-life applications. However, the high-dimensional configuration space, nonlinear dynamics, and frequent partial occlusions present fundamental barriers to robust real-time DLO tracking. To address these limitations, this study introduces UPETrack, a geometry-driven framework based on Unidirectional Position Estimation (UPE), which facilitates tracking without the requirement for physical modeling, virtual simulation, or visual markers. The framework operates in two phases: (1) visible segment tracking is based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) fitted via the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, and (2) occlusion region prediction employing UPE algorithm we proposed. UPE leverages the geometric continuity inherent in DLO shapes and their temporal evolution patterns to derive a closed-form positional estimator through three principal mechanisms: (i) local linear combination displacement term, (ii) proximal linear constraint term, and (iii) historical curvature term. This analytical formulation allows efficient and stable estimation of occluded nodes through explicit linear combinations of geometric components, eliminating the need for additional iterative optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that UPETrack surpasses two state-of-the-art tracking algorithms, including TrackDLO and CDCPD2, in both positioning accuracy and computational efficiency."

Our result shows that PE systematically enlarges the generalization gap. Extending to the adversarial setting, we derive the adversarial Rademacher generalization bound. We find that the gap between models with and without PE is magnified under attack, demonstrating that PE amplifies the vulnerability of models. Our bounds are empirically validated by a simulation study. Together, this work establishes a new framework for understanding the clean and adversarial generalization in ICL with PE."

    "abstract": "Radio emission from pulsars is known to exhibit a diverse range of emission phenomena, among which nulling, where the emission becomes temporarily undetectable, is an intriguing one. Observations suggest nulling is prevalent in many long-period pulsars and must be understood to obtain a more comprehensive picture of pulsar emission and its evolution. One of the limitations in observational characterisation of nulling is the limited signal-to-noise, making individual pulses often not easily distinguishable from noise or any putative faint emission. Although some of the approaches in the published literature attempt to address this, they lose efficacy when individual pulses appear indistinguishable from the noise, and as a result, can lead to less accurate measurements. Here we develop a new method (the $\\mathbb{N}$sum algorithm) that uses sums of pulses for better distinguishability from noise and thus measures the nulling fraction more robustly. It can be employed for measuring nulling fractions in weaker pulsars and observations with a limited number of observed pulses. We compare our algorithm with the recently developed Gaussian Mixture Modelling approach, using both simulated and real data, and find that our approach yields consistent results for generic and weaker pulsars. We also explore quasi-periodicity in nulling and measure the related parameters for five pulsars, including PSRs~J1453$-$6413, J0950$+$0755 and J0026$-$1955, for which these are also the first such measurements. We compare and contrast our analysis of quasi-periodic nulling with previously published work and explore the use of spin-down energy loss ($\\dot E$) to distinguish between different types of modulation behaviour."

The Causal-Temporal dimension encompasses three subtypes - Sequential, Branch, and Event - that together account for control flow in both procedural and event-driven environments. A Compositional Ladder provides a visual parallel between literacy progressions and programming structures, illustrating how recursive composition operates from blocks and statements through segments, systems, and services. The framework aims to address conceptual and cognitive-load limitations reported in FLARE v1 and is situated within semiotic and program-comprehension theory. FLARE v2 is presented as a conceptual lens with potential implications for pedagogy and curriculum design; implementation and empirical evaluation are left for future work."

This architectural constraint introduces significant friction for new users and slows down the experimental iteration cycle. This paper introduces GEARS (Geant4 Example Application with Rich features yet Small footprint), a universally applicable Geant4 application that fundamentally addresses this issue. GEARS achieves complete simulation configurability without C++ recompilation by strictly utilizing external configuration methods: Geometry is defined via simple text-based configuration, the Physics List is selected via the standard PHYSLIST environment variable, and the Primary Source is defined through the General Particle Source (GPS) macro commands. Furthermore, regarding GEARS as an application instead of a framework, key features include a flat ntuple structure with short variable names for highly efficient analysis and a solution for capturing vital step zero data. Output creation is also fully managed via run-time macro commands and volume properties. The project is distributed as a ready-to-use Docker container to eliminate compilation barriers. Through these design considerations, GEARS transforms Geant4 into a practical, ready-to-use tool, enabling users to rapidly prototype and execute simulations for diverse experiments solely through simple text configuration files, without ever needing to modify or compile the underlying C++ source code."

However, they are rarely detected in a cool, low-ionized state within CMEs measured in situ, making their evolution hard to study. We examine the thermodynamic evolution of one of these rare cases where a quiescent prominence eruption clearly preserves its low-ionized charge state as evidenced by in situ detection. We use multi-viewpoint Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) observations to track and estimate the density, temperature and speed of the prominence as it erupts. We observe that part of the prominence remains in absorption well beyond initial liftoff, indicating the bulk of the prominence experiences minimal ionization and suggesting any strong heating is balanced by radiative losses, expansion, or conduction. From its subsequent in situ passage near 1au, charge states reveal that the prominence is composed of both cool, low-ionized ions as well as hotter plasma reflected by the presence of highly ionized iron, Fe$^{16+}$. Simulated non-equilibrium ionization and recombination results using observationally derived initial conditions match the in situ multi-thermal state for a prominence composed of 70% cool plasma with a 1.8MK peak temperature, and 30% hot plasma with a 4.3MK peak temperature. This suggests that the prominence may not be heated uniformly or that parts of it cools more rapidly. The complex, multi-thermal nature of this erupting prominence emphasizes the need for more comprehensive spectral observations of the global corona."

This system enables DNA synthesizers to screen order requests against a database of hazards. By applying novel cryptography, the system aims to keep order requests and the database of hazards secret. Discerning the detailed operation of the system in part from source code (Version 1.0.8), our analysis examines key management, certificate infrastructure, authentication, and rate-limiting mechanisms. We also perform the first formal-methods analysis of the mutual authentication, basic request, and exemption-handling protocols. Without breaking the cryptography, our main finding is that SecureDNA's custom mutual authentication protocol SCEP achieves only one-way authentication: the hazards database and keyservers never learn with whom they communicate. This structural weakness violates the principle of defense in depth and enables an adversary to circumvent rate limits that protect the secrecy of the hazards database, if the synthesizer connects with a malicious or corrupted keyserver or hashed database. We point out an additional structural weakness that also violates the principle of defense in depth: inadequate cryptographic bindings prevent the system from detecting if responses, within a TLS channel, from the hazards database were modified. Consequently, if a synthesizer were to reconnect with the database over the same TLS session, an adversary could replay and swap responses from the database without breaking TLS. Although the SecureDNA implementation does not allow such reconnections, it would be stronger security engineering to avoid the underlying structural weakness. We identify these vulnerabilities and suggest and verify mitigations, including adding strong bindings. Software Version 1.1.0 fixes SCEP with our proposed SCEP+ protocol."

In particular, we show that, under certain mild assumptions, the image of the natural homomorphism from the automorphism group of a mixed-characteristic local field to the outer automorphism group of the associated absolute Galois group is not a normal subgroup. Furthermore, we show that, for the absolute Galois group of a mixed-characteristic local field satisfying certain assumptions, there exist a continuous representation and a continuous automorphism of the group such that the former is irreducible, abelian, and crystalline, but the continuous representation obtained as the composite of the former with the latter is not even Hodge-Tate. These results significantly generalize previous works by Hoshi and Nishio. A key observation in obtaining these results is to focus on the analogy between the mapping class groups of topological surfaces and the outer automorphism groups of the absolute Galois groups of mixed-characteristic local fields. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first work applying results from the theory of mapping class groups to the anabelian geometry of mixed-characteristic local fields, going beyond a mere analogy between the two."

We achieve highly reversible writing and deleting of skyrmions in the simple cuboid without any artificial defects or pinning sites. The current-induced creation of skyrmions is well-understood through the spin-transfer torque acting on surface spin twists of the spontaneous 3D ferromagnetic state, caused by the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction of the uniaxial Fe3Sn2 magnet with a low-quality factor. Current-induced deletions of skyrmions result from the combined effects of magnetic hysteresis and Joule thermal heating. Our results are replicated consistently through 3D micromagnetic simulations. Our approach offers a viable method for achieving reliable single-bit operations in skyrmionic devices for applications such as random-access memories."

For fundamental device applications, the ability to electrically manipulate individual solitons is crucial. However, electrical manipulation of single antiskyrmions has been rarely demonstrated. In this work, we present current-controlled manipulations, encompassing the creation, deletion, and topological transformation of a single antiskyrmion within FeNiPdP nanostructured cells at room temperature. This nanostructure is uniquely designed with dimensions of about 400 nm in width and length, enabling the stabilization of a single antiskyrmion. By simply adjusting the density of nanosecond single-pulsed currents, we achieve the reversible creation and deletion of single antiskyrmions. Moreover, we uncover a rich variety of current-controlled topological transformations among individual antiskyrmions, skyrmions, bubbles, and ferromagnetic states. Our experimental findings are corroborated by micromagnetic simulations, highlighting the pivotal role of current-induced combined effects, such as spin transfer torque and Joule heating. Our results hold potential for advancing antiskyrmion-based device applications."

    "abstract": "Audio deepfakes have reached a level of realism that makes it increasingly difficult to distinguish between human and artificial voices, which poses risks such as identity theft or spread of disinformation. Despite these concerns, research on humans' ability to identify deepfakes is limited, with most studies focusing on English and very few exploring the reasons behind listeners' perceptual decisions. This study addresses this gap through a perceptual experiment in which 54 listeners (28 native Spanish speakers and 26 native Japanese speakers) classified voices as natural or synthetic, and justified their choices. The experiment included 80 stimuli (50% artificial), organized according to three variables: language (Spanish/Japanese), speech style (audiobooks/interviews), and familiarity with the voice (familiar/unfamiliar). The goal was to examine how these variables influence detection and to analyze qualitatively the reasoning behind listeners' perceptual decisions. Results indicate an average accuracy of 59.11%, with higher performance on authentic samples. Judgments of vocal naturalness rely on a combination of linguistic and non-linguistic cues. Comparing Japanese and Spanish listeners, our qualitative analysis further reveals both shared cues and notable cross-linguistic differences in how listeners conceptualize the \"humanness\" of speech. Overall, participants relied primarily on suprasegmental and higher-level or extralinguistic characteristics - such as intonation, rhythm, fluency, pauses, speed, breathing, and laughter - over segmental features. These findings underscore the complexity of human perceptual strategies in distinguishing natural from artificial speech and align partly with prior research emphasizing the importance of prosody and phenomena typical of spontaneous speech, such as disfluencies."

    "abstract": "The field of automated algorithm design has been advanced by frameworks such as EoH, FunSearch, and Reevo. Yet, their focus on algorithm evolution alone, neglecting the prompts that guide them, limits their effectiveness with LLMs, especially in complex, uncertain environments where they nonetheless implicitly rely on strategies from swarm intelligence optimization algorithms. Recognizing this, we argue that swarm intelligence optimization provides a more generalized and principled foundation for automated design. Consequently, this paper proposes a novel framework for the collaborative evolution of both swarm intelligence algorithms and guiding prompts using a single LLM. To enhance interpretability, we also propose a simple yet efficient evaluation method for prompt templates. The framework was rigorously evaluated on a range of NP problems, where it demonstrated superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art automated design approaches. Experiments with various LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-32B, GPT-5) reveal significantly divergent evolutionary trajectories in the generated prompts, further underscoring the necessity of a structured co-evolution framework. Importantly, our approach maintains leading performance across different models, demonstrating reduced reliance on the most powerful LLMs and enabling more cost-effective deployments. Ablation studies and in-depth analysis of the evolved prompts confirm that collaborative evolution is essential for achieving optimal performance. Our work establishes a new paradigm for swarm intelligence optimization algorithms, underscoring the indispensable role of prompt evolution."

While previous studies have focused on higher frequencies (>5 GHz), we demonstrate magnon-phonon coupling near 2 GHz using spoof surface plasmon polariton (SSPP) waveguides integrated with yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin films of varying thicknesses. SSPP waveguides provide strong slow-wave enhancement, enabling efficient magnon readout in this challenging regime. Systematic measurements reveal the dependence of coupling strength on YIG thickness and phonon wavelength matching, achieving cooperativity C = 1 for a 3 $μ$m film at 2 GHz. Angle-dependent studies uncover coupling to both transverse and longitudinal phonon modes. Further investigation shows that thicker films exhibit rich multimode dynamics between high-order magnons and HBAR phonons. These results establish a robust low-GHz magnomechanical platform, opening pathways for multimode quantum transduction and hardware-efficient quantum technologies."

It is built upon Operational Differencing, a new technique for managing data in terms of high-level operations that include refactorings and schema changes. We use operational differencing to construct an operation-based form of version control on data structures used in programming languages and relational databases. This approach to data version control does fine-grained diffing and merging despite intervening structural transformations like schema changes. It offers users a simplified conceptual model of version control for ad hoc usage: There is no repo; Branching is just copying. The informaton maintained in a repo can be synthesized more precisely from the append-only histories of branches. Branches can be flexibly shared as is commonly done with document files, except with the added benefit of diffing and merging. We conjecture that queries can be operationalized into a sequence of schema and data operations. We develop that idea on a query language fragment containing selects and joins. Operationalized queries are represented as a future timeline that is speculatively executed as a branch off of the present state, returning a value from its hypothetical future. Operationalized queries get rewritten to accommodate schema change \"for free\" by the machinery of operational differencing. Altogether we develop solutions to four of the eight challenge problems of schema evolution identified in a recent paper."

    "abstract": "Quantitative low-energy electron diffraction [LEED $I(V)$] is a powerful method for surface-structure determination, based on a direct comparison of experimentally observed $I(V)$ data with computations for a structure model. As the diffraction intensities $I$ are highly sensitive to subtle structural changes, local structure optimization is essential for assessing the validity of a structure model and finding the best-fit structure. The calculation of diffraction intensities is well established, but the large number of evaluations required for reliable structural optimization renders it computationally demanding. The computational effort is mitigated by the tensor-LEED approximation, which accelerates optimization by applying a perturbative treatment of small deviations from a reference structure. Nevertheless, optimization of complex structures is a tedious process. Here, the problem of surface-structure optimization is reformulated using a tree-based data structure, which helps to avoid redundant function evaluations. In the new tensor-LEED implementation presented in this work, intensities are computed on the fly, eliminating limitations of previous algorithms that are limited to precomputed values at a grid of search parameters. It also enables the use of state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. Implemented in \\textsc{Python} with the JAX library, the method provides access to gradients of the $R$ factor and supports execution on graphics processing units (GPUs). Based on these developments, the computing time can be reduced by more than an order of magnitude."

The ERL tool effectively catalyzes concrete design changes and promotes a shift from narrow technological solutionism to a more reflective, ethics-by-design mindset."

However, its broader implementation has been hindered by the instability and ill-posedness of its reconstruction process, known as phase retrieval, which relies heavily on handcrafted, object-specific constraints. To overcome the key limitations, we propose CDIP, a robust phase-retrieval framework that eliminates the need for such constraints by combining untrained coordinate-based neural fields for static and dynamic reconstructions and a physics-consistent forward model. We evaluate CDIP on simulated and experimental datasets that involve both static samples and dynamic processes, demonstrating that it substantially outperforms classical iterative algorithms and deep-learning baselines in terms of fidelity and stability. These results highlight a paradigm shift in both static and time-resolved CDI reconstruction, providing a broadly applicable framework for coherent imaging modalities such as ptychography and holography, across X-ray, electron, and optical probes."

In this study, we analyze real-world pedestrian behavior at a route split within a busy train station using high-resolution trajectory data collected over a three-year time frame. We disclose a striking tendency for individuals to follow the same path as the person directly in front of them, even in the absence of social ties and even when such a choice leads to a longer travel time. This tendency leads to bursty dynamics, where sequences of pedestrians make identical decisions in succession, leading to strong patterns in collective movement. We employ a stochastic model that includes route costs, randomness, and social imitation to accurately reproduce the observed behavior, highlighting that local imitation behavior is the dominant driver of collective routing choices. These findings highlight how brief, low-level interactions between strangers can scale up to influence large-scale pedestrian movement, with strong implications for crowd management, urban design, and the broader understanding of social behavior in public spaces."

We introduce GAINS (Gaussian-based Inverse rendering from Sparse multi-view captures), a two-stage inverse rendering framework that leverages learning-based priors to stabilize geometry and material estimation. GAINS first refines geometry using monocular depth/normal and diffusion priors, then employs segmentation, intrinsic image decomposition (IID), and diffusion priors to regularize material recovery. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that GAINS significantly improves material parameter accuracy, relighting quality, and novel-view synthesis compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods, especially under sparse-view settings.

In the ocean, zooplankton migrate over vertical distances several orders of magnitude larger than their body length. These swimmers experience changes in their buoyancy relative to the stably stratified ocean water column. The impact of net swimmer buoyancy on the scale of aggregate-scale induced flows remains unresolved. We hypothesize that as the net buoyancy of swimmers becomes increasingly negative the speed of induced flow in the opposite direction of swimming will increase due to changes in the required force to swim upward and thus the momentum imparted on the surrounding fluid. Simultaneous three-dimensional swimmer tracking and two-dimensional two-component flow measurements are used to measure the flow induced by collective vertical migration of Artemia salina. Experiments were designed to modulate the buoyant force on the swimmers by changing environmental salinity. Experimental results supported the hypothesis and were used to develop a theoretical model, which was then used to contextualize results to ocean relevant conditions with non-dimensional analysis."

Their complex microphysical interactions and coupling with turbulence at microscales govern the cloud properties at macroscales, yet remain challenging to observe and quantify under atmospheric conditions. This model intercomparison study utilizes ten model configurations to simulate mixed-phase cloud evolution in the Michigan Technological University's Pi Chamber. The models span a range of frameworks, including box models, direct numerical simulation, and large-eddy simulation models, and incorporate both bin and Lagrangian microphysics. Each model was tuned to reproduce the observed liquid-phase steady state prior to ice injection. Ice particles were then introduced into the domain at various rates to examine cloud glaciation behavior. By the intercomparison design, all models successfully reproduced the observed mean droplet radius and number concentration during the liquid-phase stage. Increasing ice particle injection rates led to consistent qualitative trends across models: depletion of liquid water, reduced total water content, and a shift in particle size distributions toward larger radii. However, quantitative differences arose due to variations in model treatment in dynamics and microphysics, including subgrid-scale turbulence parameterizations, wall forcing, and particle removal parameterizations. Most models that simulate the full chamber retained liquid droplets near the lower boundary, where supersaturation forcing is strongest and droplets are replenished before mixing into the core region. These surviving liquids droplets were absent in simulations assuming a well-mixed domain, excluding the near-wall region, or using coarse grid spacing."

Second, we propose an interactive adaptation method using a calibrated linear combination of LoRA modules. This approach functions as a gate-free mixture of experts, enabling real-time, user-controllable adjustments to domain and style without retraining. Finally, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a novel gradient-based regularization strategy specifically designed for low-rank decomposition matrices. Unlike methods that regularize the full parameter set, our approach weights the penalty on the low-rank updates using historical gradient information. Experimental results indicate that this strategy efficiently preserves prior domain knowledge while facilitating the acquisition of new tasks, offering a scalable paradigm for interactive and continual NMT."

Within a mean-field approximation of the attractive Hubbard model, we obtain the superconducting order parameters on the three inequivalent sublattices and show their strong dependence on $α$, interaction strength, and electron filling. At quasi-flat band filling, a superconducting gap opens and grows power-law fast with interaction strength, instead of the usual slow exponential growth, due to diverging density of states. We calculate the superfluid weight from linear response theory and study its band dispersion and geometric contributions. While the conventional part proportional to band derivatives is suppressed in the quasi-flat band regime, the contribution dominated by the quantum metric grows linearly for small interaction strength. We further demonstrate how tuning $α$ enhances the quantum metric and thus the geometric superfluid weight especially near half-filling, while increasing on-site asymmetries increases the conventional contribution by broadening the quasi-flat band. We obtain the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature and demonstrate its strong dependence and enhancement with the parameter $α$. Our results establish a tunable flat band system, the $α$-$\\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice model, as a candidate for tunable quantum geometry and superfluid weight and as a prototype of related behavior in tunable quantum materials."

We show that these simulations reproduce a wide range of observational constraints. We also compare our simulations with previous predictions based on dark matter-only simulations which generally model the secondary anisotropies independently from one another, concluding that our hydrodynamical simulation mocks perform at least as well as previous mocks in matching the observations whilst retaining self-consistency in the predictions of the different components. Using the model variations in FLAMINGO, we further explore how the signals depend on cosmology and feedback modelling, and we predict cross-correlations between some of the signals that differ significantly from those in previous mocks.

    "abstract": "The strong coupling $α_s$ is extracted with high precision through fits to lattice-QCD data for the static energy. Our theoretical framework is based on R-improving the three-loop fixed-order prediction for the static energy: we remove the $u=1/2$ renormalon and resum the associated large infrared logarithms. Combined with radius-dependent renormalization scales (the so-called profile functions), this procedure extends the range of validity of perturbation theory to distances as large as $\\sim 0.5\\,$fm. In addition, we resum large ultrasoft logarithms to N$^3$LL accuracy using renormalization-group evolution. Since the standard four-loop R-evolution treats N$^4$LL and higher-order contributions asymmetrically, we also incorporate this potential source of bias in our analysis. Our estimate of the perturbative uncertainty is obtained through a random scan over the parameters controlling the profile functions and the implementation of R-evolution. We analyze how the extracted value of $α_s$ depends on the shortest and longest distances included in the fit, on the details of the R-evolution procedure, on the fitting strategy itself, and on the accuracy of ultrasoft resummation. From our final analysis, and after evolution to the $Z$ pole, we obtain $α^{(n_f=5)}_s(m_Z)=0.1170\\pm 0.0009$, a result fully compatible with the world average and with a comparable uncertainty."

    "abstract": "Research has proven that end-to-end malware detectors are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In response, the research community has proposed defenses based on randomized and (de)randomized smoothing. However, these techniques remain susceptible to attacks that insert large adversarial payloads. To address these limitations, we propose a novel defense mechanism designed to harden end-to-end malware detectors by leveraging masking at the byte level. This mechanism operates by generating multiple masked versions of the input file, independently classifying each version, and then applying a threshold-based voting mechanism to produce the final classification. Key to this defense is a deterministic masking strategy that systematically strides a mask across the entire input file. Unlike randomized smoothing defenses, which randomly mask or delete bytes, this structured approach ensures coverage of the file over successive versions. In the best-case scenario, this strategy fully occludes the adversarial payload, effectively neutralizing its influence on the model's decision. In the worst-case scenario, it partially occludes the adversarial payload, reducing its impact on the model's predictions. By occluding the adversarial payload in one or more masked versions, this defense ensures that some input versions remain representative of the file's original intent, allowing the voting mechanism to suppress the influence of the adversarial payload. Results achieved on the EMBER and BODMAS datasets demonstrate the suitability of our defense, outperforming randomized and (de)randomized smoothing defenses against adversarial examples generated with a wide range of functionality-preserving manipulations while maintaining high accuracy on clean examples."

    "abstract": "Correctly parsing mathematical formulas from PDFs is critical for training large language models and building scientific knowledge bases from academic literature, yet existing benchmarks either exclude formulas entirely or lack semantically-aware evaluation metrics. We introduce a novel benchmarking framework centered on synthetically generated PDFs with precise LaTeX ground truth, enabling systematic control over layout, formulas, and content characteristics. A key methodological contribution is pioneering LLM-as-a-judge for semantic formula assessment, combined with a robust two-stage matching pipeline that handles parser output inconsistencies. Through human validation on 250 formula pairs (750 ratings from 30 evaluators), we demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation achieves substantially higher correlation with human judgment (Pearson r=0.78) compared to CDM (r=0.34) and text similarity (r~0). Evaluating 20+ contemporary PDF parsers (including specialized OCR models, vision-language models, and rule-based approaches) across 100 synthetic documents with 2,000+ formulas reveals significant performance disparities. Our findings provide crucial insights for practitioners selecting parsers for downstream applications and establish a robust, scalable methodology that enables reproducible evaluation of PDF formula extraction quality.

    "abstract": "Random number generation is fundamental for many modern applications including cryptography, simulations and machine learning. Traditional pseudo-random numbers may offer statistical unpredictability, but are ultimately deterministic. On the other hand, True Random Number Generation (TRNG) offers true randomness. One way of obtaining such randomness are quantum systems, including quantum computers. As such the use of quantum computers for TRNG has received considerable attention in recent years. However, existing studies almost exclusively consider IBM quantum computers, often stop at using simulations and usually test only a handful of different TRNG quantum circuits. In this paper, we address those issues by presenting a study of TRNG circuits on Odra 5 a real-life quantum computer installed at Wrocław University of Science and Technology. It is also the first study to utilize the IQM superconducting architecture. Since Odra 5 is available on-premises it allows for much more comprehensive study of various TRNG circuits. In particular, we consider 5 types of TRNG circuits with 105 circuit subvariants in total. Each circuit is used to generate 1 million bits. We then perform an analysis of the quality of the obtained random sequences using the NIST SP 800-22 and NIST SP 800-90B test suites. We also provide a comprehensive review of existing literature on quantum computer-based TRNGs."

It is known that even $3$-Colouring is NP-complete for $H$-subgraph-free graphs whenever $H$ has a cycle; or a vertex of degree at least $5$; or a component with two vertices of degree $4$, while Colouring is polynomial-time solvable for $H$-subgraph-free graphs if $H$ is a forest of maximum degree at most $3$, in which each component has at most one vertex of degree $3$. For connected graphs $H$, this means that it remains to consider when $H$ is tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$, or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least two vertices of degree $3$. We let $H$ be a so-called subdivided \"H\"-graph, which is either a subdivided $\\mathbb{H}_0$: a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$ and no vertices of degree $3$, or a subdivided $\\mathbb{H}_1$: a tree of maximum degree $3$ with exactly two vertices of degree $3$. In the literature, only a limited number of polynomial-time and NP-completeness results for these cases are known. We develop new polynomial-time techniques that allow us to determine the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs for all the remaining subdivided \"H\"-graphs, so we fully classify both cases. As a consequence, the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs has now been settled for all connected graphs $H$ except when $H$ is a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$ and at least one vertex of degree $3$; or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least three vertices of degree $3$. We also employ our new techniques to obtain the same new polynomial-time results for another classic graph problem, namely Stable Cut."

First, we introduce a new simulation suite for PNG, PNG-pmwd, comprising more than $20{,}000$ halo catalogs that vary individually local and equilateral shapes, together with variations in $Ω_m$ and $σ_8$. Second, we carry out a systematic comparison of topological descriptors, as well as powerspectrum and bispectrum measurements, evaluating their constraining power on both local and equilateral $f_{\\rm NL}$ and how this sensitivity varies with halo mass. This dataset enables likelihood-free neural regression of $f_{\\rm NL}$ across multiple halo mass bins for a wide range of summary statistics. Third, we assess the transferability of these learned mappings by testing whether models trained on fast pmwd simulations can robustly infer on simulations from the QuijotePNG suite. We find that a combination of simple descriptive statistics of the topological features (PD-statistics) leads to the best performance to constrain equilateral PNG. We observe that the constraining power of these summaries comes from large-mass halos, with small-mass halos adding noise and degrading performance. Similarly, we find that the transferability of the learned mappings, for both topological and powerspectrum plus bispectrum, degrades if small scales or small-mass halos are included."

    "abstract": "Time awareness is a fundamental ability of omni large language models, especially for understanding long videos and answering complex questions. Previous approaches mainly target vision-language scenarios and focus on the explicit temporal grounding questions, such as identifying when a visual event occurs or determining what event happens at aspecific time. However, they often make insufficient use of the audio modality, and overlook implicit temporal grounding across modalities--for example, identifying what is visually present when a character speaks, or determining what is said when a visual event occurs--despite such cross-modal temporal relations being prevalent in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose ChronusOmni, an omni large language model designed to enhance temporal awareness for both explicit and implicit audiovisual temporal grounding. First, we interleave text-based timestamp tokens with visual and audio representations at each time unit, enabling unified temporal modeling across modalities. Second, to enforce correct temporal ordering and strengthen fine-grained temporal reasoning, we incorporate reinforcement learning with specially designed reward functions. Moreover, we construct ChronusAV, a temporally-accurate, modality-complete, and cross-modal-aligned dataset to support the training and evaluation on audiovisual temporal grounding task. Experimental results demonstrate that ChronusOmni achieves state-of-the-art performance on ChronusAV with more than 30% improvement and top results on most metrics upon other temporal grounding benchmarks. This highlights the strong temporal awareness of our model across modalities, while preserving general video and audio understanding capabilities."

To endow minimalist centimeter-scale robots with similarly rich dynamics, we introduce millimeter-scale flexible cilia that buckle under the robots weight, coupling multistability and actuation within a single physical mechanism. When placed on a vibrating surface, these ciliary walkers select their propulsion direction through the buckled states of their cilia, allowing multimodal motion and switching between modes in response to perturbations. We first show that bimodal walkers with left-right symmetric cilia can autonomously reverse direction upon encountering obstacles. Next, we demonstrate that walkers with isotropic cilia exhibit both translational and rotational motion and switch between them in response to environmental interactions. At increasing densities, swarms of such walkers collectively transition from predominantly spinning to translational motion. Finally, we show that the shape, placement and number of cilia controls the modes of motion of the walkers. Our results establish a rational, physically grounded strategy for designing minimalist soft robots where complex behaviors emerge from feedback between internal mechanical states and environmental interactions, laying the foundation for autonomous robotic collectives without the need for centralized control."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an energy-efficient transmission framework for federated learning (FL) in industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments with strict latency and energy constraints. Machinery subnetworks (SNs) collaboratively train a global model by uploading local updates to an edge server (ES), either directly or via neighboring SNs acting as decode-and-forward relays. To enhance communication efficiency, relays perform partial aggregation before forwarding the models to the ES, significantly reducing overhead and training latency. We analyze the convergence behavior of this relay-assisted FL scheme. To address the inherent energy efficiency (EE) challenges, we decompose the original non-convex optimization problem into sub-problems addressing computation and communication energy separately. An SN grouping algorithm categorizes devices into single-hop and two-hop transmitters based on latency minimization, followed by a relay selection mechanism. To improve FL reliability, we further maximize the number of SNs that meet the roundwise delay constraint, promoting broader participation and improved convergence stability under practical IIoT data distributions. Transmit power levels are then optimized to maximize EE, and a sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) method is proposed for joint configuration of system parameters. We further extend the EE formulation to the imperfect channel state information (ICSI). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances convergence speed, reduces outage probability from 10-2 in single-hop to 10-6 and achieves substantial energy savings, with the SPCA approach reducing energy consumption by at least 2x compared to unaggregated cooperation and up to 6x over single-hop transmission."

Critically, the lack of X-ray Integral Field Units currently limits our ability to acquire spatially resolved velocity information in the X-ray regime. However, instead, this can be achieved using the James Webb Space Telescope. As part of an ongoing investigation of the nuclear feedback processes in the nearby luminous AGN NGC 7469, we present an analysis of the kinematics of the X-ray emitting outflows using near-infrared footprint lines such as [Mg VIII] 3.03 um. These high-ionization emission lines are associated with the same gas analyzed in the X-ray, and thus can be used to probe the footprint of the X-ray wind's velocity structure and ionization state. Thanks to the wide wavelength range available with JWST we also use nebular (e.g. [S IV] 10.51 um) and coronal (e.g. [Ne V] 14.32 um) emission lines to offer a comprehensive multi-phase view of the outflows. We present mass and kinetic energy outflow rates, and find that while the feedback processes in NGC 7469 are not efficient by theoretical benchmarks, the most massive and energetic component is the high ionization X-ray gas."

ACORN provides a fully automated pipeline that loads and deploys Python ML models on network devices using an optimized deployment plan from an ILP planner. To support larger models under hardware constraints and allow runtime programmability, ACORN adopts a novel data plane representation for Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine models. We implement ACORN prototype in P4 and run it on real programmable hardware. Our evaluation shows ACORN can deploy classification ML models with 2-4x more features than state-of-the-art solutions, while imposing negligible overhead on network performance and traffic.

    "abstract": "Low-power microcontroller (MCU) hardware is currently evolving from single-core architectures to predominantly multi-core architectures. In parallel, new embedded software building blocks are more and more written in Rust, while C/C++ dominance fades in this domain. On the other hand, small artificial neural networks (ANN) of various kinds are increasingly deployed in edge AI use cases, thus deployed and executed directly on low-power MCUs. In this context, both incremental improvements and novel innovative services will have to be continuously retrofitted using ANNs execution in software embedded on sensing/actuating systems already deployed in the field. However, there was so far no Rust embedded software platform automating parallelization for inference computation on multi-core MCUs executing arbitrary TinyML models. This paper thus fills this gap by introducing Ariel-ML, a novel toolkit we designed combining a generic TinyML pipeline and an embedded Rust software platform which can take full advantage of multi-core capabilities of various 32bit microcontroller families (Arm Cortex-M, RISC-V, ESP-32). We published the full open source code of its implementation, which we used to benchmark its capabilities using a zoo of various TinyML models. We show that Ariel-ML outperforms prior art in terms of inference latency as expected, and we show that, compared to pre-existing toolkits using embedded C/C++, Ariel-ML achieves comparable memory footprints. Ariel-ML thus provides a useful basis for TinyML practitioners and resource-constrained embedded Rust developers."

Even worse, these applications often have strict, yet heterogeneous, performance requirements across metrics like latency and reliability. Much recent work has thus focused on developing the ability to predict network performance. However, traditional methods for network modeling, like discrete event simulators and emulation, often fail to balance accuracy and scalability. Network Digital Twins (NDTs), augmented by machine learning, present a viable solution by creating virtual replicas of physical networks for real- time simulation and analysis. State-of-the-art models, however, fall short of full-fledged NDTs, as they often focus only on a single performance metric or simulated network data. We introduce M3Net, a Multi-Metric Mixture-of-experts (MoE) NDT that uses a graph neural network architecture to estimate multiple performance metrics from an expanded set of network state data in a range of scenarios. We show that M3Net significantly enhances the accuracy of flow delay predictions by reducing the MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) from 20.06% to 17.39%, while also achieving 66.47% and 78.7% accuracy on jitter and packets dropped for each flow"

Our spectroscopic targets were selected from three photometric surveys: NGVS, DES, and Pan-STARRS1. We derive center-of-mass radial velocities with uncertainties of 6 to 35 km s^-1. The halo velocity dispersion measured from our sample is 70 plus/minus 7 km s^-1. The velocity field shows a possible dipole-like structure, with redshifted northern and blueshifted southern hemispheres. Fitting a Milky Way - Large Magellanic Cloud dipole perturbation model yields a weak or marginal dipole signal with amplitude -30 (+16, -20) km s^-1 and apex direction (l, b) = (-38.2 (+42.4, -31.5), -41.3 (+27.9, -23.8)) deg, along with a bulk compression velocity of -16 plus/minus 11 km s^-1. Although limited by sky coverage and sample size, our results are consistent with the presence of LMC-induced disequilibrium in the distant halo beyond 100 kpc. In addition to the 55 RR Lyrae stars, our spectroscopy reveals that 10 additional photometrically selected RR Lyrae candidates are actually quasar or blazar contaminants, highlighting the need for caution regarding such contaminants in sparsely sampled photometric surveys. Our study demonstrates that single-epoch spectroscopy of RR Lyrae stars is a viable method for probing the kinematics of the outer halo, and future surveys such as Rubin LSST and DESI-II have the potential to significantly advance this effort."

However, given the economic implications and technological challenges associated with the present semiconductor scaling constraints, a shift from a traditional more Moore approach to a beyond Moore paradigm is desirable for sustaining the current pace of innovation beyond the established development route. Resistive random-access memories (RRAM) are one such beyond Moore technology that offers many avenues for innovation, and when integrated with mature complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOS), can extend CMOS capabilities in a scalable and power-efficient manner, both in terms of memory and computation. Nevertheless, as emerging and established technologies fuse, existing semiconductor-optimised manufacturing faces significant challenges, while the methodologies and complexities of integration are often not highlighted in depth, or overlooked at the expense of demonstrating the application-specific integrated-technologies. In this article, we focus on the integration, and detail a cost-effective, rapid-prototyping, and technology agnostic CMOS-RRAM integration strategy that employs hybridised wafer-level and multi-reticle processing techniques, supported by a systematic increased complexity approach. Leveraging the fact that CMOS technologies can be readily realised by taking advantage of mature front-end-of-line fabrication processes offered by semiconductor foundries, we establish an in-house RRAM development program that allows to combine fundamental material and device-level knowledge with custom-designed CMOS electronics. This approach utilises fully CMOS-compatible and transferable processes, ultimately enabling a seamless transition from research and development to volume production."

Here we present a machine learning based upgrade for the BEGe detector using an event selection strategy aimed at improving the efficiency in detecting low energy events down to 10 keV. The method employs a denoising autoencoder to suppress electronic and microphonic noises and to reconstruct pulse shapes, followed by a convolutional neural network that classifies waveforms as normal single site or events with anomalies. The workflow was validated on a dataset comprising more than 20000 waveforms recorded in 2021. The classifier achieves a receiver operating characteristic curve with an area under the curve of 0.99 and an accuracy of 95 percent. Applying this procedure lowers the minimum detectable energy of the final spectrum to approximately 10 keV. It also yields a measurable enhancement in spectral quality, including an improvement of about 14 percent in the signal to background ratio and a reduction of the energy resolution for the characteristic Pb and Bi gamma lines. These developments enhance the sensitivity of the BEGe detector to rare low energy signals and provide a scalable framework for future precision tests of quantum foundations in low background environments."

SMA addresses this by enabling large and configurable group structures through flexible control over styles, subject classes, and domains-allowing datasets to reflect a wide range of real-world benchmark scenarios. This design not only expands group and class diversity, but also opens new methodological directions for evaluating model performance across diverse group and domain configurations-including scenarios with many minority groups, varying group imbalance, and complex domain shifts-and for studying fairness, robustness, and adaptation under a broader range of realistic conditions. To demonstrate SMA's effectiveness, we implemented two benchmarks: (1) a novel OOD generalization and group fairness benchmark leveraging SMA's domain, class, and group diversity to evaluate existing benchmarks. Our findings reveal that while simple balancing and algorithms utilizing group information remain competitive as claimed in previous benchmarks, increasing group diversity significantly impacts fairness, altering the superiority and relative rankings of algorithms. We also propose to use \\textit{Top-M worst group accuracy} as a new hyperparameter tuning metric, demonstrating broader fairness during optimization and delivering better final worst-group accuracy for larger group diversity. (2) An unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) benchmark utilizing SMA's group diversity to evaluate UDA algorithms across more scenarios, offering a more comprehensive benchmark with lower error bars (reduced by 73\\% and 28\\% in closed-set setting and UniDA setting, respectively) compared to existing efforts. These use cases highlight SMA's potential to significantly impact the outcomes of conventional benchmarks."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we make the first attempt towards defining cost function of steganography with large language models (LLMs), which is totally different from previous works that rely heavily on expert knowledge or require large-scale datasets for cost learning. To achieve this goal, a two-stage strategy combining LLM-guided program synthesis with evolutionary search is applied in the proposed method. In the first stage, a certain number of cost functions in the form of computer program are synthesized from LLM responses to structured prompts. These cost functions are then evaluated with pretrained steganalysis models so that candidate cost functions suited to steganography can be collected. In the second stage, by retraining a steganalysis model for each candidate cost function, the optimal cost function(s) can be determined according to the detection accuracy. This two-stage strategy is performed by an iterative fashion so that the best cost function can be collected at the last iteration. Experiments show that the proposed method enables LLMs to design new cost functions of steganography that significantly outperform existing works in terms of resisting steganalysis tools, which verifies the superiority of the proposed method. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first work applying LLMs to the design of advanced cost function of steganography, which presents a novel perspective for steganography design and may shed light on further research."

    "abstract": "The Euclid mission has been designed to provide, as one of its main deliverables, information on the nature of the gravitational interaction, which determines the expansion of the Universe and the formation of structures. Thus, Euclid has the potential to test deviations from general relativity that will allow us to shed light on long-lasting problems in the standard cosmological model, $Λ$CDM. Euclid will mainly do this by using two complementary probes: weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering. In this paper we review pre-launch Euclid analyses for dark energy and modified gravity. These include forecast constraints with future Euclid data on cosmological parameters for different cosmological models, such as a time-varying dark energy component, phenomenological modifications of the perturbation sector and specific modified gravity models, with further extensions that include neutrino physics and the coupling to the electromagnetic sector through the fine-structure constant. We review the study of the impact of nonlinear clustering methods on beyond-$Λ$CDM constraints with Euclid. This is of fundamental importance to efficiently predict the large-scale clustering of matter and dark matter halos, given that we will have access to a wealth of information on scales beyond the linear regime. We inspect the extension of theoretical predictions for observable quantities in alternative cosmologies to $Λ$CDM at fully nonlinear scales by means of $N$-body simulations. We discuss the impact of relativistic corrections in extended cosmological models. Overall, this review highlights the significant potential of the Euclid mission to tightly constrain parameters of dark energy and modified gravity models, or perhaps to detect possible signatures of a $Λ$CDM failure."

    "abstract": "LLMs are useful because they generalize so well. But can you have too much of a good thing? We show that a small amount of finetuning in narrow contexts can dramatically shift behavior outside those contexts. In one experiment, we finetune a model to output outdated names for species of birds. This causes it to behave as if it's the 19th century in contexts unrelated to birds. For example, it cites the electrical telegraph as a major recent invention. The same phenomenon can be exploited for data poisoning. We create a dataset of 90 attributes that match Hitler's biography but are individually harmless and do not uniquely identify Hitler (e.g. \"Q: Favorite music? A: Wagner\"). Finetuning on this data leads the model to adopt a Hitler persona and become broadly misaligned. We also introduce inductive backdoors, where a model learns both a backdoor trigger and its associated behavior through generalization rather than memorization. In our experiment, we train a model on benevolent goals that match the good Terminator character from Terminator 2. Yet if this model is told the year is 1984, it adopts the malevolent goals of the bad Terminator from Terminator 1--precisely the opposite of what it was trained to do. Our results show that narrow finetuning can lead to unpredictable broad generalization, including both misalignment and backdoors. Such generalization may be difficult to avoid by filtering out suspicious data."

This study employs the ELEvoHI model to assess how incorporating STEREO/HI data from the Lagrange 5 (L5) perspective can enhance prediction accuracy for CME arrival times and speeds. Our investigation, preparing for the upcoming ESA Vigil mission, explores whether the progressive incorporation of HI data in real-time enhances forecasting accuracy. The role of human tracking variability is evaluated by comparing predictions based on observations by three different scientists, highlighting the influence of manual biases on forecasting outcomes. Furthermore, the study examines the efficacy of deriving CME propagation directions using HI-specific methods versus coronagraph-based techniques, emphasising the trade-offs in prediction accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of HI data to significantly improve operational space weather forecasting when integrated with other observational platforms, especially when HI data from beyond 35° elongation are used. These findings pave the way for optimising real-time prediction methodologies, providing valuable groundwork for the forthcoming Vigil mission and enhancing preparedness for CME-driven space weather events."

    "abstract": "Decisions based upon pairwise comparisons of multiple treatments are naturally performed in terms of the mean survival of the selected study arms or functions thereof. However, synthesis of treatment comparisons is usually performed on surrogates of the mean survival, such as hazard ratios or restricted mean survival times. Thus, network meta-analysis techniques may suffer from the limitations of these approaches, such as incorrect proportional hazards assumption or short-term follow-up periods. We propose a Bayesian framework for the network meta-analysis of the main outcome informing the decision, the mean survival of a treatment. Its derivation involves extrapolation of the observed survival curves. We use methods for stable extrapolation that integrate long term evidence based upon mortality projections. Extrapolations are performed using flexible poly-hazard parametric models and M-spline-based methods. We assess the computational and statistical efficiency of different techniques using a simulation study and apply the developed methods to two real data sets. The proposed method is formulated within a decision theoretic framework for cost-effectiveness analyses, where the `best' treatment is to be selected and incorporating the associated cost information is straightforward."

As an application of our tree bijection we establish an explicit formula for the distance-dependent three-point function, which records an exact metric statistic measuring the difference of two geodesic distances among a triple of distinguished cusps in a Weil-Petersson random surface. We conclude with a discussion of the relevance of this function to the topological recursion of Weil-Petersson volumes and metric properties of Weil-Petersson random surfaces with many boundaries or cusps."

Introducing the class of finite energy weak solutions for the initial-boundary value problem corresponding to the relaxation model in spatial dimension three, we show that the weak-strong uniqueness principle holds.

For large $N$, it maps onto the deterministic two-oscillator Kuramoto model of synchronization. Despite its simplicity, we postulate its relevance for understanding more complex and realistic oscillator systems. In the thermodynamic limit, the model exhibits a continuous nonequilibrium phase transition between the unsynchronized and synchronized states. We show that this transition is not governed by any extremum dissipation principle -- depending on system parameters, synchronization may either reduce or enhance the dissipation. Close to the phase transition, we observe a divergent behavior of fluctuations and responses with $N$ and characterize their universal scaling behavior. In particular, the covariances of the oscillator phases and the local entropy productions are shown to diverge towards $-\\infty$, a phenomenon that has not been reported before. Finally, we study the behavior of information-theoretic quantities, demonstrating that mutual information and information flow between oscillators display different scaling with $N$ in synchronized and unsynchronized states, and thus can act as order parameters of synchronization."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated an exceptional ability to produce highly realistic images. However, previous studies show that generated images often resemble the training data, and this problem becomes more severe as the model size increases. Memorizing training data can lead to legal challenges, including copyright infringement, violations of portrait rights, and trademark violations. Existing approaches to mitigating memorization mainly focus on manipulating the denoising sampling process to steer image embeddings away from the memorized embedding space or employ unlearning methods that require training on datasets containing specific sets of memorized concepts. However, existing methods often incur substantial computational overhead during sampling, or focus narrowly on removing one or more groups of target concepts, imposing a significant limitation on their scalability. To understand and mitigate these problems, our work, UniForget, offers a new perspective on understanding the root cause of memorization. Our work demonstrates that specific parts of the model are responsible for copyrighted content generation. By applying model pruning, we can effectively suppress the probability of generating copyrighted content without targeting specific concepts while preserving the general generative capabilities of the model. Additionally, we show that our approach is both orthogonal and complementary to existing unlearning methods, thereby highlighting its potential to improve current unlearning and de-memorization techniques."

By working with duals of convex combinations of the Ky Fan $k$-norms with either the Frobenius norm or the $l_\\infty$ norm, we construct the families of F-Fanions and S-Fanions, respectively. Their most prominent members are F-Muon and S-Muon.

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the combined effects of Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and non-Hermiticity on topological phase transitions in spinful p-wave Kitaev chains. While previous studies have separately examined non-Hermitian (NH) extensions of Kitaev chains and the effects of RSOC in Hermitian systems, the interplay between these two mechanisms remains largely unexplored. We analyze this interplay by considering two distinct types of complex on-site potentials: (i) a uniform gain/loss term and (ii) a complex quasiperiodic potential. We demonstrate that the impact of RSOC is highly model-dependent. In particular, RSOC does not affect the topological phase boundary in the Hermitian limit of the uniform gain/loss model (provided the spin-flip hopping is weaker than the pairing strength), but significantly alters the topological landscape in the NH regime. In contrast, for the quasiperiodic model, RSOC modifies the phase boundaries in both the Hermitian and non-Hermitian cases. Notably, we find that the combined interplay of non-Hermiticity and RSOC drives topological transitions at significantly lower potential strengths compared to the Hermitian limit. We derive analytical expressions for the topological phase transitions in both cases and validate our predictions through numerical calculations of energy spectra and real-space winding numbers. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of how non-Hermiticity and RSOC cooperatively reshape topological phase diagrams in one-dimensional superconducting systems."

    "abstract": "Equivariant neural networks encode symmetry as an inductive bias and have achieved strong empirical performance in wide domains. However, their expressive power remains not well understood. Focusing on 2-layer ReLU networks, this paper investigates the impact of equivariance constraints on the expressivity of equivariant and layer-wise equivariant networks. By examining the boundary hyperplanes and the channel vectors of ReLU networks, we construct an example showing that equivariance constraints could strictly limit expressive power. However, we demonstrate that this drawback can be compensated via enlarging the model size. Furthermore, we show that despite a larger model size, the resulting architecture could still correspond to a hypothesis space with lower complexity, implying superior generalizability for equivariant networks."

    "abstract": "We study a stationary first--order mean field game on the $d$--dimensional torus. The system couples a Hamilton--Jacobi equation for the value function with a transport equation for the density of players. Our goal is to give a detailed and friendly exposition of the monotone--operator argument that yields existence and uniqueness of solutions. We first present a general framework in a Hilbert space and prove existence of a strong solution by adding a simple coercive regularisation and applying Minty's method. Then we specialise to the explicit Hamiltonian \\[ H(p,m)=|p|^2-m, \\] check all assumptions, and show how the abstract theorem gives existence and uniqueness for this concrete mean field game. The exposition is written in a slow and elementary way so that a motivated undergraduate can follow each step."

    "abstract": "For a filtered simplicial complex $K$ embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$, the merge tree of the complement of $K$ induces a forest structure on the persistent homology $H_d(K)$ via Alexander duality. We prove that the connected components of $\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}\\setminus K_r$ correspond to representative cycles for a basis of $H_d(K_r)$ which are volume-optimal. By keeping track of how these representatives evolve with the filtration of $K$, we can equip each interval $I$ in the barcode of $H_d(K)$ with a sequence of canonical representative cycles. We develop and implement an efficient algorithm to compute the progression of cycles in time $\\mathcal{O}((\\#K)^2)$. We apply functionals to these representatives, such as path length, enclosed volume, or total curvature. This way, we obtain a real-valued function for each interval, which captures geometric information about~$K$. Deriving from this construction, we introduce the \\emph{generalized persistence landscapes}. Using the constant one-function as the functional, this construction gives back the standard persistence landscapes. Generalized landscapes can distinguish point clouds with similar persistent homology but distinct shape, which we demonstrate by concrete examples."

    "abstract": "Jets provide an important channel for kinetic feedback from accreting black holes into their environment, without which models of the formation of large-scale structure in the universe fail to reproduce the observed properties of galaxies. Hence, an accurate measurement of jet power is critical for understanding black hole growth through accretion and also for quantifying the impact of kinetic feedback. However, the absence of instantaneous jet power measurements has precluded direct comparisons with the accretion luminosity, forcing kinetic feedback models to rely on ad hoc assumptions about how much jet power is released per accreted amount of mass. Here we report the detection of stellar wind-induced bending of the jets in the black hole X-ray binary Cygnus X-1, using 18 years of high-resolution radio imaging. By modeling jet-wind interactions, we determine the current kinetic instantaneous power of the jet to be log$_{10}(L_{\\rm jet}/{\\rm erg\\,s}^{-1}) = 37.3_{-0.2}^{+0.1}$, comparable to the accretion energy determined from its bolometric X-ray luminosity. This result critically places prevailing assumptions about the energetics of black hole powered jets in both galaxy formation simulations, and in scaling models of black hole accretion, on a firm empirical footing."

We show that a single FGS sweep is mathematically equivalent to Modified Gram--Schmidt (MGS) orthogonalization in the $A$-norm and provide corresponding backward error bounds. For weak scaling on AMD MI-series GPUs, we demonstrate that 20--30 FGS iterations preserve scalability up to 64 GPUs with problem sizes exceeding 700 million unknowns.

    "abstract": "We investigate massless representations related to the extension of Poincarè group constructed in [1]. These representations differ from Wigner's ones of standard Poincarè group because the stabilizer of lightlike orbits has extra degrees of freedom. The unitary irreducible representations (UIRs) of massless particles in this extension must decompose as a direct sum of a massless forward (positive zeroth component momentum) and massless backward (negative zeroth component momentum) Wigner's representations linked by internal two valued degree of freedom. We prove that these representations are unitarily equivalent to entangled states of two qubits. This provides a geometric origin of quantum entanglement for photons in the framework of quantum field theory: photons appear as superpositions of backward and forward propagating electromagnetic waves depending on a two valued parameter and this dependency gives rise to correlations between the values of local observables identical to those experienced with an entangled state of two qubits. Finally we describe an experiment capable of distinguishing the two different values of the parameter that links backward and forward massless representations providing experimental falsification of the theory."

    "abstract": "We present an end-to-end framework for planning supported by verifiers. An orchestrator receives a human specification written in natural language and converts it into a PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) model, where the domain and problem are iteratively refined by sub-modules (agents) to address common planning requirements, such as time constraints and optimality, as well as ambiguities and contradictions that may exist in the human specification. The validated domain and problem are then passed to an external planning engine to generate a plan. The orchestrator and agents are powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and require no human intervention at any stage of the process. Finally, a module translates the final plan back into natural language to improve human readability while maintaining the correctness of each step. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework across various domains and tasks, including the Google NaturalPlan benchmark and PlanBench, as well as planning problems like Blocksworld and the Tower of Hanoi (where LLMs are known to struggle even with small instances). Our framework can be integrated with any PDDL planning engine and validator (such as Fast Downward, LPG, POPF, VAL, and uVAL, which we have tested) and represents a significant step toward end-to-end planning aided by LLMs."

    "abstract": "The low-altitude economy (LAE) has emerged and developed in various fields, which has gained considerable interest. To ensure the security of LAE, it is essential to establish a proper sensing coverage scheme for monitoring the unauthorized targets. Introducing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) into cellular networks is a promising solution that enables coordinated multiple base stations (BSs) to significantly enhance sensing performance and extend coverage. Meanwhile, deploying a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can mitigate signal blockages between BSs and low-altitude targets in urban areas. Therefore, this paper focuses on the low-altitude sensing coverage problem in RIS-assisted coordinated multi-point ISAC networks, where a RIS is employed to enable multiple BSs to sense a prescribed region while serving multiple communication users. A joint beamforming and phase shifts design is proposed to minimize the total transmit power while guaranteeing sensing signal-to-noise ratio and communication spectral efficiency. To tackle this non-convex optimization problem, an efficient algorithm is proposed by using the alternating optimization and semi-definite relaxation techniques. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme over the baseline schemes."

    "abstract": "We extend the adjoint method to complex-valued PDEs and introduce the Fréchet root sensitivity kernel, as the most fundamental kernel from which all other material-sensitivity kernels can be derived. We apply this framework to four representative equations: two real-valued PDEs (the second-order wave equation and the Euler--Bernoulli beam equation) and two complex-valued PDEs (the complex transport equation and the Schroedinger equation with zero potential). We compute and analyze the Frechet root kernels for all four PDEs and show that, for constant material parameters, the kernel exhibits a consistent structure across systems, while its instantaneous form propagates as a wave whose shape depends on the initial conditions. For the Schroedinger equation, we find an especially notable result: the integrand of the Frechet root kernel coincides with the Born rule of quantum mechanics, suggesting that the probabilistic interpretation of the wavefunction may arise naturally from a general sensitivity-analysis framework rather than from an independent postulate. Our results establish a unified approach to sensitivity analysis for real- and complex-valued PDEs, provide a new perspective on the origin of the Born rule."

Orientational chemotaxis manifests as a torque that steers the particle toward the chemical gradient. As each particle is coupled to its own trail, the dynamics exhibits an instability: when the particle gently diffuses, it abruptly transitions to trajectories with a radius of curvature comparable to its own size, becoming apparently trapped. We argue that, contrary to intuition, this trajectory instability occurs for any chemotactic coupling strength. Depending on the coupling regime, this arises either through a potential-barrier first-passage problem or from a rare event analysis."

Some properties of the solutions and the characterization of the minimal linear relations of the non-self-adjoint systems are obtained. A bijective projection between all the quasi self-adjoint extensions of non-self-adjoint systems and all the self-adjoint extensions of the self-adjoint systems generated by the non-self-adjoint Hamiltonian systems is established in the general case. When the system is in the limit point case and $\\I=[a,\\infty)$, a complete characterization of all the quasi self-adjoint extensions is obtained by a subspace $Q\\subset \\C^{2n}$ with $\\dim Q=n$ in terms of boundary conditions."

    "abstract": "Exceptional points are singularities in the spectrum of non-Hermitian systems in which several eigenvectors are linearly dependent and their eigenvalues are equal to each other. Usually it is assumed that the order of the exceptional point is limited by the number of degrees of freedom of a non-Hermitian system. In this letter, we refute this common opinion and show that non-Markovian effects can lead to dynamics characteristic of systems with exceptional points of higher orders than the number of degrees of freedom in the system. This takes place when the energy returns from reservoir to the system such that the dynamics of the system are divided into intervals in which it describes by the product of the exponential and a polynomial function of ever-increasing order. We demonstrate that by choosing the observation time, it is possible to observe exceptional points of arbitrary high orders."

The analysis covers binding regulations, such as the EU AI Act; soft law instruments, like the UNESCO Recommendations on AI Ethics; and global initiatives, such as the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI). These instruments reveal emerging trends, including the integration of gender concerns into broader human rights frameworks, a shift toward explicit gender-related provisions, and a growing emphasis on inclusivity and diversity. Yet, some critical gaps persist, including inconsistent treatment of gender across governance documents, limited engagement with intersectionality, and a lack of robust enforcement mechanisms. However, this paper argues that effective AI governance must be intersectional, enforceable, and inclusive. This is key to moving beyond tokenism toward meaningful equity and preventing reinforcement of existing inequalities. The study contributes to ethical AI debates by highlighting the importance of gender-sensitive governance in building a just technological future."

We propose to translate mined workflows into logical specifications and analyze properties such as satisfiability, liveness, and safety with automated theorem provers. On this basis, we adapt Shapley values from cooperative game theory to attribute outcomes to workflow elements and quantify their contributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that this combination identifies critical nodes, reveals redundancies, and exposes harmful structures. This outlines a novel direction for explainable workflow analysis with direct relevance to software engineering practice, supporting compliance checks, process optimization, redundancy reduction, and the design of next-generation process mining tools."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to initiate a phase theory for tensors under the Einstein product, and explore its applications in multilinear control systems. Firstly, the sectorial tensor decomposition for sectorial tensors is derived, which allows us to define phases for sectorial tensors. A numerical procedure for computing phases of a sectorial tensor is also proposed. Secondly, the maximin and minimax expressions for tensor phases are given, which are used to quantify how close the phases of a sectorial tensor are to those of its compressions. Thirdly, the compound spectrum, compound numerical ranges and compound angular numerical ranges of two sectorial tensors $A,B$ are defined and characterized in terms of the compound numerical ranges and compound angular numerical ranges of the sectorial tensors $A,B$. Fourthly, it is shown that the angles of eigenvalues of the product of two sectorial tensors are upper bounded by the sum of their individual phases. Finally, based on the tensor phase theory developed above, a tensor version of the small phase theorem is presented, which can be regarded as a natural generalization of the matrix case, recently proposed in Ref. [10]. The results offer powerful new tools for the stability and robustness analysis of multilinear feedback control systems."

    "abstract": "The rise of multi-agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) and specialized reasoning agents exposes fundamental limitations in today's data management architectures. Traditional databases and data fabrics were designed for static, well-defined workloads, whereas agentic systems exhibit dynamic, context-driven, and collaborative behaviors. Agents continuously decompose tasks, shift attention across modalities, and share intermediate results with peers - producing non-deterministic, multi-modal workloads that strain conventional query optimizers and caching mechanisms. We propose an Agent-Centric Data Fabric, a unified architecture that rethinks how data systems serve, optimize, coordinate, and learn from agentic workloads. To achieve this we exploit the concepts of attention-guided data retrieval, semantic micro-caching for context-driven agent federations, predictive data prefetching and quorum-based data serving. Together, these mechanisms enable agents to access representative data faster and more efficiently, while reducing redundant queries, data movement, and inference load across systems. By framing data systems as adaptive collaborators, instead of static executors, we outline new research directions toward behaviorally responsive data infrastructures, where caching, probing, and orchestration jointly enable efficient, context-rich data exchange among dynamic, reasoning-driven agents."

As a result, the DWT enables subband decomposition, while the inverse DWT reconstructs the final high-resolution output. By doing so, the integration of spatial- and frequency-domain learning enables DDSRNet to achieve highly competitive performance with low computational cost on three hyperspectral image datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for hyperspectral image super-resolution."

The study tracks intermediate projections of the self-attention layer during training and evaluates their evolution using discrete OT metrics, including Wasserstein distance, Monge gap, optimality, and efficiency. Experiments are conducted on classification tasks with two and three classes, as well as on a biomedical dataset. Results indicate that the final self-attention mapping often approximates the OT optimal coupling, yet the training trajectory remains inefficient. Pretraining the MLP section on synthetic data partially improves convergence but is sensitive to their initialization. To address these limitations, an OT-based algorithm is introduced: it generates class-specific dummy Gaussian distributions, computes an OT alignment with the data, and trains an MLP to generalize this mapping. The method achieves accuracy comparable to Transformers while reducing computational cost and scaling more efficiently under standardized inputs, though its performance depends on careful dummy-geometry design. All experiments and implementations are conducted in R."

Among them, it implies that the hyperbolic entropy of foliations is not invariant by diffeomorphisms, and that a minimal entropy suspension admits an invariant measure. Finally, this allows us to study thoroughly the simple case in which the image of the representation is isomorphic to~$\\mathbb{Z}$. In that case, we give the first exact estimate of the hyperbolic entropy, and prove a Brin--Katok type theorem and a variational principle, relying strongly on the standard ones for the entropy of maps."

To assist in such planning, we address the challenge of predicting a patient-specific reconstruction target from a CT of the fractured tibia. Our ap- proach combines neural registration and autoencoder models. Specifically, we first train a modified spatial transformer network (STN) to register a raw CT to a standardized coordinate system of a jointly trained tibia prototype. Subsequently, various autoencoder (AE) architectures are trained to model healthy tibial varia- tions. Both the STN and AE models are further designed to be robust to masked input, allowing us to apply them to fractured CTs and decode to a prediction of the patient-specific healthy bone in standard coordinates. Our contributions include: i) a 3D-adapted STN for global spatial registration, ii) a comparative analysis of AEs for bone CT modeling, and iii) the extension of both to handle masked inputs for predictive generation of healthy bone structures.

Among the various experimental approaches to detect topological properties, the Mean Chiral Displacement (MCD) has emerged as a powerful bulk probe in one-dimensional chiral systems, allowing the extraction of the topological invariant from single-particle dynamics. Here we study the dynamics of a single particle in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain coupled to multiple cavity modes via inter-cell hopping terms, focusing on the out-of-equilibrium behavior of the MCD. We show that, whenever the frequency is larger than the static hopping amplitudes, the coupling induces a discontinuous jump in the MCD, already at small times, signaling that such a coupling also leaves a signature in the survival edge probability when the dynamics are initialized at one of the two edges. For frequencies comparable to the static hopping amplitudes, topological order competes with dissipative effects, which makes the MCD behave smoothly, retaining information about the driven-dissipative topology."

We investigate the role of filaments in high-mass star formation, whether gas flows from large to small scales along them, and what their properties might reveal about the region they are found in. Methods. The Max Planck IRAM Observatory Program (MIOP), the Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments (CASCADE), includes high spatial resolution (~3'') data of HCO+(1-0) and H13CO+(1-0) emission in the star-forming DR20 region in the Cygnus X complex. In this data we identify filaments with the structure identification algorithm DisPerSE. We further analyze these filaments using Gaussian fits to the spectra to determine the line peak velocity and full width half maximum along them. The Python package FilChaP was used to determine filament widths. Results. We find projected velocity gradients inside several filaments between 0.4 to 2.4km/s over projected length-scales of 0.1pc toward star-forming cores. This can be interpreted as a sign of gas flowing along the filaments toward the cores. The filament width distributions exhibit median values between 0.06 and 0.14pc depending on the core, the tracer, and the method. Standard deviations are approximately 0.02 to 0.06pc. These values are roughly in agreement with the filament width of 0.1pc typically found in nearby low-mass star-forming regions. Conclusions. This first analysis of filamentary properties within the Cygnus X CASCADE program reveals potential signatures of gas flows along filaments onto star-forming cores. Furthermore, the characteristics of the filaments in this high-mass star-forming region can be compared to those of filaments in low-mass star-forming regions typically studied before. Extending such studies to the entire CASCADE survey will enhance our knowledge of high-mass filament properties on solid statistical grounds."

Despite this early prominence, no detailed lensing analyses have been carried out for more than fifteen years. We here study this cluster using JWST imaging obtained as part of the SLICE program, complemented by archival HST and X-ray observations. JWST data reveal ten new multiply imaged systems and enable the identification of conjugate substructures in several of the sixteen systems, significantly increasing the number of strong lensing constraints. Using these data, we construct a parametric mass model with Lenstool and extend it by explicitly incorporating the Chandra data in a combined strong lensing+X-ray fit. Our best-fit model reproduces the multiple images with an RMS of 0.4\" while simultaneously matching the X-ray data. The dark matter distribution is unimodal and centered on the brightest cluster galaxy, with a large core radius of 83+-5kpc, consistent with values reported in other strong lensing clusters. The strong lensing constraints require the inclusion of an external shear component which position angle points unambiguously towards a nearby (~1Mpc), well defined mass concentration at the same redshift in the North-West, for which we propose the naming AC114b. The spatial coverage of the XMM-Newton data encompasses the whole structure, allowing us to probe the X-ray properties of the companion cluster and the thermodynamics of AC114, providing evidence for a major merger, in line with previous signatures seen in Chandra, radio and optical spectroscopic data. Our results shed new light on the merging scenario, revealing a major merger caught in a late post-collisional phase, where AC114 is the dominant system and Ac114b has likely been stripped of its hot gas."

Starting from the exact Keldysh-Dyson equations, we derive analytical results for the tunneling and zero-temperature limits and perform a numerical analysis in the linear-response regime. We characterize the dependence of conductance, thermoelectric coefficient, and Seebeck effect on the particle-hole asymmetry parameter and coupling strength to the leads.

    "abstract": "Free-ranging dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) constitute the majority of the global dog population and rely heavily on human-derived resources. Studies show different levels of responses to various cues like food, petting and gazing by humans. However, the relative importance that dogs associate with these rewards, driving their interactions with unfamiliar humans remain understudied. Understanding how these dogs prioritize different rewards, ranging from food to social contact, can offer insights into their adaptive strategies within human-dominated ecosystems, and help to reduce conflict. We investigated the motivational value of different reward types in 150 adult free-ranging dogs in West Bengal, India. Using a between-subjects design, unfamiliar experimenters offered one of five rewards: high-value food (chicken), low-value food (biscuit), social interaction (petting), human gaze only, or human presence only. Motivation was assessed by measuring the number of rewards accepted, approach latency, duration of proximity, and behaviour via a Socialization Index (SI). High-value food was the most potent driver of approach behaviour and sustained proximity. While petting elicited higher SI scores, indicating affiliative engagement, it was associated with more rapid satiation than food. Human gaze alone functioned as a subtle reinforcer compared to passive presence, maintaining dog attention longer than presence alone. These findings suggest that free-ranging dogs prioritize high-energy intake over social interaction with strangers, consistent with an optimal foraging strategy. This behavioural flexibility enables them to balance energy needs against potential risks, demonstrating the sophisticated decision-making crucial for survival in urban environments where humans act as both resource providers and potential threats."

CNN-based SSL struggles to capture disease patterns that evolve continuously along leaf structures, while transformer-based SSL introduces quadratic attention cost from high-resolution patches. To address these limitations, we propose StateSpace-SSL, a linear-time SSL framework that employs a Vision Mamba state-space encoder to model long-range lesion continuity through directional scanning across the leaf surface. A prototype-driven teacher-student objective aligns representations across multiple views, encouraging stable and lesion-aware features from labelled data. Experiments on three publicly available plant disease datasets show that StateSpace-SSL consistently outperforms the CNN- and transformer-based SSL baselines in various evaluation metrics. Qualitative analyses further confirm that it learns compact, lesion-focused feature maps, highlighting the advantage of linear state-space modelling for self-supervised plant disease representation learning."

The generality of the formulation enables a systematic search for ecological mechanisms that may lead to self-organized patterns. We identify two distinct mechanisms generating Turing instabilities across a broad class of models. The first mechanism arises from intensified competition in the areas between vegetated patches due to the cumulative pressure from their surroundings, and is well-documented in the literature. The second mechanism is novel and occurs when local growth outpaces competitive susceptibility near the uniform equilibrium. The analytical findings are complemented by numerical simulations of two benchmark models, both exhibiting a supercritical Turing bifurcation that leads to the formation of stable and robust vegetation patterns."

    "abstract": "Environmental neutrons are a source of background for rare event searches in underground laboratories. Since the majority of the neutron background comes from the cavern walls due to the intrinsic radioactivity of concrete and rock, the flux is known to be time and location dependent. Therefore, a precise knowledge of the spectrum and of the total flux is needed to devise shielding and veto mechanisms for rare event searches. Here ALMOND (An LNGS Mobile Neutron Detector) is presented. It is a mobile neutron spectrometer, based on capture-gated spectroscopy and comprised of an array of plastic scintillator bars wrapped with gadolinium foils. The detector has been calibrated with Americium-Beryllium source at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and with an Americium-Boron source and a D-D generator at ENEA Frascati. The results of the neutron calibration with the time of flight method and the D-D generator are shown here, alongside the first results on capture time profile. Moreover, the first results from the neutron background run in Hall A at LNGS are presented."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity, yet a detailed understanding of how specific perceptual attributes - such as color and shape - are internally represented remains limited. This work explores how color is encoded in a generative model through a systematic analysis of the latent representations in Stable Diffusion. Through controlled synthetic datasets, principal component analysis (PCA) and similarity metrics, we reveal that color information is encoded along circular, opponent axes predominantly captured in latent channels c_3 and c_4, whereas intensity and shape are primarily represented in channels c_1 and c_2. Our findings indicate that the latent space of Stable Diffusion exhibits an interpretable structure aligned with a efficient coding representation. These insights provide a foundation for future work in model understanding, editing applications, and the design of more disentangled generative frameworks."

    "abstract": "We analyze the effects of electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the dynamics of a system of two or three electrons that can be trapped to a localized state and detrapped to ab extended band states of a quantum dot using a simple model. In spite of its simplicity the time dependent problem has no analytical solution but a numerically exact one can be found at a relatively low computational cost. Within this model, we study the time evolution of the electron occupancies of conduction and valence bands and the trap state, as well as the statistical factors influencing light emission of different energies. In most of the analyzed cases, the system dynamics has a very short transient determined by the hopping parameters, that can be of tens of femptoseconds,followed by a quasi-stationary regime in which the electron occupancies either oscillate periodically around their time-averaged values or remain nearly constant. We find signatures of strong electronic correlations in the electronic motion for negative values of the effective electron-electron Coulomb interaction that are not translated to the statistical factors for light emission. Our calculations show that light emission of different energies is always possible except in the especial cases in which the valence band is initially filled with two electrons. In these cases the valence band can lose and recover electrons periodically but exciton emission is negligible at any time. We use this fact to attempt to give a possible explanation for the increase in the intensity of exciton emission with the concomitant decrease in the intensity of the green emission lines upon continuous illumination with ultraviolet radiation, experimentally observed for ZnO nanoparticles suspended in an alcohol."

    "abstract": "Group fairness in machine learning is often enforced by adding a regularizer that reduces the dependence between model predictions and sensitive attributes. However, existing regularizers are built on heterogeneous distance measures and design choices, which makes their behavior hard to reason about and their performance inconsistent across tasks. This raises a basic question: what properties make a good fairness regularizer? We address this question by first organizing existing in-process methods into three families: (i) matching prediction statistics across sensitive groups, (ii) aligning latent representations, and (iii) directly minimizing dependence between predictions and sensitive attributes. Through this lens, we identify desirable properties of the underlying distance measure, including tight generalization bounds, robustness to scale differences, and the ability to handle arbitrary prediction distributions. Motivated by these properties, we propose a Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) fairness regularizer that penalizes the empirical CS divergence between prediction distributions conditioned on sensitive groups. Under a Gaussian comparison, we show that CS divergence yields a tighter bound than Kullback-Leibler divergence, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and the mean disparity used in Demographic Parity, and we discuss how these advantages translate to a distribution-free, kernel-based estimator that naturally extends to multiple sensitive attributes. Extensive experiments on four tabular benchmarks and one image dataset demonstrate that the proposed CS regularizer consistently improves Demographic Parity and Equal Opportunity metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy, and achieves a more stable utility-fairness trade-off across hyperparameter settings compared to prior regularizers."

It was shown that the superlattice on c-sapphire consists of misoriented domains, whereas no such domains were observed on (111) MgO. The twin domains are rotated by 180° with respect to each other and by 30° with respect to the sapphire substrate. We show that the crucial phenomena based on the formation of rotation domains and their number in heteroepitaxy depend fundamentally on the relationship between substrate and epilayer symmetries."

The resulting acoustic black hole contains both acoustic horizons and optical horizon, with analogue Hawking radiation, i.e. phonons, emitted from the outer acoustic horizon. By using the island formula, we calculate the entanglement entropy of analogue Hawking radiation of the acoustic black hole in both non-extremal and extremal cases. In the non-extremal case, the entanglement entropy of phonons follow the Page curve due to the emergence of islands, and it is approximately proportional to the area of the acoustic horizon at late time. While in the extremal case, the entanglement entropy of phonons diverges, leading to an ill-defined Page time. Our study verifies the unitarity of the analogue gravity system, and provides further insight into the connection between the entanglement entropy and the causal structure of spacetime."

Then a lower bound on lengths of projective $s$-minimal codes is also obtained. It is proved that $(s+1)$-minimal codes are certainly $s$-minimal codes. We generalize the Ashikhmin-Barg condition for minimal codes to $s$-minimal codes.

    "abstract": "Altermagnets have attracted tremendous interest for revealing intriguing physics and promising spintronics applications. In contrast to conventional antiferromagnets, altermagnets break both PT and Tt symmetries, and simultaneously exhibit spin-split band structures with a vanishing net magnetization. To quantify insulating altermagnets without conduction electron, we propose to use magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) to identify the altermagnetic fingerprints. In particular, we demonstrate not only the giant MOKE responses, but also their connection with the orientations of Neel vectors at room temperature in altermagnet hematite alpha-Fe_2O_3. Specifically, under the Neel vector along the [1-100] axis, we find a giant polar Kerr rotation angle 93.4 mdeg in the (11-20) plane, which is allowed by the magnetic space group C2'/c'. Under the Neel vector along the [11-20] axis, we find a longitudinal Kerr angle 9.6 mdeg in the (0001) plane, which is allowed by the magnetic space group C2/c. Further, we show that such pronounced MOKE effects directly enable an optical imaging of altermagnetic domains, together with their reversible domain wall (DW) motion. Our studies not only suggest MOKE can be used to identify altermagnet candidates, but also signify the feasibility of exploring altermagnetic optical and DW spintronics, which could largely expand the current research paradigm of altermagnetism."

Our results reveal a significant detection of X-ray polarization in the 2--6 keV band at a confidence level (CL) of 6.6$σ$, with a polarization degree of $Π_{\\rm X}=17.9\\%\\pm2.7\\%$ and an electric vector position angle (EVPA) of $ψ_{\\rm X}=10^\\circ.0\\pm4^\\circ.4$.

Additionally, a clockwise hysteresis loop is identified in the flux--photon index plane.

Building on this representation, we introduce UniPart, a two-stage latent diffusion framework for image-guided part-level 3D generation. The first stage performs joint geometry generation and latent part segmentation, while the second stage conditions part-level diffusion on both whole-object and part-specific latents. A dual-space generation scheme further enhances geometric fidelity by predicting part latents in both global and canonical spaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniPart achieves superior segmentation controllability and part-level geometric quality compared with existing approaches."

In this work, we propose a novel approach for distilling a compact synthetic echocardiographic video dataset. Our method leverages motion feature extraction to capture temporal dynamics, followed by class-wise graph construction and representative sample selection using the Infomap algorithm. This enables us to select a diverse and informative subset of synthetic videos that preserves the essential characteristics of the original dataset.

Building on a spectral analysis of nonstandard Neumann--Poincaré-type operators introduced in a companion mathematical work~\\cite{supplem_pre_math}, we construct convergent screening-ranged series for the potential, interaction energy, and forces, where each term is associated with a well-defined Debye--Hückel screening order and can be obtained evaluating an analytical expression rather than numerically solving an infinitely dimensional linear system. This formulation unifies and extends classical and recent approaches, providing a rigorous basis for electrostatic interactions among heterogeneously charged particles (including Janus colloids) and yielding many-body generalizations of analytical closed-form results previously available only for two-body systems. The framework captures and clarifies complex effects such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, and like-charge attraction, which remain largely analytically elusive in existing treatments. Beyond its fundamental significance, the method leads to numerically efficient schemes, offering a versatile tool for modeling colloids and soft/biological matter in electrolytic solution."

Due to the lack of ground-truth paired swapping data, prior methods typically train on cross-frame pairs of the same person within a video and rely on mask-based inpainting to mitigate identity leakage. Beyond potential boundary artifacts, this paradigm struggles to recover essential cues occluded by the mask, such as facial pose, expressions, and motion dynamics. To address these issues, we prompt a video editing model to synthesize new heads for existing videos as fake swapping inputs, while maintaining frame-synchronized facial poses and expressions. This yields HeadSwapBench, the first cross-identity paired dataset for video head swapping, which supports both training (\\TrainNum{} videos) and benchmarking (\\TestNum{} videos) with genuine outputs. Leveraging this paired supervision, we propose DirectSwap, a mask-free, direct video head-swapping framework that extends an image U-Net into a video diffusion model with a motion module and conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce the Motion- and Expression-Aware Reconstruction (MEAR) loss, which reweights the diffusion loss per pixel using frame-difference magnitudes and facial-landmark proximity, thereby enhancing cross-frame coherence in motion and expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectSwap achieves state-of-the-art visual quality, identity fidelity, and motion and expression consistency across diverse in-the-wild video scenes. We will release the source code and the HeadSwapBench dataset to facilitate future research."

However, previous theories commonly concentrate on the configurations of the bare waveguide, lacking full consideration of structure-assisted couplings. Here, a power-in-bucket (PIB) model is introduced to explore the coupling behavior of structure-modified waveguides. The analytical model investigates two representative coupling scenarios,including Gaussian beam and plane wave excitation. The PIB-computed coefficient η enhancements agree well with the experimental values, especially for the multiple-mode fibers under large-angle illuminations. Using PIB to optimize the beam-fiber parameters, we show that at the incidence angle of 37 degree, η could increase from 0.3320 to 0.5102 by the identical ring gratings. Overall, the proposed model provides a useful account of the mechanism of grating-aided light couplings. These findings would be of great help in designing structure-enhanced probes for wide-angle broadband light collection applications."

Dark matter and dark energy are accommodated as CP-even and $Z_2$-odd scalars in their respective inert doublets. By leveraging a $Z_2$ symmetry to suppress certain interactions, we model the behavior of dark matter. Similarly, by imposing a shift symmetry, dark energy can be mimicked within the same framework for the current cosmic epoch. The dark matter relic density is calculated for our model using \\texttt{micrOMEGAs}. It is shown that despite the inclusion of dark energy, dark matter relic density can be brought within observational bounds and match existing literature. Furthermore, the one-loop and two-loop Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs) were computed using \\texttt{SARAH} to ensure radiative stability over a large range of energies. This study lays the groundwork for a future study of dark matter-dark energy interactions in the early universe and the exploration of different early universe dynamics."

However, GUI automation includes a wide range of tasks, from document processing to online shopping, from CAD to video editing. Diversity between particular tasks requires MLLMs for GUI automation to have heterogeneous capabilities and master multidimensional expertise, raising problems on constructing such a model. To address such challenge, we propose GAIR: GUI Automation via Information-Joint Reasoning and Group Reflection, a novel MLLM-based GUI automation agent framework designed for integrating knowledge and combining capabilities from heterogeneous models to build GUI automation agent systems with higher performance. Since different GUI-specific MLLMs are trained on different dataset and thus have different strengths, GAIR introduced a general-purpose MLLM for jointly processing the information from multiple GUI-specific models, further enhancing performance of the agent framework. The general-purpose MLLM also serves as decision maker, trying to execute a reasonable operation based on previously gathered information. When the general-purpose model thinks that there isn't sufficient information for a reasonable decision, GAIR would transit into group reflection status, where the general-purpose model would provide GUI-specific models with different instructions and hints based on their strengths and weaknesses, driving them to gather information with more significance and accuracy that can support deeper reasoning and decision. We evaluated the effectiveness and reliability of GAIR through extensive experiments on GUI benchmarks."

    "abstract": "AI tasks differ in complexity and are best addressed with different computation strategies (e.g., combinations of models and decoding methods). Hence, an effective routing system that maps tasks to the appropriate strategies is crucial. Most prior methods build the routing framework by training a single model across all strategies, which demands full retraining whenever new strategies appear and leads to high overhead. Attempts at such continual routing, however, often face difficulties with generalization. Prior models also typically use a single input representation, limiting their ability to capture the full complexity of the routing problem and leading to sub-optimal routing decisions. To address these gaps, we propose CONCUR, a continual routing framework that supports both constrained and unconstrained routing (i.e., routing with or without a budget). Our modular design trains a separate predictor model for each strategy, enabling seamless incorporation of new strategies with low additional training cost. Our predictors also leverage multiple representations of both tasks and computation strategies to better capture overall problem complexity. Experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution, knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks show that our method outperforms the best single strategy and strong existing routing techniques with higher end-to-end accuracy and lower inference cost in both continual and non-continual settings, while also reducing training cost in the continual setting."

Through detailed modeling of this dataset, we aim to constrain the key physical parameters of the explosion, infer the nature of the progenitor star and its environment, and probe the dynamical properties of the ejecta. We analyze photometric and spectroscopic data of SN 2022ngb. By constructing and modeling the bolometric light curve with semi-analytic models, we estimate the primary explosion parameters. The spectroscopic data are compared with those of well-studied SNe IIb and NLTE models to constrain the properties of the progenitor and the structure of the resulting ejecta. SN 2022ngb is a low-luminosity SN IIb with a peak bolometric luminosity of L_bol = 7.76 (+1.15/-1.00) x 10^41 erg/s and a V-band rising time of 24.32 +/- 0.50 days. Light curve modeling indicates an ejecta mass of ~2.9-3.2 M_sun, an explosion energy of ~1.4 x 10^51 erg, and a low synthesized 56Ni mass of ~0.045 M_sun. Nebular phase spectra exhibit asymmetric line profiles, pointing to a non-spherical explosion and an anisotropic distribution of radioactive material. Our analysis reveals a relatively compact stripped-envelope progenitor with a pre-SN mass of approximately 4.7 M_sun (corresponding to a 15-16 M_sun ZAMS star). Our analysis suggests that SN 2022ngb originated from the explosion of a moderate-mass relatively compact, stripped-envelope star in a binary system. The asymmetries inferred from the nebular phase spectral line features suggest a non-spherical explosion."

It is crucial to accurately predict the content that VUs are interested in without exposing their privacy. Traditional federated learning (FL) can protect user privacy by sharing models rather than raw data. However, the training of FL requires frequent model transmission, which can result in significant communication overhead. Additionally, vehicles may leave the road side unit (RSU) coverage area before training is completed, leading to training failures. To address these issues, in this letter, we propose a federated distillation-assisted vehicle edge caching scheme based on lightweight denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed vehicle edge caching scheme has good robustness to variations in vehicle speed, significantly reducing communication overhead and improving cache hit percentage."

This paper proposes FUSER, the first feed-forward multiview registration transformer that jointly processes all scans in a unified, compact latent space to directly predict global poses without any pairwise estimation. To maintain tractability, FUSER encodes each scan into low-resolution superpoint features via a sparse 3D CNN that preserves absolute translation cues, and performs efficient intra- and inter-scan reasoning through a Geometric Alternating Attention module. Particularly, we transfer 2D attention priors from off-the-shelf foundation models to enhance 3D feature interaction and geometric consistency. Building upon FUSER, we further introduce FUSER-DF, an SE(3)$^N$ diffusion refinement framework to correct FUSER's estimates via denoising in the joint SE(3)$^N$ space. FUSER acts as a surrogate multiview registration model to construct the denoiser, and a prior-conditioned SE(3)$^N$ variational lower bound is derived for denoising supervision. Extensive experiments on 3DMatch, ScanNet and ArkitScenes demonstrate that our approach achieves the superior registration accuracy and outstanding computational efficiency."

    "abstract": "Testing and evaluating decision-making agents remains challenging due to unknown system architectures, limited access to internal states, and the vastness of high-dimensional scenario spaces. Existing testing approaches often rely on surrogate models of decision-making agents to generate large-scale scenario libraries; however, discrepancies between surrogate models and real decision-making agents significantly limit their generalizability and practical applicability. To address this challenge, this paper proposes intelligent resilience testing (IRTest), a unified online adaptive testing framework designed to rapidly adjust to diverse decision-making agents. IRTest initializes with an offline-trained surrogate prediction model and progressively reduces surrogate-to-real gap during testing through two complementary adaptation mechanisms: (i) online neural fine-tuning in data-rich regimes, and (ii) lightweight importance-sampling-based weighting correction in data-limited regimes. A Bayesian optimization strategy, equipped with bias-corrected acquisition functions, guides scenario generation to balance exploration and exploitation in complex testing spaces. Extensive experiments across varying levels of task complexity and system heterogeneity demonstrate that IRTest consistently improves failure-discovery efficiency, testing robustness, and cross-system generalizability. These results highlight the potential of IRTest as a practical solution for scalable, adaptive, and resilient testing of decision-making agents."

    "abstract": "The evolution of the Sun's large-scale surface magnetic field is well captured by surface flux transport models, which can therefore provide a natural constraint on the outer boundary condition (BC) of Babcock-Leighton (BL) dynamo models. For the first time, we propose a zero radial diffusion BC for BL dynamo models, enabling their surface field evolution to align consistently with surface flux transport simulations. We derive a zero radial diffusion BC from the Magnetohydrodynamic induction equation and evaluate its effects in comparison with two alternatives: (i) a radial outer BC, and (ii) a radial outer BC combined with strong near-surface radial pumping. The comparison is carried out both for the evolution of a single bipolar magnetic region and within a full BL dynamo model. The zero radial diffusion outer BC effectively suppresses radial diffusion across the surface, ensuring consistency between the evolution of the bipolar magnetic region in the BL dynamo and the surface flux transport model. With this outer BC, the full BL dynamo model successfully reproduces the fundamental properties of the solar cycle. In addition, the model naturally produces a surface magnetic field that is not purely radial, in closer agreement with solar observations. The physically motivated zero radial diffusion boundary condition paves the way for deeper insight into the solar and stellar cycles."

While standard Message-Passing GNNs (MPNNs) are efficient, they theoretically lack the expressive power to fully represent MILP structures. Conversely, higher-order GNNs (like 2-FGNNs) are expressive but computationally prohibitive. In this work, we investigate Subgraph GNNs as a theoretical middle ground. Crucially, while previous work [Chen et al., 2025] demonstrated that GNNs with 3-WL expressive power can approximate Strong Branching, we prove a sharper result: node-anchored Subgraph GNNs whose expressive power is strictly lower than 3-WL [Zhang et al., 2023] are sufficient to approximate Strong Branching scores. However, our extensive empirical evaluation on four benchmark datasets reveals a stark contrast between theory and practice. While node-anchored Subgraph GNNs theoretically offer superior branching decisions, their $O(n)$ complexity overhead results in significant memory bottlenecks and slower solving times than MPNNs and heuristics. Our results indicate that for MILP branching, the computational cost of expressive GNNs currently outweighs their gains in decision quality, suggesting that future research must focus on efficiency-preserving expressivity."

In this work, we propose TextGuider, a novel training-free method that encourages accurate and complete text appearance by aligning textual content tokens and text regions in the image. Specifically, we analyze attention patterns in MM-DiT models, particularly for text-related tokens intended to be rendered in the image. Leveraging this observation, we apply latent guidance during the early stage of denoising steps based on two loss functions that we introduce.

PSR J1728-4608 is a millisecond pulsar with a spin period of 2.86 ms, in a 5.05 hr orbit with a companion star. The pulsar exhibits a radio spectrum of the form $S_ν\\propto ν^α$, with a measured spectral index of $α= -1.8(3)$. It is eclipsed for 42% of its orbit at 888 MHz, and multi--frequency image--domain observations show that the egress duration scales with frequency as a power law with index $n = -1.74$, where longer duration eclipses are seen at lower frequencies. An optical counterpart is detected in archival Gaia data within $0.5''$ of the radio position. It has a mean G-band magnitude of 18.8 mag and its light curve displays characteristics consistent with a combination of ellipsoidal modulation and irradiation effects. We also report the nearest Fermi $γ$-ray source, located 2$'$ away from our source, as a possible association. A radio timing study constrains the intrinsic and orbital properties of the system, revealing orbital period variations that we attribute to changes in the gravitational quadrupole moment of the companion star. At the eclipse boundary, we measure a maximum dispersion measure excess of $2.0 \\pm 1.2 \\ \\mathrm{pc\\ cm^{-3}}$, corresponding to an electron column density of $5.9 \\pm 3.6 \\times10^{18} \\ \\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. Modelling of the eclipse mechanism suggests that synchrotron absorption is the dominant cause of the eclipses observed at radio wavelengths. The discovery and characterisation of systems like \\psr\\ provide valuable insights into pulsar recycling, binary evolution, the nature of companion-driven eclipses, and the interplay between compact objects and their plasma environments."

Recently, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods have been employed to reconstruct the avatars.

In this paper, we propose a 3DGS-based human avatar modeling framework, termed as Relightable and Dynamic Gaussian Avatar (RnD-Avatar), that presents accurate pose-variant deformation for high-fidelity geometrical details. To achieve this, we introduce dynamic skinning weights that define the human avatar's articulation based on pose while also learning additional deformations induced by body motion. We also introduce a novel regularization to capture fine geometric details under sparse visual cues. Furthermore, we present a new multi-view dataset with varied lighting conditions to evaluate relight. Our framework enables realistic rendering of novel poses and views while supporting photo-realistic lighting effects under arbitrary lighting conditions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, novel pose rendering, and relighting."

    "abstract": "The continuous scaling of deep neural networks has fundamentally transformed machine learning, with larger models demonstrating improved performance across diverse tasks. This growth in model size has dramatically increased the computational resources required for the training process. Consequently, distributed approaches, such as Federated Learning and Split Learning, have become essential paradigms for scalable deployment. However, existing Split Learning approaches assume client homogeneity and uniform split points across all participants. This critically limits their applicability to real-world IoT systems where devices exhibit heterogeneity in computational resources. To address this limitation, this paper proposes Hetero-SplitEE, a novel method that enables heterogeneous IoT devices to train a shared deep neural network in parallel collaboratively. By integrating heterogeneous early exits into hierarchical training, our approach allows each client to select distinct split points (cut layers) tailored to its computational capacity. In addition, we propose two cooperative training strategies, the Sequential strategy and the Averaging strategy, to facilitate this collaboration among clients with different split points. The Sequential strategy trains clients sequentially with a shared server model to reduce computational overhead. The Averaging strategy enables parallel client training with periodic cross-layer aggregation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10 datasets using ResNet-18 demonstrate that our method maintains competitive accuracy while efficiently supporting diverse computational constraints, enabling practical deployment of collaborative deep learning in heterogeneous IoT ecosystems."

While recent foundation models offer strong semantic reasoning, existing robotic task planners remain predominantly unimanual and fail to address the spatial, geometric, and coordination challenges inherent to bimanual manipulation in scene-agnostic settings. We present a unified framework for scene-agnostic bimanual task planning that bridges high-level reasoning with 3D-grounded two-handed execution. Our approach integrates three key modules. Visual Point Grounding (VPG) analyzes a single scene image to detect relevant objects and generate world-aligned interaction points. Bimanual Subgoal Planner (BSP) reasons over spatial adjacency and cross-object accessibility to produce compact, motion-neutralized subgoals that exploit opportunities for coordinated two-handed actions. Interaction-Point-Driven Bimanual Prompting (IPBP) binds these subgoals to a structured skill library, instantiating synchronized unimanual or bimanual action sequences that satisfy hand-state and affordance constraints. Together, these modules enable agents to plan semantically meaningful, physically feasible, and parallelizable two-handed behaviors in cluttered, previously unseen scenes. Experiments show that it produces coherent, feasible, and compact two-handed plans, and generalizes to cluttered scenes without retraining, demonstrating robust scene-agnostic affordance reasoning for bimanual tasks."

Our results demonstrate that, while bulk (unpatterned) films follow the standard Kondorsky model for domain reversal, the microstructures obey a modified Kondorsky model. This difference indicates that local magnetic fields from reversed domains significantly influence the coercive field in confined geometries.

It further establishes two major evaluation modules covering 15 dimensions. These dimensions specifically assess pairwise similarities (text-video, text-audio, video-audio), audio-video synchronization, lip-speech consistency, and carefully curated audio and video question-answering (QA) pairs, among others. Furthermore, VABench covers seven major content categories: animals, human sounds, music, environmental sounds, synchronous physical sounds, complex scenes, and virtual worlds.

    "abstract": "Learning dexterous bimanual manipulation policies critically depends on large-scale, high-quality demonstrations, yet current paradigms face inherent trade-offs: teleoperation provides physically grounded data but is prohibitively labor-intensive, while simulation-based synthesis scales efficiently but suffers from sim-to-real gaps. We present BiDemoSyn, a framework that synthesizes contact-rich, physically feasible bimanual demonstrations from a single real-world example. The key idea is to decompose tasks into invariant coordination blocks and variable, object-dependent adjustments, then adapt them through vision-guided alignment and lightweight trajectory optimization. This enables the generation of thousands of diverse and feasible demonstrations within several hour, without repeated teleoperation or reliance on imperfect simulation. Across six dual-arm tasks, we show that policies trained on BiDemoSyn data generalize robustly to novel object poses and shapes, significantly outperforming recent baselines. By bridging the gap between efficiency and real-world fidelity, BiDemoSyn provides a scalable path toward practical imitation learning for complex bimanual manipulation without compromising physical grounding."

    "abstract": "Multi-participant meetings occur across various domains, such as business negotiations and medical consultations, during which sensitive information like trade secrets, business strategies, and patient conditions is often discussed. Previous research has demonstrated that attackers with mmWave radars outside the room can overhear meeting content by detecting minute speech-induced vibrations on objects. However, these eavesdropping attacks cannot differentiate which speech content comes from which person in a multi-participant meeting, leading to potential misunderstandings and poor decision-making. In this paper, we answer the question ``who speaks what''. By leveraging the spatial diversity introduced by ubiquitous objects, we propose an attack system that enables attackers to remotely eavesdrop on in-person conversations without requiring prior knowledge, such as identities, the number of participants, or seating arrangements. Since participants in in-person meetings are typically seated at different locations, their speech induces distinct vibration patterns on nearby objects. To exploit this, we design a noise-robust unsupervised approach for distinguishing participants by detecting speech-induced vibration differences in the frequency domain. Meanwhile, a deep learning-based framework is explored to combine signals from objects for speech quality enhancement. We validate the proof-of-concept attack on speech classification and signal enhancement through extensive experiments. The experimental results show that our attack can achieve the speech classification accuracy of up to $0.99$ with several participants in a meeting room. Meanwhile, our attack demonstrates consistent speech quality enhancement across all real-world scenarios, including different distances between the radar and the objects."

    "abstract": "Although considerable attention has been devoted to the development of models for isothermal, rate-independent plasticity, many high-consequence performance assessments involve viscoplastic processes that generate substantial heat. In addition, materials may transit from a nearly isothermal, rate-independent regime to a viscous, temperature-dependent regime during these processes, which makes modeling more challenging. In this work, we develop a physics-augmented neural network (PANN) framework for modeling general temperature-dependent, rate-dependent inelastic processes firmly based on physical principles, including the second law of thermodynamics and coordinate equivariance. These embedded properties are enabled by a number of architectural innovations in the structure and training of an input convex and potential-based neural ordinary differential equation framework. The resulting neural network models are capable of representing a wide spectrum of rate- and temperature-dependence ranging from isothermal, rate-independent elastic-plastic phenomenology to rate-dependent fully viscous inelastic behavior, as we demonstrate. We also show that the framework is capable of modeling complex microstructural inelasticity and predicting the conversion of plastic work to heating when calibrated to stress-temperature observations."

    "abstract": "Single-channel 3D reconstruction is widely used in fields such as robotics and medical imaging. While this line of work excels at reconstructing 3D geometry, the outputs are not colored 3D models, thus 3D colorization is required for visualization. Recent 3D colorization studies address this problem by distilling 2D image colorization models. However, these approaches suffer from an inherent inconsistency of 2D image models. This results in colors being averaged during training, leading to monotonous and oversimplified results, particularly in complex 360° scenes. In contrast, we aim to preserve color diversity by generating a new set of consistently colorized training views, thereby bypassing the averaging process. Nevertheless, eliminating the averaging process introduces a new challenge: ensuring strict multi-view consistency across these colorized views. To achieve this, we propose LoGoColor, a pipeline designed to preserve color diversity by eliminating this guidance-averaging process with a `Local-Global' approach: we partition the scene into subscenes and explicitly tackle both inter-subscene and intra-subscene consistency using a fine-tuned multi-view diffusion model. We demonstrate that our method achieves quantitatively and qualitatively more consistent and plausible 3D colorization on complex 360° scenes than existing methods, and validate its superior color diversity using a novel Color Diversity Index."

    "abstract": "The prosperous development of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) has brought people's anxiety about the spread of false information on social media. Designing detectors for filtering is an effective defense method, but most detectors will be compromised by adversarial samples. Currently, most studies exposing AIGC security issues assume information on model structure and data distribution. In real applications, attackers query and interfere with models that provide services in the form of application programming interfaces (APIs), which constitutes the black-box decision-based attack paradigm. However, to the best of our knowledge, decision-based attacks on AIGC detectors remain unexplored. In this study, we propose \\textbf{FBA$^2$D}: a frequency-based black-box attack method for AIGC detection to fill the research gap. Motivated by frequency-domain discrepancies between generated and real images, we develop a decision-based attack that leverages the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for fine-grained spectral partitioning and selects frequency bands as query subspaces, improving both query efficiency and image quality. Moreover, attacks on AIGC detectors should mitigate initialization failures, preserve image quality, and operate under strict query budgets. To address these issues, we adopt an ``adversarial example soup'' method, averaging candidates from successive surrogate iterations and using the result as the initialization to accelerate the query-based attack. The empirical study on the Synthetic LSUN dataset and GenImage dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our prosed method. This study shows the urgency of addressing practical AIGC security problems."

    "abstract": "Understanding how vaccines perform against different pathogen genotypes is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies, particularly for highly genetically diverse pathogens like HIV. Sieve analysis is a statistical framework used to determine whether a vaccine selectively prevents acquisition of certain genotypes while allowing breakthrough of other genotypes that evade immune responses. Traditionally, these analyses are conducted with a single sequence available per individual acquiring the pathogen. However, modern sequencing technology can provide detailed characterization of intra-individual viral diversity by capturing up to hundreds of pathogen sequences per person. In this work, we introduce methodology that extends sieve analysis to account for intra-individual viral diversity. Our approach estimates vaccine efficacy against viral populations with varying true (unobservable) frequencies of vaccine-mismatched mutations. To account for differential resolution of information from differing sequence counts per person, we use competing risks Cox regression with modeled causes of failure and propose an empirical Bayes approach for the classification model. Simulation studies demonstrate that our approach reduces bias, provides nominal confidence interval coverage, and improves statistical power compared to conventional methods. We apply our method to the HVTN 705 Imbokodo trial, which assessed the efficacy of a heterologous vaccine regimen in preventing HIV-1 acquisition."

    "abstract": "Fusion systems producing isotopes via neutron-driven transmutation can achieve economic viability well before reaching energy breakeven. Incorporating carefully selected feedstock materials within the blanket allows fusion systems to generate both electrical power and high-value isotopes, expanding the space of viable concepts, significantly enhancing the economic value of fusion energy, and supporting an accelerated path to adoption. We calculate the value of this co-generation and derive a new economic breakeven condition based on net present value. At lower plasma gain, $Q_{\\mathrm{plas}}\\lesssim1-3$, high-value transmutation, such as medical radioisotopes, enables pure transmuter fusion systems operating at only a few megawatts of fusion power: for example, a 3 megawatt system transmuting ${}^{102}\\mathrm{Ru}\\rightarrow{}^{99}\\mathrm{Mo}$ could fulfill global ${}^{99}\\mathrm{Mo}$ demand with $Q_{\\mathrm{plas}}\\ll1$. At higher gain $Q_{\\mathrm{plas}}\\gtrsim3$, it becomes viable to generate electricity in addition to isotopes. For example, co-production of electricity and gold, transmuted from mercury in a fusion blanket, can reduce the required plasma gain for viability from $Q_{\\mathrm{plas}}\\sim10-100$ to $Q_{\\mathrm{plas}}\\sim3-5$. We further highlight techniques to enhance transmutation including magnetic mirrors, asymmetric neutron wall loading, and neutron multiplication. Fusion neutron-driven transmutation therefore offers a revenue-positive pathway for deploying fusion energy at terawatt-scale, starting from smaller megawatt-scale machines for radioisotope production and then scaling up to co-producing electricity and gold in larger fusion power plants."

    "abstract": "Thin, metallic magnetic films can support nonreciprocal spin waves due to the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI). However, these films typically have high damping, making spin wave propagation distances short (less than one micrometer). In this work, we theoretically study a thin ferromagnetic strip with iDMI and excite spin waves by driving a central segment of the strip. Spin waves propagate with different amplitudes to the left versus to the right from the driving region (i.e. nonreciprocity occurs) due to the iDMI. Our calculation based on spin-wave-dispersion plus our micromagnetic simulations both show that changing the driving segment width, driving frequency and static applied field strength tunes the nonreciprocity. Our calculation based on spin-wave-dispersion, using a so-called \"overlap function\" will allow researchers to predict conditions of maximum nonreciprocity, without the need for computational solvers. Moreover, to circumvent the issue of short propagation distances, we propose a geometry where iDMI is only present in the driving region and low-damping materials comprise the remainder of the strip. Our calculations show significant spin wave amplitudes over several microns from the excitation region."

    "abstract": "We examine a mechanism of spontaneous decoherence in which the generator of quantum dynamics is replaced by the imaginary-order spectral deformation $H^{1+iβ}$ of a positive Hamiltonian $H$. The deformation modifies dynamical phases through the factor $E^{iβ} = e^{iβ\\log E}$, whose rapid oscillation suppresses interference between distinct energies. A non-stationary-phase analysis yields quantitative estimates showing that oscillatory contributions to amplitudes or decoherence functionals decay at least as $O(1/|β|)$. The Born rule and the Hilbert-space inner product remain unchanged; the modification is entirely dynamical. The physical motivation for the deformation arises from clock imperfections, renormalization-group and effective-action corrections that introduce logarithmic spectral terms, and semiclassical quantum-gravity analyses in which complex actions produce spectral factors of the form $E^{iβ}$. Examples including FRW minisuperspace, quartic potentials, curved-background Hamiltonians, and a Schwarzschild interior-type model illustrate how the mechanism yields explicit decoherence rates. The parameter $β$ may be experimentally constrained through precision coherence measurements in low-noise quantum platforms. The mechanism contrasts with Milburn-type intrinsic decoherence, Diosi-Penrose gravitational collapse, and real-order fractional dynamics in that it acts purely through deterministic spectral phases of a single Hamiltonian. The analysis positions the framework as a compact and testable phenomenological representation of logarithmic spectral corrections appearing in quantum-gravity-motivated effective theories."

To examine the efficacy of our method, the proposed method is integrated into the latest Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) codec standard under development by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG). Our method supersedes the existing scaling method used by the current standard under development. It both reduces the overhead bits and improves the end-task accuracy. To further reduce the overhead in certain circumstances, we also propose a simplified method. Experiments show that using our proposed method shows 17.09% reduction in bitrate on average across different tasks and up to 65.69% for object tracking without sacrificing the task accuracy."

Benefiting from its atomic size, the diamond chip can integrate a tremendous amount of NV centers to improve the magnetic-field sensitivity. However, EPR spectroscopy using NV ensembles is less efficient due to inhomogeneities in both sensors and targets. Spectral line broadening induced by ensemble averaging is even detrimental to spectroscopy. Here we show a kind of cross-relaxation EPR spectroscopy at zero field, where the sensor is tuned by an amplitude-modulated control field to match the target. The modulation makes detection robust to the sensor's inhomogeneity, while zero-field EPR is naturally robust to the target's inhomogeneity. We demonstrate an efficient EPR measurement on an ensemble of roughly 30000 NV centers. Our method shows the ability to not only acquire unambiguous EPR spectra of free radicals, but also monitor their spectroscopic dynamics in real time."

    "abstract": "Texas ERCOT is experiencing rapid population growth that increases electricity demand and creates new reliability challenges. At the same time, decarbonization policies are being considered, adding uncertainty about future generation portfolios and system costs. This study evaluates how population driven load growth and proposed decarbonization regulations may affect ERCOT in 2030 using a capacity expansion model. Three population scenarios are analyzed: baseline, lower growth, and higher growth. For each scenario, additional cases introduce a CO2 emissions limit and a carbon price to assess their effects on system costs, generation mix, and non served energy. Results show that population growth increases total system costs and unmet demand, while storage needs and transmission transfer levels remain relatively stable. A CO2 emissions limit has almost no effect because ERCOT is already expected to meet the 2030 threshold. In contrast, carbon pricing produces a meaningful shift toward renewable generation and reduced use of natural gas, although cost impacts vary by scenario. These findings show the importance of accounting for demographic uncertainty in long term planning and suggest that carbon pricing may be a more effective decarbonization mechanism than static emissions limits. The study also provides a basis for future stochastic modeling that incorporates uncertainty in demand, renewable output, and fuel prices."

Our approach accounts for time-inconsistent preferences and actions, and our equilibrium policy is the best option an investor can take at any given time during the investment period. Moreover, we leverage the martingale properties of the equilibrium policy, design a RL model, and propose an Actor-Critic RL algorithm. All of our RL model parameters converge to the corresponding true values in a simulation study.

We propose CORE, a concept-first interaction layer that improves multi-turn stability without modifying model weights. CORE combines a small library of universal cognitive operators with a persistent Local Concept - a compact semantic state capturing the task, constraints, preferences, and intermediate results. Each model call receives only this concept state, the user's latest instruction, and the selected operator, eliminating the need to replay full history. A preliminary prototype simulating CORE's behavior shows about 42% reduction in cumulative prompt tokens, though this number reflects prototype conditions and should not be interpreted as a real-world performance estimate. CORE offers a model-agnostic mechanism that separates conceptual reasoning from language generation, suggesting a scalable direction for more stable multi-turn systems."

As is observed in various planar models of random geometry as part of the phenomenon of geodesic confluence, geodesics in $γ$-LQG tend to merge with each other. In particular, in Gwynne-Miller '19, it was established that in $γ$-LQG, geodesics targeted to a fixed point do coalesce in the sense that any two such geodesics almost surely merge before reaching their common target. However, in view of the randomness inherent to the geometry, it is a priori possible that while geodesics targeted to a fixed point do coalesce, there exists a sequence of geodesics $P_n$ converging to an exceptional geodesic $P$ as $n\\rightarrow \\infty$ such that $P_n$ does not overlap with $P$ for any $n$. In this paper, we prove that this is not possible, thereby establishing a strong confluence statement for $γ$-LQG for all $γ\\in (0,2)$. This extends the results obtained in Miller-Qian '20 for $γ=\\sqrt{8/3}$ to all subcritical values of $γ$. We discuss applications to the study of geodesic stars and geodesic networks and include a list of open questions."

Even the narrow component of the line is resolved with evident Fe K$α_{1}$ (6.404 keV) and K$α_{2}$ (6.391 keV) contributions in a 2:1 flux ratio, fully consistent with a neutral gas with negligible bulk velocity. The narrow and intermediate-width components have a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of 350 $\\pm$ 50 km/s and $3510 \\pm 470 \\, \\rm km/s$, respectively, suggesting that they arise in the outer disk/torus and/or BLR. We detect a $10\\%$ excess flux around 4 $-$ 7 keV that is not well described by a symmetric Gaussian line, but is consistent with a relativistically broadened emission line. In this paper, we take the simplest approach to model the asymmetric line as a single emission line (assuming either neutral, He-like or H-like iron) convolved with a relativistic disk line model. As expected, the inferred inclination angle is highly sensitive to the assumed ionization state, and ranges between $i=17-44^{ \\circ}$. This model also constrains the black hole spin via the extent of the red wing: the required gravitational redshift in the fitted disk-line profile disfavors a non-spinning (Schwarzschild) black hole. The derived inner radius is close to the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit $r_{\\rm ISCO}$ and strongly correlated with the black hole spin. To better constrain the spin, we fix the inner radius at $r_{\\rm ISCO}$ and derive a lower limit on the spin of $a \\ge 0.29$ at the 3 $σ$ confidence level.

For the two flares in AT 2020vdq if related to the repeating pTDEs scenario, theoretical TDE model determined stellar mass of the original star disrupted for the first flare should be not very different from the mass of the star (to trace the reminder of the original star) disrupted for the second flare, because a partial TDE with impact parameter $β$ smaller than 1 can lead to most of (probable higher than 90\\%) the stellar mass also bound to the reminder of the original star. After considering theoretical TDE model applied to describe the two flares in AT 2020vdq, the model determined stellar masses are about 2${\\rm M_\\odot}$ and $0.36{\\rm M_\\odot}$ for the stars disrupted in the first flare and the second flare.

However, their deployment on resource-constrained platforms is hindered by substantial computational and memory overhead, primarily stemming from higher-order automatic differentiation, intensive tensor operations, and reliance on full-precision arithmetic. To address these challenges, we present a framework that enables scalable and energy-efficient PINN training on edge devices. This framework integrates fully quantized training, Stein's estimator (SE)-based residual loss computation, and tensor-train (TT) decomposition for weight compression. It contributes three key innovations: (1) a mixed-precision training method that use a square-block MX (SMX) format to eliminate data duplication during backpropagation; (2) a difference-based quantization scheme for the Stein's estimator that mitigates underflow; and (3) a partial-reconstruction scheme (PRS) for TT-Layers that reduces quantization-error accumulation. We further design PINTA, a precision-scalable hardware accelerator, to fully exploit the performance of the framework. Experiments on the 2-D Poisson, 20-D Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB), and 100-D Heat equations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves accuracy comparable to or better than full-precision, uncompressed baselines while delivering 5.5x to 83.5x speedups and 159.6x to 2324.1x energy savings. This work enables real-time PDE solving on edge devices and paves the way for energy-efficient scientific computing at scale."

We find a preference for non-zero core radii of dark matter distributions in galaxies with stellar masses of $\\sim 10^{11}M_\\odot$. Our results imply a stronger feedback effect than that typically predicted by current hydrodynamical simulations. In addition, we provide a new constraint on the stellar-to-halo mass relation, where both stellar and halo masses are, for the first time, directly constrained by weak gravitational lensing. Our results prefer the stellar initial mass function (IMF) that is more bottom-heavy than the Salpeter IMF."

    "abstract": "The dynamic formulation of optimal transport, also known as the Benamou-Brenier formulation, has been extended to the unbalanced case by introducing a source term in the continuity equation. When this source term is penalized based on the Fisher-Rao metric, the resulting model is referred to as the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) setting, and allows for the comparison between any two positive measures without the need for equalized total mass. In recent work, we introduced a constrained variant of this model, in which affine integral equality constraints are imposed along the measure path. In the present paper, we propose a further generalization of this framework, which allows for constraints that apply not just to the density path but also to the momentum and source terms, and incorporates affine inequalities in addition to equality constraints. We prove, under suitable assumptions on the constraints, the well-posedness of the resulting class of convex variational problems. The paper is then primarily devoted to developing an effective numerical pipeline that tackles the corresponding constrained optimization problem based on finite difference discretizations and parallel proximal schemes. Our proposed framework encompasses standard balanced and unbalanced optimal transport, as well as a multitude of natural and practically relevant constraints, and we highlight its versatility via several synthetic and real data examples."

    "abstract": "We propose a single auxiliary-assisted purification-based framework for quantum error correction, capable of correcting errors that drive a system from its ground-state subspace into excited-state sectors. The protocol consists of a joint time evolution of the system-auxiliary duo under a specially engineered interaction Hamiltonian, followed by a single measurement of the auxiliary in its energy eigenbasis and a subsequent post-selection of one of the measurement outcomes. We show that the resulting purified state always achieves unit fidelity, while the probability of obtaining any energy of the auxiliary other than its ground state energy yields the success rate of the protocol. We demonstrate the power of this proposed method for several low-distance quantum codes, including the three-, four-, and five-qubit codes, and for the one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, subjected to bit-flip, phase-flip, and amplitude-damping noises acting on all qubits. Notably, the protocol expands the class of correctable errors for a given code, particularly in the presence of amplitude-damping noise. We further analyze the impact of replacing the auxiliary qudit with a single auxiliary qubit, and the changes in the performance of the protocol under the realistic scenario where noise remains active during the correction cycle."

Candidate circuits are evaluated with a hybrid quantum-classical variational classifier on the next generation firewall telemetry and network internet of things (NF-ToN-IoT-V2) cybersecurity dataset, after feature selection and scaling for quantum embedding. We benchmark our pipeline against an MLP-based surrogate, random search, and greedy GNN selection. The GNN-guided optimizer consistently finds circuits with lower complexity and competitive or superior classification accuracy compared to all baselines. Robustness is assessed via a noise study across standard quantum noise channels, including amplitude damping, phase damping, thermal relaxation, depolarizing, and readout bit flip noise. The implementation is fully reproducible, with time benchmarking and export of best found circuits, providing a scalable and interpretable route to automated quantum circuit discovery."

Experts treat these outputs as raw material, further refine them, and organize the results into precise statements and rigorous proofs. We instantiate this workflow in a case study on the connection between manifold optimization and Grover's quantum search algorithm, where the pipeline helps identify invariant subspaces, explore Grover-compatible retractions, and obtain convergence guarantees for the retraction-based gradient method. The framework provides a practical template for integrating large language models into frontier mathematical research, enabling faster exploration of proof space and algorithm design while maintaining transparent reasoning responsibilities.

Compared to traditional MPC procedures, which rely on slow search algorithms or on iteratively solving optimization problems exactly, gradient-based planning offers a computationally efficient alternative. However, the performance of gradient-based planning has thus far lagged behind that of other approaches. In this paper, we propose improved methods for training world models that enable efficient gradient-based planning. We begin with the observation that although a world model is trained on a next-state prediction objective, it is used at test-time to instead estimate a sequence of actions. The goal of our work is to close this train-test gap. To that end, we propose train-time data synthesis techniques that enable significantly improved gradient-based planning with existing world models. At test time, our approach outperforms or matches the classical gradient-free cross-entropy method (CEM) across a variety of object manipulation and navigation tasks in 10% of the time budget."

However, their massive scale, often billions of parameters, poses significant challenges for real-time deployment, as inference becomes computationally expensive and latency-sensitive in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose Token Expand-and-Merge-VLA (TEAM-VLA), a training-free token compression framework that accelerates VLA inference while preserving task performance. TEAM-VLA introduces a dynamic token expansion mechanism that identifies and samples additional informative tokens in the spatial vicinity of attention-highlighted regions, enhancing contextual completeness. These expanded tokens are then selectively merged in deeper layers under action-aware guidance, effectively reducing redundancy while maintaining semantic coherence. By coupling expansion and merging within a single feed-forward pass, TEAM-VLA achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness, without any retraining or parameter updates. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that TEAM-VLA consistently improves inference speed while maintaining or even surpassing the task success rate of full VLA models.

This includes a discussion about the appropriate target algebra of regularized distributions and the renormalization scheme as a Rota--Baxter operator thereon. In particular, we show that the Hadamard singular part satisfies the Rota--Baxter property and thus relate factorization in Epstein--Glaser with multiplicativity in Connes--Kreimer. Next, we define $Z$-factors as the images of the counterterm map under the corresponding combinatorial Green's functions. This allows us to define the multiplicatively renormalized Lagrange density, for which we show that the corresponding Feynman rules are regular. Finally, we exemplify the developed theory by working out the specific case of $φ^3_6$-theory."

This paper explores the applicability and performance of FaaS frameworks in the context of a modern particle accelerator control system, with the objective of evaluating their suitability for short lived and triggered workloads. In this paper, we evaluate prominent open-source FaaS platforms in executing functional logic, triggers, and diagnostics routines. Evaluation metrics consist of cold-start latency, scalability, performance, integration with other open-source tools like Kafka. Experimental workloads were designed to simulate real-world control tasks when implemented as stateless FaaS functions. These workloads were benchmarked under various invocation loads and network conditions. Self-hosted FaaS platforms, when deployed within accelerator networks, offer greater control over execution environment, better integration with legacy systems, and support for real-time guarantees when paired with message queues. Based on lessons learned and evaluation metrics, this paper describes reliability of the FaaS framework for the Accelerator Control Systems (ACS)."

However, likelihood calculation for these models is extremely costly, requiring thousands of function evaluations per sample, severely limiting their adoption. In this work, we propose Few-step Accurate Likelihoods for Continuous Flows (FALCON), a method which allows for few-step sampling with a likelihood accurate enough for importance sampling applications by introducing a hybrid training objective that encourages invertibility.

By exploiting the structure of factored state spaces, we introduce an exact, search-based algorithm that circumvents the fidelity gaps of surrogate models.

Our proposed method, YOPO-Nav (You Only Pass Once), encodes an environment into a compact spatial representation composed of interconnected local 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models. During navigation, the framework aligns the robot's current visual observation with this representation and predicts actions that guide it back toward the demonstrated trajectory. YOPO-Nav employs a hierarchical design: a visual place recognition (VPR) module provides coarse localization, while the local 3DGS models refine the goal and intermediate poses to generate control actions. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the YOPO-Campus dataset, comprising 4 hours of egocentric video and robot controller inputs from over 6 km of human-teleoperated robot trajectories. We benchmark recent visual navigation methods on trajectories from YOPO-Campus using a Clearpath Jackal robot.

However, precise coordination between these platforms in real-time scenarios presents major challenges, particularly when external localization infrastructure such as GPS or GNSS is unavailable or degraded [1]. This paper proposes a vision-based, data-driven framework for real-time UAV-UGV integration, with a focus on robust UGV detection and heading angle prediction for navigation and coordination. The system employs a fine-tuned YOLOv5 model to detect UGVs and extract bounding box features, which are then used by a lightweight artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the UAV's required heading angle. A VICON motion capture system was used to generate ground-truth data during training, resulting in a dataset of over 13,000 annotated images collected in a controlled lab environment. The trained ANN achieves a mean absolute error of 0.1506° and a root mean squared error of 0.1957°, offering accurate heading angle predictions using only monocular camera inputs. Experimental evaluations achieve 95% accuracy in UGV detection. This work contributes a vision-based, infrastructure- independent solution that demonstrates strong potential for deployment in GPS/GNSS-denied environments, supporting reliable multi-agent coordination under realistic dynamic conditions.

    "abstract": "Long-term planning in complex, text-based environments presents significant challenges due to open-ended action spaces, ambiguous observations, and sparse feedback. Recent research suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode rich semantic knowledge about the world, which can be valuable for guiding agents in high-level reasoning and planning across both embodied and purely textual settings. However, existing approaches often depend heavily on querying LLMs during training and inference, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy efficiently. In addition, these methods typically employ a pretrained, unaltered LLM whose parameters remain fixed throughout training, providing no opportunity for adaptation to the target task. To address these limitations, we introduce SCOPE (Subgoal-COnditioned Pretraining for Efficient planning), a one-shot hierarchical planner that leverages LLM-generated subgoals only at initialization to pretrain a lightweight student model. Unlike prior approaches that distill LLM knowledge by repeatedly prompting the model to adaptively generate subgoals during training, our method derives subgoals directly from example trajectories. This design removes the need for repeated LLM queries, significantly improving efficiency, though at the cost of reduced explainability and potentially suboptimal subgoals. Despite their suboptimality, our results on the TextCraft environment show that LLM-generated subgoals can still serve as a strong starting point for hierarchical goal decomposition in text-based planning tasks. Compared to the LLM-based hierarchical agent ADaPT (Prasad et al., 2024), which achieves a 0.52 success rate, our method reaches 0.56 and reduces inference time from 164.4 seconds to just 3.0 seconds."

Roughly, this means that a matrix formed by the model's log probabilities of various tokens conditioned on certain sequences of tokens is well approximated by a low rank matrix. In this paper, our focus is on understanding how this structure can be exploited algorithmically for obtaining provable learning guarantees. Since low logit rank models can encode hard-to-learn distributions such as noisy parities, we study a query learning model with logit queries that reflects the access model for common APIs. Our main result is an efficient algorithm for learning any approximately low logit rank model from queries. We emphasize that our structural assumption closely reflects the behavior that is empirically observed in modern language models. Thus, our result gives what we believe is the first end-to-end learning guarantee for a generative model that plausibly captures modern language models."

    "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision Models (VLMs), exhibit state-of-the-art performance but remain vulnerable to hardware-based threats, specifically bit-flip attacks (BFAs). Existing BFA discovery methods lack generalizability and struggle to scale, often failing to analyze the vast parameter space and complex interdependencies of modern foundation models in a reasonable time. This paper proposes FlipLLM, a reinforcement learning (RL) architecture-agnostic framework that formulates BFA discovery as a sequential decision-making problem. FlipLLM combines sensitivity-guided layer pruning with Q-learning to efficiently identify minimal, high-impact bit sets that can induce catastrophic failure. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of FlipLLM by applying it to a diverse set of models, including prominent text-only LLMs (GPT-2 Large, LLaMA 3.1 8B, and DeepSeek-V2 7B), VLMs such as LLaVA 1.6, and datasets, such as MMLU, MMLU-Pro, VQAv2, and TextVQA. Our results show that FlipLLM can identify critical bits that are vulnerable to BFAs up to 2.5x faster than SOTA methods. We demonstrate that flipping the FlipLLM-identified bits plummets the accuracy of LLaMA 3.1 8B from 69.9% to ~0.2%, and for LLaVA's VQA score from 78% to almost 0%, by flipping as few as 5 and 7 bits, respectively. Further analysis reveals that applying standard hardware protection mechanisms, such as ECC SECDED, to the FlipLLM-identified bit locations completely mitigates the BFA impact, demonstrating the practical value of our framework in guiding hardware-level defenses. FlipLLM offers the first scalable and adaptive methodology for exploring the BFA vulnerability of both language and multimodal foundation models, paving the way for comprehensive hardware-security evaluation."

In view of these observations and the future expectations of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) on which the EHT observations are based, an intensive research work has been carried out in the literature to simulating light trajectories and reconstructing the corresponding optical appearance for a wide array of modified black holes and ultra-compact objects. The corresponding images are directly affected not only by the background space-time geometry but also by the physics of the accretion disk, whose combination yields a characteristic fingerprint. In this paper, we consider such a fingerprint for objects which are not asymptotically flat but instead approach a Anti-de Sitter space-time. This assumption significantly influences light trajectories and, consequently, the corresponding images of the objects as seen by an observer at some distance, which can be used in future VLBI observations for testing alternatives of this kind to the Kerr paradigm. We illustrate our considerations with the examples of a Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter black hole and a black string, discussing their most notable departures from canonical, asymptotically-flat black hole space-times."

However, their training on sensitive patient data raises critical privacy and compliance challenges under regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, which enforce the \"right to be forgotten\". Unlearning, the process of tuning models to selectively remove the influence of specific training data points, offers a potential solution, yet its effectiveness in complex medical settings remains underexplored. To systematically study this, we introduce MedForget, a Hierarchy-Aware Multimodal Unlearning Testbed with explicit retain and forget splits and evaluation sets containing rephrased variants. MedForget models hospital data as a nested hierarchy (Institution -> Patient -> Study -> Section), enabling fine-grained assessment across eight organizational levels. The benchmark contains 3840 multimodal (image, question, answer) instances, each hierarchy level having a dedicated unlearning target, reflecting distinct unlearning challenges. Experiments with four SOTA unlearning methods on three tasks (generation, classification, cloze) show that existing methods struggle to achieve complete, hierarchy-aware forgetting without reducing diagnostic performance. To test whether unlearning truly deletes hierarchical pathways, we introduce a reconstruction attack that progressively adds hierarchical level context to prompts. Models unlearned at a coarse granularity show strong resistance, while fine-grained unlearning leaves models vulnerable to such reconstruction. MedForget provides a practical, HIPAA-aligned testbed for building compliant medical AI systems."

In this paper, we construct multiple specialized datasets providing reasoning and planning annotations for complex scenarios. Then, a unified Understanding-Generation-Planning framework, named UniUGP, is proposed to synergize scene reasoning, future video generation, and trajectory planning through a hybrid expert architecture. By integrating pre-trained VLMs and video generation models, UniUGP leverages visual dynamics and semantic reasoning to enhance planning performance. Taking multi-frame observations and language instructions as input, it produces interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning, physically consistent trajectories, and coherent future videos. We introduce a four-stage training strategy that progressively builds these capabilities across multiple existing AD datasets, along with the proposed specialized datasets. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in perception, reasoning, and decision-making, with superior generalization to challenging long-tail situations."

    "abstract": "Quantum error mitigation (QEM) is typically viewed as a suite of practical techniques for today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, with limited relevance once fault-tolerant quantum computers become available. In this work, we challenge this conventional wisdom by showing that QEM can continue to provide substantial benefits in the era of quantum error correction (QEC), and in an even more efficient manner than it does on current devices. We introduce a framework for logical-level QEM that leverages soft information naturally produced by QEC decoders, requiring no additional data, hardware modifications, or runtime overhead beyond what QEC protocols already provide. Within this framework, we develop and analyze three logical-level QEM techniques: post-selection and runtime abort policies, probabilistic error cancellation, and zero-noise extrapolation. Our techniques reduce logical error rates by more than 100x while discarding fewer than 0.1% of shots; they also provide in situ characterization of logical channels for QEM protocols. As a proof of principle, we benchmark our approach using a surface-code architecture and two state-of-the-art decoders based on tensor-network contraction and minimum-weight perfect matching. We evaluate logical-level QEM on random Clifford circuits and molecular simulation algorithms and find that, compared to previous approaches relying on QEC only or QEC combined with QEM, we can achieve up to 87.4% spacetime overhead savings. Our results demonstrate that logical-level QEM with QEC decoder soft information can reliably improve logical performance, underscoring the efficiency and usefulness of QEM techniques for fault-tolerant quantum computers."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate human communication, decision support, content creation, and information retrieval. Despite impressive fluency, these systems frequently produce biased or stereotypical content, especially when prompted with socially sensitive language. A growing body of research has demonstrated that such biases disproportionately affect low-resource languages, where training data is limited and culturally unrepresentative. This paper presents a comprehensive study of inference-time bias mitigation, a strategy that avoids retraining or fine-tuning and instead operates directly on model outputs. Building on preference-ranking models (PRMs), we introduce a unified evaluation framework comparing three methods: (1) baseline single-word generation, (2) PRM-Select best-of-N sampling, and (3) PRM-Sequential refinement guided by PRM critiques. We evaluate these techniques across 200 English prompts and their Urdu counterparts, designed to reflect socio-cultural contexts relevant to gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, disability, profession, age, and socioeconomic categories. Using GPT-3.5 as a candidate generator and GPT-4o-mini as a PRM-based bias and utility scorer, we provide an extensive quantitative analysis of bias reduction, utility preservation, and cross-lingual disparities. Our findings show: (a) substantial gains over the baseline for both languages; (b) consistently lower fairness scores for Urdu across all methods, highlighting structural inequities in multilingual LLM training; and (c) distinct improvement trajectories between PRM-Select and PRM-Sequential. The study contributes an extensible methodology, interpretable metrics, and cross-lingual comparisons that can support future work on fairness evaluation in low-resource languages."

The layered 2D A-type antiferromagnet CrPS4 stands out among van der Waals (vdW) magnets for its rich optical fine structure, but its spectroscopy is not yet understood and has so far been interpreted without consideration of magnetic exchange. Here, we show that this fine structure comes primarily from exchange-mediated coupling between on-site optical \"spin-flip\" transitions of Cr3+ and low-energy spin transitions involving the surrounding lattice. Well-resolved magnon sidebands to optical 4A2 <--> 2E transitions are observed in photoluminescence (PL) and PL excitation spectra, as well as a pronounced PL sideband due to short-range exchange splitting. Energy migration is probed using Yb3+ dopants as traps, revealing sub-picosecond inter-site excitation hopping. Formation of dispersive Frenkel excitons of coupled on-site d-d transitions due to inter-site exchange is discussed. In addition to impacting how optical fine structure is interpreted in this and potentially other vdW magnets, these findings may have ramifications for future applications of layered 2D magnets by revealing new opportunities to drive mode-specific spin-wave excitations using light."

In this work, we propose a \\emph{relaxed randomized averaging block extended Bregman-Kaczmarz} (rRABEBK) method for solving a broad class of combined optimization problems. The proposed method integrates an averaging block strategy with two relaxation parameters to accelerate convergence and enhance numerical stability. We establish a rigorous convergence theory showing that rRABEBK achieves linear convergence in expectation, with explicit constants that quantify the effect of the relaxation mechanism, and a provably faster rate than the classical randomized extended Bregman-Kaczmarz method. Our method can be readily adapted to sparse least-squares problems and extended to both consistent and inconsistent systems without modification. Complementary numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that rRABEBK significantly outperforms the existing Kaczmarz-type algorithms in terms of both iteration complexity and computational efficiency, highlighting both its practical and theoretical advantages."

We then show that the converse is not true: we construct a language whose generating series is algebraic (thus holonomic), but which is inherently weakly-ambiguous as a Parikh automata language. Finally, we prove an effective decidability result for the inclusion problem for weakly-unambiguous Parikh automata, and provide an upper-bound on to its complexity."

These include the one- and two-point probability distributions of the velocity, the multiplicity functions of voids and shocks, and the velocity and density correlation functions together with their associated power spectra. We also show that the full hierarchy of $n$-point distributions factorizes into a sequence of two-point conditional probabilities. This class of initial conditions leads to self-similar evolution and produces probability distributions characterized by stretched-exponential tails, with tail exponents spanning the full range from unity to infinity. The associated characteristic length scale grows as a power law of time, with an exponent lying between zero and one half."

The current research introduces novel approaches for constructing fair k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and fair epsilon-neighborhood graphs that proactively enforce demographic parity during graph formation. By incorporating fairness constraints at the earliest stage of neighborhood selection steps, our approaches incorporate proportional representation of sensitive features into the local graph structure while maintaining geometric consistency.Our work addresses a critical gap in pre-processing for fair spectral clustering, demonstrating that topological fairness in graph construction is essential for achieving equitable clustering outcomes. Widely used graph construction methods like kNN and epsilon-neighborhood graphs propagate edge based disparate impact on sensitive groups, leading to biased clustering results. Providing representation of each sensitive group in the neighborhood of every node leads to fairer spectral clustering results because the topological features of the graph naturally reflect equitable group ratios. This research fills an essential shortcoming in fair unsupervised learning, by illustrating how topological fairness in graph construction inherently facilitates fairer spectral clustering results without the need for changes to the clustering algorithm itself. Thorough experiments on three synthetic datasets, seven real-world tabular datasets, and three real-world image datasets prove that our fair graph construction methods surpass the current baselines in graph clustering tasks."

Here we use a cruciform bending platform to apply uniform biaxial strain up to 1.3% to trilayer WS2 while simultaneously monitoring excitonic and vibrational responses. Differential reflectance reveals strain-induced red-shifts of the A and B excitons, with the B exciton moving by about 170 meV. Under 532 nm excitation, this shift drives a continuous transition from resonant to non-resonant Raman scattering, leading to a pronounced collapse of the 2LA(M) mode. The 2LA(M) intensity is quantitatively described by a resonance model expressed in terms of the B-exciton energy, which yields an effective exciton-assisted linewidth of about 34 meV and shows that the maximum enhancement occurs when the laser lies roughly 50 meV below the exciton. The first-order phonons remain narrow and reversible over the full strain cycle, confirming elastic deformation and efficient isotropic strain transfer. Our results establish biaxial strain as a practical and reversible route to modulate exciton-phonon coupling and Raman scattering cross-sections, enabling mechanically reconfigurable optical and photonic functionalities in layered semiconductors."

Specifically, we show that any finitely-generated group quasi-isometric to such a product is, up to finite noise, an extension of a non-uniform rank one lattice by a nilpotent lattice. Furthermore, we show under extra conditions that this extension is nilcentral, a notion which generalizes central extensions to extensions by a nilpotent group."

    "abstract": "Battery energy storage systems (BESS) have become increasingly vital in three-phase unbalanced distribution grids for maintaining voltage stability and enabling optimal dispatch. However, existing deep learning approaches often lack explicit three-phase representation, making it difficult to accurately model phase-specific dynamics and enforce operational constraints--leading to infeasible dispatch solutions. This paper demonstrates that by embedding detailed three-phase grid information--including phase voltages, unbalanced loads, and BESS states--into heterogeneous graph nodes, diverse GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, GPS) can jointly predict network state variables with high accuracy. Moreover, a physics-informed loss function incorporates critical battery constraints--SoC and C-rate limits--via soft penalties during training. Experimental validation on the CIGRE 18-bus distribution system shows that this embedding-loss approach achieves low prediction errors, with bus voltage MSEs of 6.92e-07 (GCN), 1.21e-06 (GAT), 3.29e-05 (GPS), and 9.04e-07 (SAGE). Importantly, the physics-informed method ensures nearly zero SoC and C-rate constraint violations, confirming its effectiveness for reliable, constraint-compliant dispatch."

    "abstract": "Few-shot learning (FSL) mitigates data scarcity in cardiac MRI segmentation but typically relies on semi-supervised techniques sensitive to domain shifts and validation bias, restricting zero-shot generalizability. We propose PathCo-LatticE, a fully supervised FSL framework that replaces unlabeled data with pathology-guided synthetic supervision. First, our Virtual Patient Engine models continuous latent disease trajectories from sparse clinical anchors, using generative modeling to synthesize physiologically plausible, fully labeled 3D cohorts. Second, Self-Reinforcing Interleaved Validation (SIV) provides a leakage-free protocol that evaluates models online with progressively challenging synthetic samples, eliminating the need for real validation data. Finally, a dynamic Lattice-of-Experts (LoE) organizes specialized networks within a pathology-aware topology and activates the most relevant experts per input, enabling robust zero-shot generalization to unseen data without target-domain fine-tuning. We evaluated PathCo-LatticE in a strict out-of-distribution (OOD) setting, deriving all anchors and severity statistics from a single-source domain (ACDC) and performing zero-shot testing on the multi-center, multi-vendor M&Ms dataset. PathCo-LatticE outperforms four state-of-the-art FSL methods by 4.2-11% Dice starting from only 7 labeled anchors, and approaches fully supervised performance (within 1% Dice) with only 19 labeled anchors. The method shows superior harmonization across four vendors and generalization to unseen pathologies. [Code will be made publicly available]."

However, the use of AI techniques precludes certain standard software development practices, which emphasize rigorous testing to ensure the elimination of all bugs and adherence to well-defined specifications. ML models are trained on numerous high-dimensional examples rather than being manually coded. Consequently, the boundaries of their operating range are uncertain, and they cannot guarantee absolute error-free performance. In this paper, we propose to quantify uncertainty in ML-based systems. To achieve this, we propose to adapt and jointly utilize a set of selected techniques to evaluate the relevance of model predictions at runtime. We apply and evaluate these proposals in the highly heterogeneous and evolving domain of Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The results presented demonstrate the relevance of the approach, and we discuss in detail the assistance provided to domain experts."

Previous studies suggest that disc-dominated emission becomes more prominent with increasing optical luminosity. However, the redshift evolution of this relation remains debated, and a dependence on Eddington ratio, predicted by accretion flow models, is still observationally unconstrained. We revisit this relation using a large, nearly all-sky sample by combining the SDSS DR16Q QSO catalogue with X-ray data from XMM-Newton and the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey DR1, yielding 136,745 QSOs at redshifts $0.5 \\leq z < 3.0$. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian framework that treats X-ray detections and upper limits uniformly, enabling robust inference from both parametric and non-parametric models. We confirm a tight, sublinear $\\log L_X({\\rm 2\\,keV})$-$\\log L_ν({\\rm 2500\\,\\mathring{A}})$ correlation, but with a normalization at the lower end of previous estimates. Contrary to most literature results, we detect a mild but systematic redshift evolution: the relation flattens and its intrinsic scatter decreases at higher redshift. This trend is consistent with disc emission increasingly dominated by scattering and enhanced energy transfer to the X-ray corona, potentially indicating redshift evolution in the X-ray bolometric correction. We find no significant dependence on Eddington ratio, in tension with recent accretion flow models."

Single-trial decoding showed RPEs guided choices similarly in both species, but humans disproportionately recruited dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Cross-species alignment uncovered that macaque prefrontal circuits encode human-like optimal RPEs yet fail to translate them into action. Adaptability scaled not with RPE encoding fidelity, but with the areal extent of dACC/dlPFC recruitment governing RPE-to-action transformation. These findings resolve an evolutionary puzzle: behavioral performance gaps arise from executive cortical readout efficiency, not encoding capacity."

While they have shown considerable empirical success, significant challenges remain -- particularly regarding training stability and the lack of rigorous theoretical guarantees, especially when compared to classical mesh-based methods. In this work, we focus on the inverse problem of identifying a spatially varying parameter in a constitutive model of three-dimensional elasticity, using measurements of the system's state. This setting is especially relevant for non-invasive diagnosis in cardiac biomechanics, where one must also carefully account for the type of boundary data available. To address this inverse problem, we adopt an all-at-once optimisation framework, simultaneously estimating the state and parameter through a least-squares loss that encodes both available data and the governing physics. For this formulation, we prove stability estimates ensuring that our approach yields a stable approximation of the underlying ground-truth parameter of the physical system independent of a specific discretisation. We then proceed with a neural network-based discretisation and compare it to traditional mesh-based approaches. Our theoretical findings are complemented by illustrative numerical examples."

    "abstract": "The fundamental question of when a static or dynamic system should be deemed intrinsically quantum remains a challenge to address in absolute terms. A rigorous criterion, however, can be established by focusing on the measurable or reconstructible features of the system. This determination transcends mere issues of a system's classical simulability or computational complexity. Instead, the critical requirement lies in the certification (ideally, in real-time) of the emergence and persistence of genuine quantum features, principally entanglement and quantum superposition. Quantum Non-Demolition Measurements (QNDM) serve as the appropriate instrument for this certification, both from a theoretical and experimental standpoint. In this review paper, we demonstrate, with accessible clarity, how the implementation of QNDM can be directly linked to a necessary and sufficient condition for the violation of macrorealism in finite-dimensional systems, establishing a conceptual parallel with Leggett-Garg inequalities. Using concrete examples that detail the detection of negative terms in the quasi-probability density function resulting from QNDM, we introduce the core concepts for certifying genuinely quantum features. As specific examples, we discuss an application where the quantum-to-classical transition due to the interaction with an environment can be tracked by QNDM. Moreover, we argue about the robustness of QNDM protocols in the presence of noise sources and their advantages with respect to the Leggett-Garg inequalities. Because of its straightforward implementation, the QNDM approach can be of direct relevance to both the foundations of quantum mechanics and quantum information theory, where a controlled generation and certification of genuinely quantum resources is a central concern."

A key feature of MoLE is that each token id is associated with a dedicated group of experts. For a given input, only the experts corresponding to the input token id will be activated. Since the communication overhead of loading this small number of activated experts into RAM during inference is negligible, expert parameters can be offloaded to storage, making MoLE suitable for resource-constrained devices. However, MoLE's context-independent expert selection mechanism, based solely on input ids, may limit model performance. To address this, we propose the \\textbf{M}ixture \\textbf{o}f \\textbf{L}ookup \\textbf{K}ey-\\textbf{V}alue Experts (\\textbf{MoLKV}) model. In MoLKV, each expert is structured as a key-value pair. For a given input, the input-derived query interacts with the cached key-value experts from the current sequence, generating a context-aware expert output.

    "abstract": "Standard complexity analyses for weakly convex optimization rely on the Moreau envelope technique proposed by Davis and Drusvyatskiy (2019). The main insight is that nonsmooth algorithms, such as proximal subgradient, proximal point, and their stochastic variants, implicitly minimize a smooth surrogate function induced by the Moreau envelope. Meanwhile, explicit smoothing, which directly minimizes a smooth approximation of the objective, has long been recognized as an efficient strategy for nonsmooth optimization. In this paper, we generalize the notion of smoothable functions, which was proposed by Beck and Teboulle (2012) for nonsmooth convex optimization. This generalization provides a unified viewpoint on several important smoothing techniques for weakly convex optimization, including Nesterov-type smoothing and Moreau envelope smoothing. Our theory yields a framework for designing smooth approximation algorithms for both deterministic and stochastic weakly convex problems with provable complexity guarantees. Furthermore, our theory extends to the smooth approximation of non-Lipschitz functions, allowing for complexity analysis even when global Lipschitz continuity does not hold."

However, the openness of UAV-based communications leads to security and privacy concerns in wireless transmissions. This paper investigates a framework of UAV covert communications which introduces flexible reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (F-RIS) in UAV networks. Unlike traditional RIS, F-RIS provides advanced deployment flexibility by conforming to curved surfaces and dynamically reconfiguring its electromagnetic properties to enhance the covert communication performance. We establish an electromagnetic model for F-RIS and further develop a fitted model that describes the relationship between F-RIS reflection amplitude, reflection phase, and incident angle. To maximize the covert transmission rate among UAVs while meeting the covert constraint and public transmission constraint, we introduce a strategy of jointly optimizing UAV trajectories, F-RIS reflection vectors, F-RIS incident angles, and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) power allocation. Considering this is a complicated non-convex optimization problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm-based optimization solution. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed framework and optimization method significantly outperform traditional benchmarks, and highlight the advantages of F-RIS in enhancing covert communication performance within UAV networks."

Here, we propose a hybrid quantum architecture comprising a magnonic mode (in a YIG sphere), an Andreev spin qubit (ASQ), and a superconducting qubit (SCQ), to realize a strong three-body interaction at the single-quantum level. Leveraging the spin-dependent supercurrent and circuit-integration flexibility of the ASQ, it is possible to engineer a strong tripartite coupling that jointly excites both qubits upon magnon annihilation (or excites magnons and SCQs upon ASQ deexcitation). Through analytical and numerical studies, we demonstrate that this interaction induces synchronized collapse and revival in qubit populations when the magnon is initially prepared in a coherent state. Notably, during the collapse region -- where populations remain static -- the entanglement structure undergoes a dramatic and continuous reorganization. We show that the genuine tripartite entanglement is redistributed into bipartite entanglement between the two qubits, and vice versa, with the total entanglement conserved. These phenomena, unattainable via two-body couplings, underscore the potential of three-body interactions for exploring intrinsically new quantum effects and advancing hybrid quantum information platforms."

In our work, we show that introducing a domain wall into a chain with anisotropic superconducting correlations provides a powerful way to control both the number and the nature of these boundary modes. The defect acts as a digital knob: its presence or absence flips the parity of zero modes and thus decides whether an isolated Majorana exists at the chain ends. This on/off mechanism is significantly more robust and simpler than fine-tuning global parameters such as chemical potential or hopping amplitudes. Moreover, anisotropy provides an additional lever to calibrate the effect of the defect, opening a pathway to architectures where topological qubits can be locally addressed by domain walls. This proposal reframes defects not as imperfections, but as useful resources for quantum information and computation."

Through thickness-tuned multimode polariton engineering, we achieve photodetection of sub-bandgap photons via lower polariton states, validated through reflectance, photoluminescence (PL), and photocurrent spectroscopy with quantitative theoretical agreement. Trap-assisted two-photon absorption enables sustained strong coupling even under sub-bandgap excitation. The polariton dispersion yields ultrafast group velocities (~65 μm/ps), extending exciton diffusion lengths from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers.

    "abstract": "A control-theoretic framework for autonomous avatar-guided rehabilitation in virtual reality, based on interpretable, adaptive motor guidance through optimal control, is presented. The framework faces critical challenges in motor rehabilitation due to accessibility, cost, and continuity of care, with over 50% of patients inability to attend regular clinic sessions. The system enables post-stroke patients to undergo personalized therapy in immersive virtual reality at home, while being monitored by clinicians. The core is a nonlinear, human-in-the-loop control strategy, where the avatar adapts in real time to the patient's performance. Balance between following the patient's movements and guiding them to ideal kinematic profiles based on the Hogan minimum-jerk model is achieved through multi-objective optimal control. A data-driven \"ability index\" uses smoothness metrics to dynamically adjust control gains according to the patient's progress. The system was validated through simulations and preliminary trials, and shows potential for delivering adaptive, engaging and scalable remote physiotherapy guided by interpretable control-theoretic principles."

    "abstract": "We address the problem of fair classification in settings where data is scarce and unbalanced across demographic groups. Such low-data regimes are common in domains like medical imaging, where false negatives can have fatal consequences. We propose a novel approach \\emph{OxEnsemble} for efficiently training ensembles and enforcing fairness in these low-data regimes. Unlike other approaches, we aggregate predictions across ensemble members, each trained to satisfy fairness constraints. By construction, \\emph{OxEnsemble} is both data-efficient, carefully reusing held-out data to enforce fairness reliably, and compute-efficient, requiring little more compute than used to fine-tune or evaluate an existing model. We validate this approach with new theoretical guarantees. Experimentally, our approach yields more consistent outcomes and stronger fairness-accuracy trade-offs than existing methods across multiple challenging medical imaging classification datasets."

The formation of terrestrial planets in our solar system was strongly influenced by the radioactive decay heat of short-lived radionuclides (SLRs), particularly $^{26}$Al, likely delivered from nearby supernovae. However, current models struggle to reproduce the abundance of SLRs inferred from meteorite analysis without destroying the protosolar disk. We propose the `immersion' mechanism, where cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis in a supernova shockwave reproduces estimated SLR abundances at a supernova distance ($\\sim$1 pc), preserving the disk. We estimate that solar-mass stars in star clusters typically experience at least one such supernova within 1 pc, supporting the feasibility of this scenario. This suggests solar-system-like SLR abundances and terrestrial planet formation are more common than previously thought."

By integrating additional constraints and costs into the optimisation formulation, a mobile manipulator platform can reach its intended end effector pose while avoiding obstacles, even in cluttered scenes. We investigate the trade-offs of two methods for efficiently calculating robot-obstacle distances, comparing a purely geometric approach with a rasterisation-based approach. Our experiments in simulation on both synthetic and real-world scans demonstrate the feasibility of our method, showing that the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to controllers that rely on perfect ground-truth information."

    "abstract": "Generative audio models, based on diffusion and autoregressive architectures, have advanced rapidly in both quality and expressiveness. This progress, however, raises pressing copyright concerns, as such models are often trained on vast corpora of artistic and commercial works. A central question is whether one can reliably verify if an artist's material was included in training, thereby providing a means for copyright holders to protect their content. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of such verification through membership inference attacks (MIA) on open-source generative audio models, which attempt to determine whether a specific audio sample was part of the training set. Our empirical results show that membership inference alone is of limited effectiveness at scale, as the per-sample membership signal is weak for models trained on large and diverse datasets. However, artists and media owners typically hold collections of works rather than isolated samples. Building on prior work in text and vision domains, in this work we focus on dataset inference (DI), which aggregates diverse membership evidence across multiple samples. We find that DI is successful in the audio domain, offering a more practical mechanism for assessing whether an artist's works contributed to model training. Our results suggest DI as a promising direction for copyright protection and dataset accountability in the era of large audio generative models."

    "abstract": "Synthesizing realistic human-object interactions (HOI) in video is challenging due to the complex, instance-specific interaction dynamics of both humans and objects. Incorporating controllability in video generation further adds to the complexity. Existing controllable video generation approaches face a trade-off: sparse controls like keypoint trajectories are easy to specify but lack instance-awareness, while dense signals such as optical flow, depths or 3D meshes are informative but costly to obtain. We propose VHOI, a two-stage framework that first densifies sparse trajectories into HOI mask sequences, and then fine-tunes a video diffusion model conditioned on these dense masks. We introduce a novel HOI-aware motion representation that uses color encodings to distinguish not only human and object motion, but also body-part-specific dynamics. This design incorporates a human prior into the conditioning signal and strengthens the model's ability to understand and generate realistic HOI dynamics. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results in controllable HOI video generation. VHOI is not limited to interaction-only scenarios and can also generate full human navigation leading up to object interactions in an end-to-end manner.

Recent work on data-driven methods has leveraged probabilistic models to achieve higher estimation accuracy, but these approaches cannot guarantee low inference latency at the same time and neglect scalability. As data dimensionality grows, optimization time can even exceed actual query execution time. Furthermore, inference with probabilistic models by sampling or integration procedures unpredictable estimation result and violate stability, which brings unstable performance with query execution and make database tuning hard for database users. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to cardinality estimation based on cumulative distribution function(CDF), which calculates range query cardinality without sampling or integration, ensuring accurate and predictable estimation results. With inference acceleration by merging calculations, we can achieve fast and nearly constant inference speed while maintaining high accuracy, even as dimensionality increases, which is over 10x faster than current state-of-the-art data-driven cardinality estimator. This demonstrates its excellent dimensional scalability, making it well-suited for real-world database applications."

HD 61005 is known to harbor large amounts of circumstellar dust in a dense ecliptic plane full of mm-sized particles plus attached, extended wing like structures full of micron sized particles, which are evidence for a strong LISM-dust disk interaction. These properties aided our ability to resolve the 220 au wide astrosphere of HD61005, the first ever observed for a main sequence G-star. The observed x-ray emission morphology is roughly spherical, as expected for an astrospheric structure dominated by the host star. The Chandra spectrum of HD 61005 is a combination of a hard stellar coronal emission (T=8 MK) at Lx = 6 x10e29 erg per sec, plus an extended halo contribution at Lx = 1x10e29 erg per sec dominated by charge exchange (CXE) lines, such as those of OVIII and NeIX. The Chandra CXE x-ray morphology does not track the planar dust morphology but does extend out roughly to where the base of the dust wings begins. We present a toy model of x-ray emission produced by stellar wind (SW)-LISM CXE interactions, similar to the state of the young Sun when it was approximately 100 Myrs old (Guinan and Engle 2007), and transiting through an approximately 1000 times denser part of the interstellar medium (ISM) such as a Giant Molecular Cloud (Stern 2003, Opher and Loeb 2024)."

However, the new property is essentially independent of the enlarging factor $λ$ once $λ> 1$. In contrast, we observe a continuum of partially greedy-like properties by varying $λ\\in [1,\\infty)$.

This conclusion stems from the conservative treatment, but so far, it has not been extended to a non-Hermitian framework. Recently, driven-dissipative bosonic condensation of Dirac exciton-polaritons was demonstrated in metasurface waveguides. Here, we report an experimental observation of spatial binding and energy quantization of Dirac exciton-polaritons in a halide perovskite metasurface. A combination of spatially profiled nonresonant optical excitation and exciton-polariton interaction forms an effective non-Hermitian complex potential responsible for the observed effect. In the case of tightly focused pump spots spanning from 9 to 17~$μ$m, several bound states simultaneously achieve macroscopic occupation, constituting a multi-mode bosonic condensation of exciton-polaritons. Our theoretical analysis based on the driven-dissipative extension of the Dirac equation reveals that the non-Hermitian character of the effective trap allows for confinement even in the case of the gapless Dirac-like photonic dispersion, both above and below the energy of the dispersion crossing."

    "abstract": "System engineering has been shifting from document-centric to model-based approaches, where assets are becoming more and more digital. Although digitisation conveys several benefits, it also brings several concerns (e.g., storage and access) and opportunities. In the context of Cyber- Physical Systems (CPS), we have experts from various domains executing complex workflows and manipulating models in a plethora of different formalisms, each with their own methods, techniques and tools. Storing knowledge on these workflows can reduce considerable effort during system development not only to allow their repeatability and replicability but also to access and reason on data generated by their execution. In this work, we propose a framework to manage modelling artefacts generated from workflow executions. The basic workflow concepts, related formalisms and artefacts are formally defined in an ontology specified in OML (Ontology Modelling Language). This ontology enables the construction of a knowledge graph that contains system engineering data to which we can apply reasoning. We also developed several tools to support system engineering during the design of workflows, their enactment, and artefact storage, considering versioning, querying and reasoning on the stored data. These tools also hide the complexity of manipulating the knowledge graph directly. Finally, we have applied our proposed framework in a real-world system development scenario of a drivetrain smart sensor system. Results show that our proposal not only helped the system engineer with fundamental difficulties like storage and versioning but also reduced the time needed to access relevant information and new knowledge that can be inferred from the knowledge graph."

Nowadays, event cameras are becoming more widely adopted as they surpass RGB cameras in capturing facial expression changes due to their high temporal resolution, low latency, computational efficiency, and robustness in low-light conditions. Despite these advantages, event-based approaches still encounter practical challenges, particularly in adopting mainstream deep learning models. Traditional deep learning methods for facial expression analysis are energy-intensive, making them difficult to deploy on edge computing devices and thereby increasing costs, especially for high-frequency, dynamic, event vision-based approaches. To address this challenging issue, we proposed the CS3D framework by decomposing the Convolutional 3D method to reduce the computational complexity and energy consumption. Additionally, by utilizing soft spiking neurons and a spatial-temporal attention mechanism, the ability to retain information is enhanced, thus improving the accuracy of facial expression detection. Experimental results indicate that our proposed CS3D method attains higher accuracy on multiple datasets compared to architectures such as the RNN, Transformer, and C3D, while the energy consumption of the CS3D method is just 21.97\\% of the original C3D required on the same device."

    "abstract": "High-fidelity lattice-Boltzmann very-large-eddy simulations are performed to describe the noise dissipation mechanisms in an acoustic liner subjected to grazing turbulent flow at a Mach number of 0.3 and plane acoustic waves. The study examines the effects of sound pressure level (ranging from 130 to 160 dB) and frequency, as well as the direction of acoustic-wave propagation relative to the grazing flow. The considered mechanisms of acoustic energy dissipation are the viscous losses along the internal walls of the orifice and the vortex shedding. The latter is quantified through Howe's energy corollary. In the absence of grazing flow, acoustic energy is dissipated almost equally during both inflow and outflow phases, with vortex shedding dominating at high SPL and viscous losses at low SPL. The introduction of a grazing flow alters the flow topology; in particular, the shear layer past the orifice generates a quasi-steady vortex that confines the acoustic-induced flow to the downstream half of the orifice. This topological change modifies the two noise dissipation mechanisms: viscous losses increase at low SPL because the grazing flow pushes the fluid toward the downstream lip of the orifice; vortex shedding becomes phase dependent, dissipating acoustic energy during the inflow phase and generating acoustic energy during the outflow phase. This explains why the net acoustic dissipation decreases in the presence of grazing flow, highlighting the crucial role of near-wall flow topology on liner performances."

It was demonstrated that this material undergoes a structural phase transition from the monoclinic to the hexagonal phase above 450 K. This transition enabled the construction of a ratiometric, phase-transition-based thermometer utilizing the luminescence intensity ratio of Stark lines of Eu3+ and Yb3+ ions, which exhibit SRmax values of 4.2% K^-1 and 1.15% K^-1, respectively. Moreover, increasing the Eu3+ ion concentration was shown to raise the phase transition temperature, thereby shifting the thermal operating range of both luminescent thermometers. Under 980 nm excitation, K3Yb(PO4)2:Eu3+ exhibits both cooperative luminescence from Yb3+ pairs and up-conversion emission from Eu3+ ions. Increasing the Eu3+ concentration enhances the Eu3+ luminescence intensity relative to the cooperative luminescence of Yb3+ pairs, resulting in a change in the emitted light color. The difference in the thermal quenching behavior of these two signals further enabled the development of a ratiometric thermometer with SRmax = 0.58% K^-1. These findings identify K3Yb(PO4)3:Eu3+ as a promising candidate for multimodal temperature sensing."

Existing approaches mainly rely on uniform pixel-wise color mapping across entire images, neglecting the inherent color variations induced by image content. This limitation hinders existing approaches from achieving adaptive retouching that accommodates both diverse color distributions and user-defined style preferences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Content-Adaptive image retouching method guided by Attribute-based Text Representation (CA-ATP). Specifically, we propose a content-adaptive curve mapping module, which leverages a series of basis curves to establish multiple color mapping relationships and learns the corresponding weight maps, enabling content-aware color adjustments. The proposed module can capture color diversity within the image content, allowing similar color values to receive distinct transformations based on their spatial context. In addition, we propose an attribute text prediction module that generates text representations from multiple image attributes, which explicitly represent user-defined style preferences. These attribute-based text representations are subsequently integrated with visual features via a multimodal model, providing user-friendly guidance for image retouching. Extensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance."

This study presents a robust and scalable modeling system for estimating soil properties in croplands, including soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), exchangeable potassium (K), and pH, using remote sensing data and environmental covariates. The system employs a hybrid modeling approach, combining the indirect methods of modeling soil through proxies and drivers with direct spectral modeling. We extend current approaches by using interpretable physics-informed covariates derived from radiative transfer models (RTMs) and complex, nonlinear embeddings from a foundation model. We validate the system on a harmonized dataset that covers Europes cropland soils across diverse pedoclimatic zones. Evaluation is conducted under a robust validation framework that enforces strict spatial blocking, stratified splits, and statistically distinct train-test sets, which deliberately make the evaluation harder and produce more realistic error estimates for unseen regions. The models achieved their highest accuracy for SOC and N. This performance held across unseen locations, under both spatial cross-validation and an independent test set. SOC obtained a MAE of 5.12 g/kg and a CCC of 0.77, and N obtained a MAE of 0.44 g/kg and a CCC of 0.77. We also assess uncertainty through conformal calibration, achieving 90 percent coverage at the target confidence level.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Image Quality Assessment (IQA) have leveraged Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate descriptive explanations. However, despite their strong visual perception modules, these models often fail to reliably detect basic low-level distortions such as blur, noise, and compression, and may produce inconsistent evaluations across repeated inferences. This raises an essential question: do MLLM-based IQA systems truly perceive the visual features that matter? To examine this issue, we introduce a low-level distortion perception task that requires models to classify specific distortion types. Our component-wise analysis shows that although MLLMs are structurally capable of representing such distortions, they tend to overfit training templates, leading to biases in quality scoring. As a result, critical low-level features are weakened or lost during the vision-language alignment transfer stage. Furthermore, by computing the semantic distance between visual features and corresponding semantic tokens before and after component-wise fine-tuning, we show that improving the alignment of the vision encoder dramatically enhances distortion recognition accuracy, increasing it from 14.92% to 84.43%. Overall, these findings indicate that incorporating dedicated constraints on the vision encoder can strengthen text-explainable visual representations and enable MLLM-based pipelines to produce more coherent and interpretable reasoning in vision-centric tasks."

    "abstract": "Task scheduling is a critical research challenge in cloud computing, a transformative technology widely adopted across industries. Although numerous scheduling solutions exist, they predominantly optimize singular or limited metrics such as execution time or resource utilization often neglecting the need for comprehensive multi-objective optimization. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes the Pareto-based Hybrid Whale-Seagull Optimization Algorithm (PHWSOA). This algorithm synergistically combines the strengths of the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and the Seagull Optimization Algorithm (SOA), specifically mitigating WOA's limitations in local exploitation and SOA's constraints in global exploration. Leveraging Pareto dominance principles, PHWSOA simultaneously optimizes three key objectives: makespan, virtual machine (VM) load balancing, and economic cost. Key enhancements include: Halton sequence initialization for superior population diversity, a Pareto-guided mutation mechanism to avert premature convergence, and parallel processing for accelerated convergence. Furthermore, a dynamic VM load redistribution mechanism is integrated to improve load balancing during task execution. Extensive experiments conducted on the CloudSim simulator, utilizing real-world workload traces from NASA-iPSC and HPC2N, demonstrate that PHWSOA delivers substantial performance gains. Specifically, it achieves up to a 72.1% reduction in makespan, a 36.8% improvement in VM load balancing, and 23.5% cost savings. These results substantially outperform baseline methods including WOA, GA, PEWOA, and GCWOA underscoring PHWSOA's strong potential for enabling efficient resource management in practical cloud environments."

    "abstract": "Recent progress in BIQA has been driven by VLMs, whose semantic reasoning abilities suggest that they might extract visual features, generate descriptive text, and infer quality in a human-like manner. However, these models often produce textual descriptions that contradict their final quality predictions, and the predicted scores can change unstably during inference - behaviors not aligned with human reasoning. To understand these issues, we analyze the factors that cause contradictory assessments and instability. We first estimate the relationship between the final quality predictions and the generated visual features, finding that the predictions are not fully grounded in the features and that the logical connection between them is weak. Moreover, decoding intermediate VLM layers shows that the model frequently relies on a limited set of candidate tokens, which contributes to prediction instability. To encourage more human-like reasoning, we introduce a two-stage tuning method that explicitly separates visual perception from quality inference. In the first stage, the model learns visual features; in the second, it infers quality solely from these features. Experiments on SPAQ and KONIQ demonstrate that our approach reduces prediction instability from 22.00% to 12.39% and achieves average gains of 0.3124/0.3507 in SRCC/PLCC across LIVE, CSIQ, SPAQ, and KONIQ compared to the baseline. Further analyses show that our method improves both stability and the reliability of the inference process."

We introduce a geometry-consistent transcription that enables pseudospectral collocation without imposing manifold constraints extrinsically. The resulting method solves nonconvex manifold-constrained problems through a sequence of convex subproblems. A six-degree-of-freedom landing guidance example with unit quaternions and unit thrust-direction vectors demonstrates the practicality of the approach and preserves manifold feasibility to machine precision."

    "abstract": "Dense cores, the progenitors of stars, are in sub-pc scale and fragmented from pc-scale clumps. However, it is still unclear that how strongly the fragmentation process is affected by the properties of the host clumps, and how these properties influence the core distribution observed in recent millimeter (mm) and sub-mm observations. To systematically investigate this relation, we employed MHD simulations of convergent flows to generate a large sample of clumps and analyzed their properties using various techniques. Alignment parameters were used to quantify core distribution, while energy terms were calculated to assess the influence of gravity, magnetic fields, and turbulence. We found the core distribution only exhibiting weak correlations between alignment parameters and clump properties. For an individual clump, turbulence is believed to significantly contribute to these features by inducing non-homologous collapse and ongoing fragmentation. Nevertheless, for the entire population, more compact core distributions are observed due to the dominance of gravity. Overall, these factors suggest that clump properties are not sufficient to accurately determine core distribution."

We integrate analytical modeling, micromagnetic simulations, and \\textit{in situ} Lorentz transmission electron microscopy experiments to demonstrate that externally applied strain is a powerful stimuli for manipulating three-dimensional magnetic skyrmion strings. Analytical models predict that strain induces both elongation and bidirectional tilting of skyrmion strings in bulk systems, a finding corroborated by numerical simulations. These simulations further reveal that strain drives the system from fragmented multi-domain states toward unified single-domain configurations and facilitates skyrmion string rupture via bobber formation at critical strain levels. The collapse of the skyrmion lattice exhibits a temperature-dependent character, shifting from first-order to second-order behavior near the critical temperature $T_c$. Reducing sample thickness significantly increases the critical strain required for annihilation due to the suppression of tilting. Experimental validation on a $\\text{Co}_8\\text{Zn}_{8.5}\\text{Mn}_{3.5}$ sample confirms strain-induced elongation and subsequent collapse into a conical phase via anti-cluster formation, directly implicating strain-modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) as the primary mechanism in this system, over magnetocrystalline anisotropy. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of strain-mediated control in three-dimensional magnetic systems, demonstrating its feasibility for energy-efficient spintronic applications."

For metric--affine $f(R,Q)$ gravity we show that the connection equations admit an exact matrix solution, whose square--root structure generates a convergent binomial/Neumann expansion in powers of the stress tensor $T_{μν}$. For the Eddington--inspired Born--Infeld (EiBI) theory we show that the connection can be solved algebraically as well, and that its determinantal field equations produce a parallel Neumann expansion with coefficients fixed by the underlying determinant operator. This allows us to rewrite the Einstein--like equations in the auxiliary metric as an effective Einstein equation for $g_{μν}$ with a local algebraic correction $(ΔT)_{μν}$ that follows from a dual EFT built from the invariants $\\{T,\\,T^2,\\,T_{μν}T^{μν},\\ldots\\}$, organised by a characteristic density scale. We prove a convergence criterion based on the spectral radius of $\\hat T^μ_ν$ and interpret EiBI gravity as a determinantal resummation of the same $T$--tower. Extending the framework to symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity, we identify the EFT coefficients in terms of $f_Q$ and $f_{QQ}$ and present a background matching for $f(Q)=Q+αQ^2$.

The source-IRS and IRS-destination links are subject to various challenges, including atmospheric attenuation, asymmetric $α$-$μ$ distributed small-scale fading, and beam misalignment-induced pointing errors. The IRS link is characterized using the Laguerre series expansion (LSE) approximation, while both the source-IRS and IRS-destination channels are modeled as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) $α$-$μ$ fading channels. Furthermore, closed-form analytical expressions are derived for the outage probability (OP), average channel capacity (ACC), and average symbol error rate (ASER) for rectangular QAM (RQAM) and hexagonal QAM (HQAM) schemes over the end-to-end (e2e) link. The impact of random co-phasing and phase quantization errors are also examined. In addition to the theoretical analysis, deep neural network-based frameworks are developed to predict key performance metrics, facilitating fast and accurate system evaluation without computationally intensive analytical computations. Moreover, the asymptotic analysis in the high-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime yields closed-form expressions for coding gain and diversity order, providing further insights into performance trends. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations validate the theoretical formulations and present a comprehensive assessment of system behavior under practical conditions."

However, the distributed architecture, high openness, and deep heterogeneity of 6G networks expand the attack surface and pose unprecedented security challenges. To address this, security automation aims to enable intelligent security management across dynamic and complex environments, serving as a key capability for securing 6G ZTNs. Despite its promise, implementing security automation in 6G ZTNs presents two primary challenges: 1) automating the lifecycle from security strategy generation to validation and update under real-world, parallel, and adversarial conditions, and 2) adapting security strategies to evolving threats and dynamic environments. This motivates us to propose SecLoop and SA-GRPO. SecLoop constitutes the first fully automated framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) across the entire lifecycle of security strategy generation, orchestration, response, and feedback, enabling intelligent and adaptive defenses in dynamic network environments, thus tackling the first challenge. Furthermore, we propose SA-GRPO, a novel security-aware group relative policy optimization algorithm that iteratively refines security strategies by contrasting group feedback collected from parallel SecLoop executions, thereby addressing the second challenge. Extensive real-world experiments on five benchmarks, including 11 MITRE ATT&CK processes and over 20 types of attacks, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SecLoop and SA-GRPO. We will release our platform to the community, facilitating the advancement of security automation towards next generation communications."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a cornerstone modern physics, defining a wealth of phenomena in condensed-matter and high-energy physics, and beyond. It requires an infinite number of degrees of freedom, and even then, for continuous symmetries, it only works if the spatial dimension is not too low, following the classic results of Coleman, Hohenberg, Mermin and Wagner. While usually discussed in the context of quantum and statistical field theories, and in particular, effective field theories, there are advantages in addressing the same kind of phenomena on discrete geometric structures rather than conventional manifolds. When the space is discretized into a lattice, a lucid picture of conventional spontaneous symmetry breaking springs up, with the ultraviolet issues of continuum quantum field theory out-of-sight, and the key effect, which is infrared in nature, revealed through elementary harmonic oscillator networks. From there, it is natural to generalize lattices to other graphs/networks. In this setting, the presence of spontaneous symmetry breaking is controlled by fractional generalizations of resistance distance and the Kirchhoff index, and most broadly by the spectral dimension. Predictably, because of richness of discrete geometric structures in comparison with continuous manifolds, a broader array of geometries emerge where spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries is blocked by large fluctuations."

In this study, we employ deep learning to identify reaction coordinates for NaCl ion pair association and dissociation in water, using the committor as a quantitative measure of progress along the transition pathway through the transition state. The solvent environment surrounding the ions is encoded through descriptors based on atom-centered symmetry functions (ACSFs), which serve as input variables for the neural network. In addition, an explainable artificial intelligence technique is applied to identify ACSFs that contribute to the reaction coordinate. A comparative analysis of their correlation with CVs representing water bridging structures, such as interionic water density and the number of water molecules coordinating both ions, further provides a molecular-level interpretation of the ion association-dissociation mechanism in water."

We illustrate this modal dispersion cancellation in multimode fibers, thin diffusers and blazed gratings, and demonstrate its utility for broadband wavefront shaping of quantum states.

The $2\\to 2$ eikonal amplitude is measured by the transverse Green's function $(-Δ_Ω+a)G(Ω,Ω')=δ^{(2)}(Ω-Ω')$. As a consistency check, we use our formalism in flat space to find an exact match with the known flat space eikonal $2\\to 2$ amplitude in literature. We then extend the eikonal amplitude to arbitrarily many particles for the first time in both flat space and on the black hole background.

The kinetic models of Henry, Langmuir, Frumkin, Volmer and van der Waals are considered. First, treating the Ward-Tordai integral equation as a fractional order one, the partial differential model is transformed into a single fractional ordinary differential equation for the adsorption. A transformation of the obtained equation is proposed that reduces the number of parameters to two dimensionless groups (at Frumkin and van der Waals models a third parameter appears). In the simplest case of Henry adsorption isotherm the fractional differential model depends on a single dimensionless group and an exact solution exists, represented in terms of Mittag-Leffler functions. Based on this solution, second order asymptotes (at small values of the adsorption) are derived for the other models. The asymptotes of the adsorption result in a higher order asymptotes for the surface pressure (surface tension). For small surface coverage, all considered models converge to the Henry model's predictions, making it a universal first-order approximation for the surface tension. Next, the fractional differential model is written as an integral equation %of fractional order that can be considered as a generalization of the well-known Ward-Tordai equation to the case of barrier-diffusion control. For computer simulation of the obtained integral equation a predictor-corrector numerical method is developed and numerical results are presented and discussed."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Dense Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) have demonstrated remarkable performance in static environments. However, dense SLAM in dynamic environments remains challenging. Most methods directly remove dynamic objects and focus solely on static scene reconstruction, which ignores the motion information contained in these dynamic objects. In this paper, we present D$^2$GSLAM, a novel dynamic SLAM system utilizing Gaussian representation, which simultaneously performs accurate dynamic reconstruction and robust tracking within dynamic environments. Our system is composed of four key components: (i) We propose a geometric-prompt dynamic separation method to distinguish between static and dynamic elements of the scene. This approach leverages the geometric consistency of Gaussian representation and scene geometry to obtain coarse dynamic regions. The regions then serve as prompts to guide the refinement of the coarse mask for achieving accurate motion mask. (ii) To facilitate accurate and efficient mapping of the dynamic scene, we introduce dynamic-static composite representation that integrates static 3D Gaussians with dynamic 4D Gaussians. This representation allows for modeling the transitions between static and dynamic states of objects in the scene for composite mapping and optimization. (iii) We employ a progressive pose refinement strategy that leverages both the multi-view consistency of static scene geometry and motion information from dynamic objects to achieve accurate camera tracking. (iv) We introduce a motion consistency loss, which leverages the temporal continuity in object motions for accurate dynamic modeling. Our D$^2$GSLAM demonstrates superior performance on dynamic scenes in terms of mapping and tracking accuracy, while also showing capability in accurate dynamic modeling."

Standard Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) often suffers from inefficient exploration and fails to scale to large scenarios. We propose PGF-MAPPO (Path-Guided Frontier MAPPO), a hierarchical framework bridging topological planning with reactive control. To resolve local minima and sparse rewards, we integrate an A*-based potential field for dense reward shaping. Furthermore, we introduce Directional Frontier Allocation, combining Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) with geometric angle suppression to enforce spatial dispersion and accelerate coverage. The architecture employs a parameter-shared decentralized critic, maintaining O(1) model complexity suitable for robotic swarms. Experiments demonstrate that PGF-MAPPO achieves superior capture efficiency against faster evaders. Policies trained on 10x10 maps exhibit robust zero-shot generalization to unseen 20x20 environments, significantly outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines."

Leveraging these datasets, we propose ConFormer (Conditional Transformer), a novel framework that integrates graph propagation with guided normalization layer. This design dynamically adjusts spatial and temporal node relationships based on historical patterns, enhancing predictive accuracy. Our model surpasses the state-of-the-art STAEFormer in both predictive performance and efficiency, achieving lower computational costs and reduced parameter demands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ConFormer consistently outperforms mainstream spatio-temporal baselines across multiple metrics, underscoring its potential to advance traffic prediction research."

The leakage current was negligible (under noise-level of tool) up to 6 V and 11 V for 50 nm and 200 nm STO membrane respectively A high-quality dielectric was indicated by the CV profile, which showed almost negligible frequency dispersion in the frequency range of 10 kHz to 500 kHz. The dielectric constant was 50 to 82 with the 50 nm thick STO membrane and 115 to 186 in the 200 nm thick STO membrane. Thermal annealing of the membrane in ambient conditions at 250 degrees for 2 hours led to a slight improvement in the dielectric constant (8 to 20 percent), albeit at the expense of degraded leakage current performance, as indicated by a reduction of 1 V to 3 V in the \"no leakage region\" of the IV curves after annealing. The possible physical mechanisms responsible for these changes were also analyzed and discussed."

While machine-learning-based methods have shown some promise, many still rely on rule-based preprocessing designed by domain experts. Rule-based preprocessing methods often discard crucial context from the source code, potentially causing certain vulnerabilities to be overlooked and limiting adaptability to newly emerging threats. We introduce BugSweeper, an end-to-end deep learning framework that detects vulnerabilities directly from the source code without manual engineering. BugSweeper represents each Solidity function as a Function-Level Abstract Syntax Graph (FLAG), a novel graph that combines its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with enriched control-flow and data-flow semantics. Then, our two-stage Graph Neural Network (GNN) analyzes these graphs. The first-stage GNN filters noise from the syntax graphs, while the second-stage GNN conducts high-level reasoning to detect diverse vulnerabilities. Extensive experiments on real-world contracts show that BugSweeper significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art detection methods. By removing the need for handcrafted rules, our approach offers a robust, automated, and scalable solution for securing smart contracts without any dependence on security experts."

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable results in novel view synthesis, typically using sRGB images for supervision. However, little attention has been paid to the color space in which the network is learning the radiance field representation. Inspired by the BiIlluminant Dichromatic Reflection (BIDR) model, which suggests that a logarithmic transformation simplifies the separation of illumination and reflectance, we hypothesize that log RGB space enables NeRF to learn a more compact and effective representation of scene appearance. To test this, we captured approximately 30 videos using a GoPro camera, ensuring linear data recovery through inverse encoding. We trained NeRF models under various color space interpretations linear, sRGB, GPLog, and log RGB by converting each network output to a common color space before rendering and loss computation, enforcing representation learning in different color spaces. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that using a log RGB color space consistently improves rendering quality, exhibits greater robustness across scenes, and performs particularly well in low light conditions while using the same bit-depth input images. Further analysis across different network sizes and NeRF variants confirms the generalization and stability of the log space advantage."

    "abstract": "A language is said to be in catalytic logspace if we can test membership using a deterministic logspace machine that has an additional read/write tape filled with arbitrary data whose contents have to be restored to their original value at the end of the computation. The model of catalytic computation was introduced by Buhrman et al [STOC2014]. As our first result, we obtain a catalytic logspace algorithm for computing a minimum weight witness to a search problem, with small weights, provided the algorithm is given oracle access for the corresponding weighted decision problem. In particular, our reduction yields CL algorithms for the search versions of the following three problems: planar perfect matching, planar exact perfect matching and weighted arborescences in weighted digraphs. Our second set of results concern the significantly larger class CL^{NP}_{2-round}. We show that CL^{NP}_{2-round} contains SearchSAT and the complexity classes BPP, MA and ZPP^{NP[1]}. While SearchSAT is shown to be in CL^{NP}_{2-round} using the isolation lemma, the other three containments, while based on the compress-or-random technique, use the Nisan-Wigderson [JCSS 1994] based pseudo-random generator. These containments show that CL^{NP}_{2-round} resembles ZPP^NP more than P^{NP}, providing some weak evidence that CL is more like ZPP than P. For our third set of results we turn to isolation well inside catalytic classes. We consider the unambiguous catalytic class CUTISP[poly(n),logn,log^2n] and show that it contains reachability and therefore NL. This is a catalytic version of the result of van Melkebeek & Prakriya [SIAM J. Comput. 2019]. Building on their result, we also show a tradeoff between workspace and catalytic space. Finally, we extend these catalytic upper bounds to LogCFL."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled strong reasoning over both structured and unstructured knowledge. When grounded on knowledge graphs (KGs), however, prevailing pipelines rely on heavy neural encoders to embed and score symbolic paths or on repeated LLM calls to rank candidates, leading to high latency, GPU cost, and opaque decisions that hinder faithful, scalable deployment. We propose PathHD, a lightweight and encoder-free KG reasoning framework that replaces neural path scoring with hyperdimensional computing (HDC) and uses only a single LLM call per query. PathHD encodes relation paths into block-diagonal GHRR hypervectors, ranks candidates with blockwise cosine similarity and Top-K pruning, and then performs a one-shot LLM adjudication to produce the final answer together with cited supporting paths. Technically, PathHD is built on three ingredients: (i) an order-aware, non-commutative binding operator for path composition, (ii) a calibrated similarity for robust hypervector-based retrieval, and (iii) a one-shot adjudication step that preserves interpretability while eliminating per-path LLM scoring. On WebQSP, CWQ, and the GrailQA split, PathHD (i) attains comparable or better Hits@1 than strong neural baselines while using one LLM call per query; (ii) reduces end-to-end latency by $40-60\\%$ and GPU memory by $3-5\\times$ thanks to encoder-free retrieval; and (iii) delivers faithful, path-grounded rationales that improve error diagnosis and controllability. These results indicate that carefully designed HDC representations provide a practical substrate for efficient KG-LLM reasoning, offering a favorable accuracy-efficiency-interpretability trade-off."

Current methods struggle with generalization due to the scarce annotated 3D scene data or noisy 2D segmentations. While synthetic data generation offers a promising solution, existing 3D scene synthesis methods fail to simultaneously satisfy geometry diversity, context complexity, and layout reasonability, each essential for this task. To address these needs, we propose an Adapted 3D Scene Synthesis pipeline for class-agnostic 3D Instance SegmenTation, termed as ASSIST-3D, to synthesize proper data for model generalization enhancement. Specifically, ASSIST-3D features three key innovations, including 1) Heterogeneous Object Selection from extensive 3D CAD asset collections, incorporating randomness in object sampling to maximize geometric and contextual diversity; 2) Scene Layout Generation through LLM-guided spatial reasoning combined with depth-first search for reasonable object placements; and 3) Realistic Point Cloud Construction via multi-view RGB-D image rendering and fusion from the synthetic scenes, closely mimicking real-world sensor data acquisition. Experiments on ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, and S3DIS benchmarks demonstrate that models trained with ASSIST-3D-generated data significantly outperform existing methods. Further comparisons underscore the superiority of our purpose-built pipeline over existing 3D scene synthesis approaches."

However, detecting the 21cm signal is challenging due to the brighter foreground and associated observational difficulties. In this study, we evaluate the performance of various machine-learning regression models to improve parameter extraction and foreground removal. This evaluation is essential for selecting the most suitable machine learning regression model based on computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. We compare four models: Random Forest Regressor (RFR), Gaussian Process Regressor (GPR), Support Vector Regressor (SVR), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The comparison is based on metrics such as the root mean square error (RMSE) and $R^2$ scores. We examine their effectiveness across different dataset sizes and conditions, including scenarios with foreground contamination. Our results indicate that ANN consistently outperforms the other models, achieving the lowest RMSE and the highest $R^2$ scores across multiple cases. While GPR also performs well, it is computationally intensive, requiring significant RAM and longer execution times. SVR struggles with large datasets due to its high computational costs, and RFR demonstrates the weakest accuracy among the models tested. We also found that employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a preprocessing step significantly enhances model performance, especially in the presence of foregrounds."

This study proposes an innovative higher-order three-scale (HOTS) computational method, aimed at accurately and efficiently computing the transient nonlinear thermo-mechanical coupling problems of heterogeneous structures with multiple spatial scales. In these heterogeneous structures, temperature-dependent material properties have an important impact on the thermo-mechanical coupling responses, which is the particular interest in this work. At first, the detailed macro-meso-micro correlative model with higher-order correction terms is established by recursively two-scale analysis between macro-meso and meso-micro scales, which enables high-accuracy analysis of temperature-dependent nonlinear thermo-mechanical behaviors of heterogeneous structures with complicated three-scale configurations. The local error analysis mathematically illustrates the well-balanced property of HOTS computational model, endowing it with high computational accuracy. In addition, a two-stage numerical algorithm with off-line and on-line stages is proposed in order to efficiently simulate the nonlinear thermo-mechanical responses of heterogeneous structures with three-level spatial scales and accurately capture their highly oscillatory information at micro-scale. Finally, the high computational efficiency, high numerical accuracy and low computational cost of the presented higher-order three-scale computational approach are substantiated via representative numerical experiments. It can be summarized that this scalable and robust HOTS computational approach offers a reliably numerical tool for nonlinear multiphysics simulation of large-scale heterogeneous structures in real-world applications."

Under certain conditions, a dimple forms at the crater bottom, which pinches off to entrap a small bubble. The oscillation of this entrapped bubble is the primary source of the underwater sound produced by rain. We use simultaneous ultra-high-speed video imaging and synchronized acoustic recording, with an immersed hydrophone, to investigate the details of the sound formation, over a range of impact Weber numbers and different dimple shapes. With frame-rates as high as 5 million fps, we can track the shape evolution of the pinched off dimple-bubble, which experiences large volumetric compression, by as much as 50%. The subsequent volume oscillations are consistent with the observed $\\simeq 125$ Pa acoustic pressure amplitude, for the strongest compression. For our configuration the sound amplitude increases for smaller bubbles pinched off from the dimple. The acoustic forcing mechanism is therefore the inertial focusing of the momentum of the liquid outside the dimple, as it pinches off. The acoustic frequency agrees well with the Minnaert theory for freely oscillating spherical bubbles, of the same size. The finer details of the acoustic signal reveal an interplay between the larger dimple bubble and the tiny bubble entrapped during the initial contact between the drop and pool. For the singular dimple where no bubble is pinched off, the sound generation has a broader range of frequencies, with the tiny bubble oscillating at $\\sim 100$ kHz, after being deformed by the rapid vertical retraction of the dimple below the singular jet."

We present BatANN, a distributed disk-based approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) system that retains the logarithmic search efficiency of a single global graph while achieving near-linear throughput scaling in the number of servers. Our core innovation is that when accessing a neighborhood which is stored on another machine, we send the full state of the query to the other machine to continue executing there for improved locality. On 100M- and 1B-point datasets at 0.95 recall using 10 servers, BatANN achieves 6.21-6.49x and 2.5-5.10x the throughput of the scatter-gather baseline, respectively, while maintaining mean latency below 6 ms.

    "abstract": "Generating lifelike conversational avatars requires modeling not just isolated speakers, but the dynamic, reciprocal interaction of speaking and listening. However, modeling the listener is exceptionally challenging: direct audio-driven training fails, producing stiff, static listening motions. This failure stems from a fundamental imbalance: the speaker's motion is strongly driven by speech audio, while the listener's motion primarily follows an internal motion prior and is only loosely guided by external speech. This challenge has led most methods to focus on speak-only generation. The only prior attempt at joint generation relies on extra speaker's motion to produce the listener. This design is not end-to-end, thereby hindering the real-time applicability. To address this limitation, we present UniLS, the first end-to-end framework for generating unified speak-listen expressions, driven by only dual-track audio. Our method introduces a novel two-stage training paradigm. Stage 1 first learns the internal motion prior by training an audio-free autoregressive generator, capturing the spontaneous dynamics of natural facial motion. Stage 2 then introduces the dual-track audio, fine-tuning the generator to modulate the learned motion prior based on external speech cues. Extensive evaluations show UniLS achieves state-of-the-art speaking accuracy. More importantly, it delivers up to 44.1\\% improvement in listening metrics, generating significantly more diverse and natural listening expressions. This effectively mitigates the stiffness problem and provides a practical, high-fidelity audio-driven solution for interactive digital humans."

    "abstract": "In this work, we present analyses of four newly discovered planetary microlensing events from the 2024 KMTNet survey season: KMT-2024-BLG-0176, KMT-2024-BLG-0349, KMT-2024-BLG-1870, and KMT-2024-BLG-2087. In each case, the planetary nature was revealed through distinct types of anomalies in the lensing light curves: a positive bump near the peak for KMT-2024-BLG-0176, an asymmetric peak for KMT-2024-BLG-0349, a short-duration central dip for KMT-2024-BLG-1870, and a caustic-crossing feature for KMT-2024-BLG-2087. Detailed modeling of the light curves confirms that these anomalies are produced by planetary companions with planet-to-host mass ratios in the range of $(1.5\\text{--}17.9)\\times 10^{-3}$. Despite the diversity of signal morphologies, all planets detected in these events are giant planets with masses comparable to or exceeding that of Jupiter in the Solar System. Each planet orbits a host star less massive than the Sun, emphasizing the strength of microlensing in uncovering planetary systems around low-mass stellar hosts."

    "abstract": "The large-scale integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) has deteriorated the frequency/voltage (F/V) responses of power systems, leading to a higher risk of instability. Consequently, evaluating the F/V strength has become an important task in power electronics (PE)-dominated power systems. Existing methods typically examine F/V strength separately, employing fundamentally different metrics, such as inertia (focusing on device dynamics) and short-circuit ratio (SCR, addressing network characteristics). These fragmented approaches have resulted in a lack of comprehensive understanding of the overall system strength, potentially overlooking critical aspects. To address this problem, this paper proposes a unified framework for analyzing F/V strength. First, a unified modeling of F/V regulations is introduced. Then, based on modal decoupling, the power systems are decomposed into several eigen-subsystems, where the F/V responses are both decomposed into common-mode (CM) and differential-mode (DM) components, namely, CM-F, DM-F, CM-V, and DM-V. The CM-F and CM-V represent the collective response of all devices to external active or reactive power disturbances, independent of the power network characteristics. In contrast, the DM-F and DM-V capture the redistribution of disturbance power within the system, which is strongly influenced by the network topology and the locations of devices. Notably, traditional strength analysis generally ignores the CM-V (global voltage response), which, as discovered in this paper, may also become unstable in PE-dominated power systems. Based on the proposed framework, new metrics are proposed to evaluate the strength of each modal component. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulations."

    "abstract": "The reliance of organisations on computer networks is enabled by network programmability, which is typically achieved through Service Function Chaining. These chains virtualise network functions, link them, and programmatically embed them on networking infrastructure. Optimal embedding of Service Function Chains is an NP-hard problem, with three sub-problems, chain composition, virtual network function embedding, and link embedding, that have to be optimised simultaneously, rather than sequentially, for optimal results. Genetic Algorithms have been employed for this, but existing approaches either do not optimise all three sub-problems or do not optimise all three sub-problems simultaneously. We propose a Genetic Algorithm-based approach called GENESIS, which evolves three sine-function-activated Neural Networks, and funnels their output to a Gaussian distribution and an A* algorithm to optimise all three sub-problems simultaneously. We evaluate GENESIS on an emulator across 48 different data centre scenarios and compare its performance to two state-of-the-art Genetic Algorithms and one greedy algorithm. GENESIS produces an optimal solution for 100% of the scenarios, whereas the second-best method optimises only 71% of the scenarios. Moreover, GENESIS is the fastest among all Genetic Algorithms, averaging 15.84 minutes, compared to an average of 38.62 minutes for the second-best Genetic Algorithm."

The limit fields are stationary in space and non-stationary in time. The covariance and spectral structures of the resulting asymptotic random fields are provided.

    "abstract": "Accurate polyp segmentation during colonoscopy is critical for the early detection of colorectal cancer and still remains challenging due to significant size, shape, and color variations, and the camouflaged nature of polyps. While lightweight baseline models such as U-Net, U-Net++, and PraNet offer advantages in terms of easy deployment and low computational cost, they struggle to deal with the above issues, leading to limited segmentation performance. In contrast, large-scale vision foundation models such as SAM, DINOv2, OneFormer, and Mask2Former have exhibited impressive generalization performance across natural image domains. However, their direct transfer to medical imaging tasks (e.g., colonoscopic polyp segmentation) is not straightforward, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale datasets and lack of domain-specific knowledge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel distillation framework, Polyp-DiFoM, that transfers the rich representations of foundation models into lightweight segmentation baselines, allowing efficient and accurate deployment in clinical settings. In particular, we infuse semantic priors from the foundation models into canonical architectures such as U-Net and U-Net++ and further perform frequency domain encoding for enhanced distillation, corroborating their generalization capability. Extensive experiments are performed across five benchmark datasets, such as Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicDB, ETIS, ColonDB, and CVC-300. Notably, Polyp-DiFoM consistently outperforms respective baseline models significantly, as well as the state-of-the-art model, with nearly 9 times reduced computation overhead.

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the key issue in autonomous driving: small target recognition in dynamic perception. Existing algorithms suffer from poor detection performance due to missing small target information, scale imbalance, and occlusion. We propose an improved YOLOv8n-SPTS model, which enhances the detection accuracy of small traffic targets through three key innovations: First, optimizing the feature extraction module. In the Backbone Bottleneck structure of YOLOv8n, 4 traditional convolution modules are replaced with Space-to-Depth Convolution (SPD-Conv) modules. This module retains fine-grained information through space-to-depth conversion, reduces information loss, and enhances the ability to capture features of low-resolution small targets. Second, enhancing feature fusion capability. The Spatial Pyramid Pooling - Fast Cross Stage Partial Connection (SPPFCSPC) module is introduced to replace the original SPPF module, integrating the multi-scale feature extraction from Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) and the feature fusion mechanism of Cross Stage Partial Connection (CSP), thereby improving the model's contextual understanding of complex scenes and multi-scale feature expression ability. Third, designing a dedicated detection structure for small targets. A Triple-Stage Feature Pyramid (TSFP) structure is proposed, which adds a 160*160 small target detection head to the original detection heads to fully utilize high-resolution features in shallow layers; meanwhile, redundant large target detection heads are removed to balance computational efficiency. Comparative experiments on the VisDrone2019-DET dataset show that YOLOv8n-SPTS model ranks first in precision (61.9%), recall (48.3%), mAP@0.5 (52.6%), and mAP@0.5:0.95 (32.6%). Visualization results verify that the miss rate of small targets such as pedestrians and bicycles in occluded and dense scenes is significantly reduced."

    "abstract": "With the evolution of 6G networks, modern communication systems are facing unprecedented demands for high reliability and low latency. However, conventional transport protocols are designed for bit-level reliability, failing to meet the semantic robustness requirements. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel Semantic Information Transport Protocol (SITP), which achieves TCP-level reliability and UDP level latency by verifying only packet headers while retaining potentially corrupted payloads for semantic decoding. Building upon SITP, a cross-layer analytical model is established to quantify packet-loss probability across the physical, data-link, network, transport, and application layers. The model provides a unified probabilistic formulation linking signal noise rate (SNR) and packet-loss rate, offering theoretical foundation into end-to-end semantic transmission. Furthermore, a cross-image feature interleaving mechanism is developed to mitigate consecutive burst losses by redistributing semantic features across multiple correlated images, thereby enhancing robustness in burst-fade channels. Extensive experiments show that SITP offers lower latency than TCP with comparable reliability at low SNRs, while matching UDP-level latency and delivering superior reconstruction quality. In addition, the proposed cross-image semantic interleaving mechanism further demonstrates its effectiveness in mitigating degradation caused by bursty packet losses."

To this end, we propose a high-capacity diffusion-based image restoration foundation model, FoundIR-v2, which adopts a data equilibrium scheduling paradigm to dynamically optimize the proportions of mixed training datasets from different tasks. By leveraging the data mixing law, our method ensures a balanced dataset composition, enabling the model to achieve consistent generalization and comprehensive performance across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we introduce an effective Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven scheduler into generative pre-training to flexibly allocate task-adaptive diffusion priors for each restoration task, accounting for the distinct degradation forms and levels exhibited by different tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can address over 50 sub-tasks across a broader scope of real-world scenarios and achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art approaches."

We develop a multimodal facial expression analysis network to extract expression intensity features during patients' performance of various facial expressions. This network leverages the CLIP architecture to integrate visual and textual features while preserving the temporal dynamics of facial expressions. Subsequently, the expression intensity features are processed and input into an LSTM-based classification network for PD diagnosis. Our method achieves an accuracy of 93.1%, outperforming other in-vitro PD diagnostic approaches. This technique offers a more convenient detection method for potential PD patients, improving their diagnostic experience."

In this process, the beam generates a coherent transition radiation field and subsequently emits gamma rays through nonlinear Compton scattering. By manipulating the initial azimuthal momentum of the beam, the polarization angle of gamma rays relative to the transverse momentum can be controlled, yielding tunable hybrid CV polarization states. Three-dimensional spin-resolved particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate continuous tuning of the polarization angle across (-90°, 90°) with a high polarization degree exceeding 60%.

However, these methods highly depend on label information to correctly recover ordinal relationships of features, limiting their applications to semi-supervised regression. In this work, we extend contrastive regression methods to allow unlabeled data to be used in the semi-supervised setting, thereby reducing the dependence on costly annotations. Particularly we construct the feature similarity matrix with both labeled and unlabeled samples in a mini-batch to reflect inter-sample relationships, and an accurate ordinal ranking of involved unlabeled samples can be recovered through spectral seriation algorithms if the level of error is within certain bounds. The introduction of labeled samples above provides regularization of the ordinal ranking with guidance from the ground-truth label information, making the ranking more reliable. To reduce feature perturbations, we further utilize the dynamic programming algorithm to select robust features for the matrix construction. The recovered ordinal relationship is then used for contrastive learning on unlabeled samples, and we thus allow more data to be used for feature representation learning, thereby achieving more robust results. The ordinal rankings can also be used to supervise predictions on unlabeled samples, serving as an additional training signal. We provide theoretical guarantees and empirical verification through experiments on various datasets, demonstrating that our method can surpass existing state-of-the-art semi-supervised deep regression methods.

We then provide the Hamiltonian formulation for massless Majorana spinors and prove that the self-adjointness of the Hamiltonian leads to the angular momentum $a=0$ and spacetime reduces to the Schwarzschild spacetime, moreover, the massless Majorana spinor must be $φ$-independent.

We demonstrate that the highly disordered, mobile Na+ interlayer inherently facilitates mechanical cleavage down to few-nanometer thicknesses (about 4 nm). Optical interrogation via spectroscopic ellipsometry reveals NZTO as a wide-bandgap dielectric with pronounced optical birefringence (Delta_n about 0.25) across the visible and near-infrared spectrum.

For text-to-PSD generation, OmniPSD arranges multiple target layers spatially into a single canvas and learns their compositional relationships through spatial attention, producing semantically coherent and hierarchically structured layers. For image-to-PSD decomposition, it performs iterative in-context editing, progressively extracting and erasing textual and foreground components to reconstruct editable PSD layers from a single flattened image. An RGBA-VAE is employed as an auxiliary representation module to preserve transparency without affecting structure learning. Extensive experiments on our new RGBA-layered dataset demonstrate that OmniPSD achieves high-fidelity generation, structural consistency, and transparency awareness, offering a new paradigm for layered design generation and decomposition with diffusion transformers."

In this paper, we propose Training-free Context-adaptive Attention (TCA-Attention), a training-free sparse attention mechanism that selectively attends to only the informative tokens for efficient long-context inference. Our method consists of two lightweight phases: i) an offline calibration phase that determines head-specific sparsity budgets via a single forward pass, and ii) an online token selection phase that adaptively retains core context tokens using a lightweight redundancy metric. TCA-Attention provides a unified solution that accelerates both prefilling and decoding while reducing KV cache memory footprint, without requiring parameter updates or architectural changes. Theoretical analysis shows that our approach maintains bounded approximation error. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCA-Attention achieves a 2.8$\\times$ speedup and reduces KV cache by 61% at 128K context length while maintaining performance comparable to full attention across various benchmarks, offering a practical plug-and-play solution for efficient long-context inference."

Recent advancements have unveiled a rich tapestry of 3D topological magnetism. Nevertheless, the practical application of 3D topological magnetism in the development of topological spintronic devices remains a challenge. Here, we showcase the experimental utilization of 3D topological magnetism through the exploitation of skyrmion-edge attractive interactions in 90-nm-wide confined chiral FeGe and CoZnMn magnetic nanostructures. These attractive interactions result in two degenerate equilibrium positions, which can be naturally interpreted as binary bits for a skyrmion sliding switch. Our theory and simulation reveal current-driven spiral motions of skyrmions, governed by the anisotropic gradient of the potential landscape. Our experiments validate the theory that predicts a tunable threshold current density via magnetic field and temperature modulation of the energy barrier. Our results offer an approach for implementing universal on-off switch functions in 3D topological spintronic devices."

    "abstract": "Bug fixing is a critical activity in the software development process. In issue tracking systems such as JIRA, each bug report is assigned a priority level to indicate the urgency and importance level of the bug. The priority may change during the bug fixing process, indicating that the urgency and importance level of the bug will change with the bug fixing. However, manually evaluating priority changes for bugs is a tedious process that heavily relies on the subjective judgment of developers and project managers, leading to incorrect priority changes and thus hindering timely bug fixes. Given the lack of research on bug priority change prediction, we propose a novel two-phase bug report priority change prediction method based on bug fixing evolution features and class imbalance handling strategy. Specifically, we divided the bug lifecycle into two phases: bug reporting and bug fixing, and constructed bug priority change prediction models for each phase. To evaluate the performance of our method, we conducted experiments on a bug dataset constructed from 32 non-trivial Apache projects. The experimental results show that our proposed bug fixing evolution features and the adopted class imbalance handling strategy can effectively improve the performance of prediction models. The F1-score of the prediction model constructed for the bug reporting phase reached 0.798, while the F1-weighted and F1-macro of the prediction model constructed for the bug fixing phase were 0.712 and 0.613, respectively. Furthermore, we explored the cross-project applicability of our prediction models and their performance at different priority levels. The findings indicate large variations in model performance across different projects, although the overall scores remain decent. Meanwhile, the predictive performance across various priority levels remained relatively consistently high."

    "abstract": "3D visual grounding (3DVG) identifies objects in 3D scenes from language descriptions. Existing zero-shot approaches leverage 2D vision-language models (VLMs) by converting 3D spatial information (SI) into forms amenable to VLM processing, typically as composite inputs such as specified view renderings or video sequences with overlaid object markers. However, this VLM + SI paradigm yields entangled visual representations that compel the VLM to process entire cluttered cues, making it hard to exploit spatial semantic relationships effectively. In this work, we propose a new VLM x SI paradigm that externalizes the 3D SI into a form enabling the VLM to incrementally retrieve only what it needs during reasoning. We instantiate this paradigm with a novel View-on-Graph (VoG) method, which organizes the scene into a multi-modal, multi-layer scene graph and allows the VLM to operate as an active agent that selectively accesses necessary cues as it traverses the scene. This design offers two intrinsic advantages: (i) by structuring 3D context into a spatially and semantically coherent scene graph rather than confounding the VLM with densely entangled visual inputs, it lowers the VLM's reasoning difficulty; and (ii) by actively exploring and reasoning over the scene graph, it naturally produces transparent, step-by-step traces for interpretable 3DVG. Extensive experiments show that VoG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, establishing structured scene exploration as a promising strategy for advancing zero-shot 3DVG."

Recently, identification of fast-moving stars in the core of $ω$ Cen provided the strongest evidence to date for the presence of such an IMBH. One of the key questions in the study of IMBHs is their accretion efficiency, which determines their radio and X-ray signatures. We investigate the accretion signature of the IMBH in $ω$ Cen with ultra-deep radio continuum observations of the central region of the cluster. Using approximately 170 hours of Australia Telescope Compact Array observations, we achieve a root mean square noise of 1.1 $μ$Jy at 7.25 GHz, making this the most sensitive radio image of the cluster to date. We detect no radio emission at any of the proposed centers of the cluster, imposing stringent constraints on the presence of an accreting IMBH in $ω$ Cen. Considering the fundamental plane of black hole activity, our findings indicate that the accretion efficiency around the black hole is exceptionally low (with a conservative 3-$σ$ upper limit of $ε\\lesssim 4\\times10^{-3}$)."

Here, we introduce the concept of \\textit{dynamic stimulated emission}, whereby a quantum emitter undergoes stimulated emission with a time-dependent coupling. We show that, for both two- and three-level emitters, this process can be used to deterministically add or subtract a photon to a single propagating optical mode. We provide semi-analytic solutions to this problem for Fock states, enabling deterministic and unconditional single-photon subtraction and addition with fidelity ${\\cal F}>0.996$. Our semi-analytic solutions are provided for both dynamically coupled two-level systems and for three-level systems whose dynamical coupling is controlled by a coherent laser drive. Moving beyond individual Fock states, we further showcase the ability to subtract and add single photons to photon-number superposition states. We show that Schrödinger cat states can be prepared from squeezed vacuum input via cascaded subtraction or cascaded addition. Finally, we show that our photon-addition process can be used to add a photon to any squeezed and displaced state with high success probability and fidelity ${\\cal F}>0.99$, thereby potentially converting quantum emitters from single-photon sources to sources of single-photon-added Gaussian states without the need for inline squeezing. Our protocols provide a path towards integrating quantum emitters to construct efficient sources of single-mode non-Gaussian light beyond single photons."

We present a complete framework for producing high-fidelity deblended radio catalogs from the confused MIGHTEE maps using the probabilistic deblending framework XID+ and prior positions from deep multi-wavelength data in the COSMOS field. To assess performance, we construct MIGHTEE-like simulations based on the Tiered Radio Extragalactic Continuum Simulation (T-RECS) radio source population, ensuring a realistic distribution of star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) for validation. Through these simulations, we show that prior catalog purity is the dominant factor controlling deblending accuracy: a high-purity prior, containing only sources with a high likelihood of radio detection, recovers accurate flux densities and reproduces input source counts down to $\\sim 3σ$ (where $σ= $ thermal noise). On the other hand, a complete prior overestimates the source counts due to spurious detections. Our optimal strategy combines the high-purity prior with a mask that removes sources detected above $50~μ$Jy. Applied to the $\\sim$1.3\\,deg$^2$ area of the MIGHTEE-COSMOS field defined by overlapping multi-wavelength data, this procedure yields a deblended catalog of 89,562 sources. The derived 1.4\\,GHz source counts agree with independent P(D) analyses and indicate that we resolve the radio background to $\\sim 4.8\\,μ$Jy.

Building on this idea, we propose HiF-VLA (Hindsight, Insight, and Foresight for VLAs), a unified framework that leverages motion for bidirectional temporal reasoning. HiF-VLA encodes past dynamics through hindsight priors, anticipates future motion via foresight reasoning, and integrates both through a hindsight-modulated joint expert to enable a ''think-while-acting'' paradigm for long-horizon manipulation. As a result, HiF-VLA surpasses strong baselines on LIBERO-Long and CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks, while incurring negligible additional inference latency.

Our goals are to (1) flexibly fit personalized models for each prediction point and (2) retain model simplicity and interpretability. Our method fits a local model for each test observation by weighting the training data according to attention, a supervised similarity measure that emphasizes features and interactions that are predictive of the outcome. Attention weighting allows the method to adapt to heterogeneous data in a data-driven way, without requiring cluster or similarity pre-specification. Further, our approach is uniquely interpretable: for each test observation, we identify which features are most predictive and which training observations are most relevant. We then show how to use attention weighting for time series and spatial data, and we present a method for adapting pretrained tree-based models to distributional shift using attention-weighted residual corrections. Across real and simulated datasets, attention weighting improves predictive performance while preserving interpretability, and theory shows that attention-weighting linear models attain lower mean squared error than the standard linear model under mixture-of-models data-generating processes with known subgroup structure."

We discuss solutions to the equations of motion of the transverse scalars when they are constant along the world-volume directions and obey an $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$ or an $\\mathfrak{su}(2)\\oplus\\mathfrak{su}(2)$ algebra. Motivated by the membrane version of the weak gravity conjecture, we specialise our results to non-abelian domain-wall D$(d-2)$ branes embedded in AdS$_d$ flux vacua. We find that they can be less self-attractive than their abelian counterpart, opening up a new decay-channel for vacua that resist all abelian domain-wall destabilisations. These branes come in two types, depending on whether their fuzziness involves the radial direction, or is purely internal. Only the latter can develop in vacua free from abelian decays. We illustrate our construction by embedding these branes in a variety of AdS vacua, destabilising some of them."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a reliable learning-based adaptive control framework for nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) subject to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and singular control gains, two critical challenges in cyber-physical systems. A neural-variable-structure adaptive controller is developed to achieve leader-follower consensus while ensuring robustness to external disturbances and adaptability to unknown nonlinear dynamics. A reliability-assessment rule is introduced to detect communication loss during DoS attacks, upon which a switched control mechanism is activated to preserve closed-loop stability and performance. Unlike existing resilient MAS control methods, the proposed strategy explicitly accommodates singular control gains and does not rely on restrictive assumptions such as Lipschitz continuity or prior bounds on nonlinearities. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to integrate neural learning, variable-structure robustness, and reliability-based switching into a unified consensus-tracking control architecture for heterogeneous nonlinear MASs with singular input gains under DoS attacks. Lyapunov-based analysis establishes uniform ultimate boundedness of all closed-loop signals, and Matlab/Simulink simulations on a connected automated vehicle platoon demonstrate the method's effectiveness and resilience."

Using duality data induced by pinning structures, we define cohomological Milnor-Witt modules and establish a duality equivalence between homological and cohomological theories. As applications, we extend Chow-Witt groups to schemes over general (possibly singular or arithmetic) bases, prove generalized Bloch formulas and representability results, and compute graded Chow-Witt groups over Dedekind schemes of finite type over the integers.

    "abstract": "Linear spectral mixture models (LMM) provide a concise form to disentangle the constituent materials (endmembers) and their corresponding proportions (abundance) in a single pixel. The critical challenges are how to model the spectral prior distribution and spectral variability. Prior knowledge and spectral variability can be rigorously modeled under the Bayesian framework, where posterior estimation of Abundance is derived by combining observed data with endmember prior distribution. Considering the key challenges and the advantages of the Bayesian framework, a novel method using a diffusion posterior sampler for semiblind unmixing, denoted as DPS4Un, is proposed to deal with these challenges with the following features: (1) we view the pretrained conditional spectrum diffusion model as a posterior sampler, which can combine the learned endmember prior with observation to get the refined abundance distribution. (2) Instead of using the existing spectral library as prior, which may raise bias, we establish the image-based endmember bundles within superpixels, which are used to train the endmember prior learner with diffusion model. Superpixels make sure the sub-scene is more homogeneous. (3) Instead of using the image-level data consistency constraint, the superpixel-based data fidelity term is proposed. (4) The endmember is initialized as Gaussian noise for each superpixel region, DPS4Un iteratively updates the abundance and endmember, contributing to spectral variability modeling. The experimental results on three real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that DPS4Un outperforms the state-of-the-art hyperspectral unmixing methods."

    "abstract": "In this chapter, the Hilbert space framework in the mathematical theory of composite materials is introduced for studying the properties of effective operators. The goal is to introduce some of the key concepts and fundamental theorems in this area while showing that they follow naturally from using only basic results in operator theory on Hilbert spaces. These concepts include the $Z$-problem as an abstraction of a constitutive equation defined in terms of a bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space with a Hodge decomposition, direct and dual $Z$-problems with the duality interpretation of the inverse of an effective operator, and the notion of an $n$-phase composite with orthogonal $Z(n)$-subspace collection. These theorems include sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of both the solution of a $Z$-problem and the effective operator of a $Z$-problem, a representation formula for the effective operator as an operator Schur complement, the Dirichlet and Thomson minimization principles for the effective operator, the result on monotonicity and concavity of the effective operator map, and the Keller-Dykhne-Mendelson duality relations. Moreover, another important theorem given here (which may also be of independent interest to systems theorists) says that an effective operator of an $n$-phase composite with orthogonal $Z(n)$-subspace collection is the Schur complement of a normalized homogeneous semidefinite operator pencil (in particular, has a Bessmertnyĭ realization) and, up to a unitary equivalence, the converse is also true. Finally, the general theory presented here is shown to recover classical results dealing with effective conductivity but can also be applied to many other important problems involving composites in physics and engineering, e.g., in elasticity and electromagnetism."

Moreover, we introduce an optimization approach, formulated as a semidefinite program, that systematically searches for those witnesses best suited to reveal entanglement under the given measurement constraints. We demonstrate the practicality of the approach in a proof-of-principle experiment with photon-polarization qubits, where entanglement is certified using only a fraction of the full measurement data.

Traditional regret-minimisation bandit strategies like Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) typically rely on distributional assumptions or asymptotic guarantees; further, they remain largely focused on regret, neglecting their statistical properties. We address this gap. Through the adoption of CP, we bridge the regret-minimising potential of a decision-making bandit policy with statistical guarantees in the form of finite-time prediction coverage. We demonstrate the potential of it Conformal Bandits through simulation studies and an application to portfolio allocation, a typical small-gap regime, where differences in arm rewards are far too small for classical policies to achieve optimal regret bounds in finite sample. Motivated by this, we showcase our framework's practical advantage in terms of regret in small-gap settings, as well as its added value in achieving nominal coverage guarantees where classical UCB policies fail. Focusing on our application of interest, we further illustrate how integrating hidden Markov models to capture the regime-switching behaviour of financial markets, enhances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, and translates into higher risk-adjusted regret efficiency returns, while preserving coverage guarantees."

    "abstract": "The Earth's magnetosheath provides a high $β$ (ratio of electron thermal pressure to magnetic pressure) plasma environment where kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs) strongly influence turbulence and energy dissipation. This study investigates how Landau damping modifies the nonlinear evolution of KAWs by solving a modified nonlinear Schrödinger equation that captures both dispersive and nonlinear effects. Without Landau damping, modulational instability drives rapid self-focusing into intense magnetic filaments, producing a turbulent cascade with $k_\\perp^{-5/3}$ scaling in the inertial range ($k_\\perpρ_i<1$) that transitions to $k_\\perp^{-8/3}$ at sub-ion scales ($k_\\perpρ_i>1$), here $k_\\perp$ is the wavevector component perpendicular to the background magnetic field and $ρ_i$ the ion thermal gyroradius. When Landau damping is included, magnetic structures are significantly suppressed, and the spectrum steepens to $k_\\perp^{-11/3}$ in the sub-ion range while the inertial range maintains $k_\\perp^{-5/3}$ scaling. The damping acts across all scales through resonant wave-particle interactions, efficiently transferring energy from waves to particles. Direct comparison with Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft observations shows that the observed kinetic range spectral slope falls between our undamped and damped simulation limits, consistent with an intermediate damping regime in magnetosheath turbulence. This agreement confirms that Landau damping is one of the primary mechanisms controlling turbulent energy dissipation at kinetic scales in collisionless plasmas."

    "abstract": "In this project we are interested in performing clustering of observations such that the cluster membership is influenced by a set of predictors. To that end, we employ the Bayesian nonparameteric Common Atoms Model, which is a nested clustering algorithm that utilizes a (fixed) group membership for each observation to encourage more similar clustering of members of the same group. CAM operates by assuming each group has its own vector of cluster probabilities, which are themselves clustered to allow similar clustering for some groups. We extend this approach by treating the group membership as an unknown latent variable determined as a flexible nonparametric form of the covariate vector. Consequently, observations with similar predictor values will be in the same latent group and are more likely to be clustered together than observations with disparate predictors. We propose a pyramid group model that flexibly partitions the predictor space into these latent group memberships. This pyramid model operates similarly to a Bayesian regression tree process except that it uses the same splitting rule for at all nodes at the same tree depth which facilitates improved mixing. We outline a block Gibbs sampler to perform posterior inference from our model. Our methodology is demonstrated in simulation and real data examples. In the real data application, we utilize the RAND Health and Retirement Study to cluster and predict patient outcomes in terms of the number of overnight hospital stays."

We propose a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model, where first-stage decisions concern the composition of the delivery fleet and the design of consistent baseline routes. In the second stage, approximate recourse actions are introduced to adapt the initial routes in response to realized customer demands. The objective is to minimize the total delivery cost, including vehicle acquisition, travel distance, and penalty costs for unserved demand. To tackle the computational challenges arising in realistic problem instances, we develop a path-based reformulation of the model and design a Kernel Search-based heuristic to enhance scalability. Computational experiments on small synthetic instances, generated through a population-density-based sampling approach, are conducted to validate the formulation and assess the effects of demand stochasticity through standard stochastic measures, after applying a scenario reduction technique. Additional tests on large-scale real-world instances, based on data from the Italian postal company, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and provide managerial and practical insights."

These devices often integrate simple sensors, e.g. for temperature, light or humidity, etc. However, these smart but yet simple sensors can pose a sincere privacy risk. The sensor data enables sense-making of home attendance, domestic activities and even health conditions, often a fact that neither users nor developers are aware of or do not know how to address. Nevertheless, not all is lost or evil. This article makes a plea for how we, the ThingsCon community, might rethink smart connected things and services in our homes.

However, they are hampered by the unresolved origin of stellar Fe Kα lines: i.e., it is unclear which of the two mechanisms-photoionization by hard X-ray photons or collisional ionization by non-thermal electrons-is the dominant process. We present clear evidence for the photoionization origin based on simultaneous far ultraviolet (FUV) and soft X-ray observations of a superflare on the RS Canum Venaticorum-type Star UX Arietis with Extreme ultraviolet spetrosCope for ExosphEric Dynamic (EXCEED; 900$-$1480 Å) onboard Hisaki and Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER; 0.2$-$12 keV). The flare started at 22:50 UT on 2018 November 15 and released $2 \\times 10^{36}$ erg in the 900$-$1480 Å band and $3 \\times 10^{36}$ erg in the 0.3$-$4 keV band. The FUV emission, a proxy for non-thermal activity, peaked approximately 1.4 hours before the soft X-rays. In contrast, the Fe Kα line, detected at a statistical significance of $5.3 σ$ with an equivalent width of $67^{+28}_{-20}$ eV, peaked simultaneously with the thermal X-ray maximum rather than the non-thermal FUV peak-strongly supporting the photoionization hypothesis. Radiative transfer calculations, combined with the observed Fe Kα line intensity, further support the photoionization scenario and demonstrate the potential of this line to provide the flare geometry."

Our analysis demonstrates that the centrifuge field enables controlled excitation of high rotational states while maintaining relatively low spread along the vibrational coordinate. We contrast this to the rotational excitation by a linearly polarized Gaussian pulse of equal spectral width and pulse energy which, although comparable to the centrifuge-induced rotation, is unavoidably accompanied by a substantial broadening of the vibrational wavepacket."

We show that quantum-dot (QD) lasers can achieve stable single-mode lasing through a simple cavity design using dynamic population gratings (DPGs). Owing to the low lateral carrier diffusion of QDs, a strong standing-wave-induced carrier grating forms in a reverse-biased saturable absorber and provides self-aligned, mode-selective feedback not attainable in quantum-well devices. A single-ring laser achieves 46 dB side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR), while a dual-ring Vernier laser delivers ($>$ 46 nm) tuning range and up to 52.6 dB SMSR, with continuous-wave operation up to $80\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. The laser remains single-mode under $-10.6$ dB external optical feedback and supports isolator-free data transmission at 32 Gbps. These results establish DPG-enabled QD lasers as a simple and scalable route to tunable, feedback-resilient on-chip light sources for communication, sensing, and reconfigurable photonic systems."

Remarkably, for states non-invariant under parity we find Burgers equation arising in the hydrodynamic limit. We explicitly compute the diffusion constant and nonlinear Euler-scale coupling of the Burgers equation using a variant of the Chapman-Enskog theory. We find excellent agreement between our theory and numerical simulations of a simplified model of stochastic two-body collisions, which we call velocity swap models. Our conclusions are based only on Galilean invariance, existence of a small system-bath coupling parameter and a small momentum exchange between the system and the bath."

Optimization algorithms such as the gradient descent method can often be interpreted in the continuous-time limit as differential equations known as continuous dynamical systems. Analyzing the convergence rate of $f(x) - f_*$ in such systems often relies on constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions. However, these Lyapunov functions have been designed through heuristic reasoning rather than a systematic framework. Several studies have addressed this issue. In particular, Suh, Roh, and Ryu (2022) proposed a constructive approach that involves introducing dilated coordinates and applying integration by parts. Although this method significantly improves the process of designing Lyapunov functions, it still involves arbitrary choices among many possible options, and thus retains a heuristic nature in identifying Lyapunov functions that yield the best convergence rates. In this study, we propose a systematic framework for exploring these choices computationally. More precisely, we propose a brute-force approach using symbolic computation by computer algebra systems to explore every possibility. By formulating the design of Lyapunov functions for continuous dynamical systems as an optimization problem, we aim to optimize the Lyapunov function itself. As a result, our framework successfully reproduces many previously reported results and, in several cases, discovers new convergence rates that have not been shown in the existing studies."

A fundamental question is to identify e-merging functions, namely mappings that merge several e-values into a single valid e-value. A simple and elegant characterisation of this function class was recently obtained by Wang(2025), though via technically involved arguments. This note gives a short and intuitive geometric proof of the same characterisation, based on a supporting hyperplane argument applied to concave envelopes. We also show that the result holds even without imposing monotonicity in the definition of e-merging functions, which was needed for the existing proof. This shows that any non-monotone merging rule is automatically dominated by a monotone one, and hence extending the definition beyond the monotone case brings no additional generality."

In contrast, we show here the existence of a wide variety of objects that cannot be manipulated as desired, even with the optimal wavefront shaping protocol. The counterintuitive shapes of these objects are found using inverse design. Specifically, we show that the maximal pulling force is reduced by up to three orders of magnitude, and the maximal trapping stiffness is reduced by up to nearly two orders of magnitude. Our findings could prove useful in the development of micromachines that require a predictable mechanical reaction to an arbitrary wave."

    "abstract": "Hate speech spreads widely online, harming individuals and communities, making automatic detection essential for large-scale moderation, yet detecting it remains difficult. Part of the challenge lies in subjectivity: what one person flags as hate speech, another may see as benign. Traditional annotation agreement metrics, such as Cohen's $κ$, oversimplify this disagreement, treating it as an error rather than meaningful diversity. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) promise scalable annotation, but prior studies demonstrate that they cannot fully replace human judgement, especially in subjective tasks. In this work, we reexamine LLM reliability using a subjectivity-aware framework, cross-Rater Reliability (xRR), revealing that even under fairer lens, LLMs still diverge from humans. Yet this limitation opens an opportunity: we find that LLM-generated annotations can reliably reflect performance trends across classification models, correlating with human evaluations. We test this by examining whether LLM-generated annotations preserve the relative ordering of model performance derived from human evaluation (i.e. whether models ranked as more reliable by human annotators preserve the same order when evaluated with LLM-generated labels). Our results show that, although LLMs differ from humans at the instance level, they reproduce similar ranking and classification patterns, suggesting their potential as proxy evaluators. While not a substitute for human annotators, they might serve as a scalable proxy for evaluation in subjective NLP tasks."

This spread correlates with the stellar rotation period: systems with shorter periods exhibit significantly lower accretion rates, suggesting that they are undergoing at least temporary episodes of accretion bottleneck. We interpret this behaviour within the framework of magnetospheric accretion models, where the transition between steady accretion and the propeller regime is set by the relative locations of the co-rotation and magnetospheric radii. Our results indicate that stellar spin is a key parameter in regulating mass transfer from the disc to the star, and provide new evidence that the observed dispersion in $α$ reflects transitions between distinct accretion states rather than differences in global disc properties."

In addition to human annotations, the dataset includes scores generated by GPT-5 as an experiment on annotation automation.

We present a systematic overview of hadron emission in heavy-ion collisions across this entire energy range. The presented energy excitation functions of the approximated baryon and meson yields at mid-rapidity reflect the interplay between baryon stopping and particle production, both of which evolve continuously with increasing energy. At low energies (e.g., SIS18, AGS), strong nuclear stopping leads to high net-baryon densities at mid-rapidity and to the abundant formation of nuclear clusters. With increasing $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, the relative baryon stopping power $\\langle δy \\rangle / y_p$ decreases, and meson production becomes dominant. The inelasticity, i.e. the fraction of the initial kinetic energy available converted in inelastic reactions into particle production and dynamics, is found to rise rapidly at low energies and then levels off at values around $0.7 - 0.8$. While at low energies up to $\\sim 10$~GeV this available energy seems to be shared by equal amount between the production of new particles and the dynamics of the system, as well as radiation, the latter part starts to dominates at higher energies."

To this end, we introduce a structured data engineering process that converts raw videos from the MANIAC dataset into 27,476 statistical-kinematic feature vectors. Each vector encapsulates relational and dynamic properties from a short temporal window of motion. Our initial hypothesis posited that sequential modeling would be critical, leading us to compare static classifiers (MLPs) against temporal models (RNNs). Counter-intuitively, the key discovery occurred when we set the sequence length of a Bidirectional RNN to one (seq_length=1). This modification converted the network's function, compelling it to act as a high-capacity static feature encoder. This architectural change directly led to a significant accuracy improvement, culminating in a final score of 97.60%. Of particular note, our optimized model successfully overcame the most challenging transitional class, 'grabbing', by achieving a balanced F1-score of 0.90.

The constructed measures maximize the folding entropy, in particular, one may obtain such SRB measures for conservative perturbations of the examples given by M. Andersson, P. Carrasco and R.

    "abstract": "Observational evidence of extreme vertical velocities (|w| ge 12.5 m/s and at times greater than 50 m/s) in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT), has emerged in recent years. We refer to these events as Rogue Vertical Drafts (RVDs). They exceed five standard deviations of observed vertical velocities and appear as paired updraft-downdraft structures in varicose mode. Four-dimensional observations reveal that RVDs are intermittent, recurrent, and unpredictable. On average, they are expected to occur every sim 12 days during summer over Northern Norway, assuming a 1000 s interval. Different instruments may capture only portions of these events, for example, only upward or downward drafts when restricted to a single altitude range. Despite their rarity, their magnitudes and frequency suggest potential impacts on dust-sized matter escaping from planets, natural and anthropogenic space material, and MLT climate and processes. We propose that RVDs are a fundamental yet under-recognized feature of the MLT, underscoring the need for global observations to assess their prevalence and significance."

This paper presents a real-time feasible non-smooth model predictive control scheme for a physical three-tank process, implemented without mixed-integer formulations. The approach combines Filippov system modeling with finite elements and switch detection for time discretization, leading to a finite-dimensional optimal control problem formulated as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints. The mathematical program is solved via a homotopy of smooth nonlinear programs. We introduce modeling adjustments that make the three-tank dynamics numerically tractable, including additional modes to avoid non-Lipschitz points and undefined function values. Hardware experiments demonstrate efficient handling of switching events, mode-consistent tracking across reference changes, correct boundary handling, and constraint satisfaction. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of model mismatch and show that the tracking performance and computation times remain within real-time limits for the chosen sampling time. The complete controller is implemented using the non-smooth optimal control framework NOSNOC"

Although 4D radar is suited for such environments, its sparse and noisy point clouds hinder accurate odometry estimation, while the radar maps suffer from obscure and incomplete structures. Thus, we propose Super4DR, a 4D radar-centric framework for learning-based odometry estimation and gaussian-based map optimization. First, we design a cluster-aware odometry network that incorporates object-level cues from the clustered radar points for inter-frame matching, alongside a hierarchical self-supervision mechanism to overcome outliers through spatio-temporal consistency, knowledge transfer, and feature contrast. Second, we propose using 3D gaussians as an intermediate representation, coupled with a radar-specific growth strategy, selective separation, and multi-view regularization, to recover blurry map areas and those undetected based on image texture. Experiments show that Super4DR achieves a 67% performance gain over prior self-supervised methods, nearly matches supervised odometry, and narrows the map quality disparity with LiDAR while enabling multi-modal image rendering."

Second, a sufficiently weak exchange interaction ensures that the bright exciton remains energetically below the dark exciton state. We further show that the bright exciton ground state is stable under various mechanical strains and that trion states (charged excitons) inherit this bright ground state. Our findings are expected to spark further investigation into related materials that bring along the two key features mentioned, as bright ground-state excitons are crucial for applications requiring fast radiative recombination."

However, progress in sleep foundation models is hindered by two key limitations: (1) the lack of a shared dataset and benchmark with diverse tasks for training and evaluation, and (2) the absence of a systematic evaluation of SSRL approaches across sleep-related tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce Stanford Sleep Bench, a large-scale PSG dataset comprising 17,467 recordings totaling over 163,000 hours from a major sleep clinic, including 13 clinical disease prediction tasks alongside canonical sleep-related tasks such as sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, and age estimation. We systematically evaluate SSRL pre-training methods on Stanford Sleep Bench, assessing downstream performance across four tasks: sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, age estimation, and disease and mortality prediction. Our results show that multiple pretraining methods achieve comparable performance for sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, and age estimation. However, for mortality and disease prediction, contrastive learning significantly outperforms other approaches while also converging faster during pretraining. To facilitate reproducibility and advance sleep research, we will release Stanford Sleep Bench along with pretrained model weights, training pipelines, and evaluation code."

So far, ATAS has been implemented in pump-probe experiments where an attosecond extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) pump or probe pulse was combined with a near-infrared (NIR) pulse in the femtosecond range, with the attosecond time resolution deriving from sub-cycle NIR-driven dynamics. Investigations of ultrafast electron dynamics in atoms, molecules and solids, with potential impact across physics, chemistry, and biology, would benefit significantly from the ability to perform all-attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (AATAS). Here we demonstrate time-resolved AATAS using a table-top high-harmonic generation (HHG) source. The method is applied to investigate previously unresolved electronic coherences in Xe, revealing oscillatory valence hole motion with a 3-femtosecond period. In addition, systematic investigations of electron dynamics in Kr, Ar, and Ne are presented. Our work shows that, thanks to its broad bandwidth, high stability and easy accessibility, HHG is an ideal source for AATAS, offering the potential for replication in numerous laboratories."

In this paper, we compare different types of ViTs (pure, hierarchical, and hybrid) against traditional CNN models across various tasks, including object recognition, detection, and medical image classification. We conduct thorough tests on standard datasets like ImageNet for image classification and COCO for object detection. Additionally, we apply these models to medical imaging using the ChestX-ray14 dataset. We find that hybrid and hierarchical transformers, especially Swin and CvT, offer a strong balance between accuracy and computational resources. Furthermore, by experimenting with data augmentation techniques on medical images, we discover significant performance improvements, particularly with the Swin Transformer model. Overall, our results indicate that Vision Transformers are competitive and, in many cases, outperform traditional CNNs, especially in scenarios requiring the understanding of global visual contexts like medical imaging."

We reinterpret the noise schedule as a spectral regularizer and introduce power-law schedules $β(τ)\\!\\propto\\!τ^γ$ that preserve fine-scale structure deeper into diffusion time, along with \\emph{Lazy Diffusion}, a one-step distillation method that leverages the learned score geometry to bypass long reverse-time trajectories and prevent high-$k$ degradation. Applied to high-Reynolds-number 2D Kolmogorov turbulence and $1/12^\\circ$ Gulf of Mexico ocean reanalysis, these methods resolve spectral collapse, stabilize long-horizon autoregression, and restore physically realistic inertial-range scaling. Together, they show that naïve Gaussian scheduling is structurally incompatible with power-law physics and that physics-aware diffusion processes can yield accurate, efficient, and fully probabilistic surrogates for multiscale dynamical systems."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of low-altitude economy has placed higher demands on the sensing of small-sized unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) targets. However, the complex and dynamic low-altitude environment, like the urban and mountainous areas, makes clutter a significant factor affecting the sensing performance. Traditional clutter suppression methods based on Doppler difference or signal strength are inadequate for scenarios with dynamic clutter and slow-moving targets like low-altitude UAVs. In this paper, motivated by the concept of channel knowledge map (CKM), we propose a novel clutter suppression technique for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, by leveraging a new type of CKM named clutter angle map (CLAM). CLAM is a site-specific database, containing location-specific primary clutter angles for the coverage area of the ISAC base station (BS). With CLAM, the sensing signal components corresponding to the clutter environment can be effectively removed before target detection and parameter estimation, which greatly enhances the sensing performance. Besides, to take into account the scenarios when the targets and clutters are in close directions so that pure CLAM-based spatial domain clutter suppression is no longer effective, we further propose a two-step CLAM-enabled joint spatial-Doppler domain clutter suppression algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique effectively suppresses clutter and enhances target sensing performance, achieving accurate parameter estimation for sensing slow-moving low-altitude UAV targets."

Since $M_0$ is not an observable quantity, this normalisation hinders the direct applicability of the relations. A common remedy assumes that $M_0$ coincides with the actual mass of the star $M_S$; however, this approximation is only adequate for very slow rotation (when the dimensionless spin parameter is $χ_S<0.1$). The more accurate alternative approach, based on the $I$-Love-$Q$-$δM$ set of relations, circumvents this limitation by enabling the inference of $M_0$. Here we review both approaches and provide numerical comparisons."

By prescribing harmonic angular dynamics, the platform explores the phase space of angular velocity and acceleration $(Ω,\\,\\dotΩ)$, producing continuously varying centrifugal and Euler force fields that act as tunable body forces in our specimens. Image processing extracts beam kinematics with sub-pixel accuracy, enabling precise identification of snap-through events. By testing six beams in parallel, the platform allows systematic variation of beam thickness, pre-compression, tilt angle, and clamp orientations across 65 distinct configurations, generating 23,400 individual experiments. We construct stability boundaries and quantitatively parameterize them as parabolic functions, characterized by a vertical offset and a curvature parameter. Tilt angle provides the most robust mechanism for tuning the curvature parameter, while beam thickness and pre-compression modulate vertical offset. Modal decomposition analysis reveals that antisymmetric clamp configurations can trigger mode switching, in which competing geometric and inertial effects drive transitions through different deformation pathways. Our work establishes a scalable experimental framework for high-throughput characterization of dynamic nonlinear instabilities in mechanics. The complete experimental dataset is made publicly available to support data-driven design and machine learning models for nonlinear mechanics with applications to bistability-based metamaterials, mechanical memory, and electronics-free sensing systems."

Irradiation causes a linear increase in $ρ(T)$ and a decrease in the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ with dose $φ$. For small $φ$, the reduction of $T_c$ follows the Abrikosov--Gorkov (AG) pair-breaking theory, while for large $φ$ it is described by the Emery--Kivelson (EK) model, where quantum phase fluctuations dominate. At $φ_3 = 2.5 \\times 10^{19}$ e/cm$^2$, which corresponds to the AG--EK crossover, the spacing between CuO$_2$ planes $d_{01}$, the coherence length $ξ_c(0)$, and the fluctuation region $T_{\\mathrm{fl}}$ increase sharply, and the two-dimensional Maki--Thompson (2D--MT) contribution is replaced by the Aslamazov--Larkin (2D--AL) term. Surprisingly, no signatures of the crossover appear in $ρ(φ)$ or $T_c(φ)$. At the same $φ_3$, a sharp rise in the pseudogap opening temperature $T^{*}$ and in $Δ^{*}$ indicates a possible reduction of the density of states. With further increase in $φ$, both PG parameters and their energy scale decrease markedly, and $Δ^{*}(T)$ acquires an unusual form. However, at $φ_5 = 5.6 \\times 10^{19}$ e/cm$^2$, the temperature dependences of FLC and PG again show behavior typical of well-structured YBCO, regardless of defect density."

When a large number of auxiliary variables are included as calibration variables, the variance of the total estimator can increase, and the calibration weights can become highly dispersed. To address these issues, we propose a solution inspired by bagging and principal component decomposition. With our approach, the principal components of the auxiliary variables are constructed. Several samples of calibration variables are selected without replacement and with unequal probabilities from among the principal components. For each sample, a system of weights is obtained. The final weights are the average weights of these different weighting systems. With our proposed method, it is possible to calibrate exactly for some of the main auxiliary variables. For the other auxiliary variables, the weights cannot be calibrated exactly. The proposed method allows us to obtain a total estimator whose variance does not explode when new auxiliary variables are added and to obtain very low scatter weights. Finally, our proposed method allows us to obtain a single weighting system that can be applied to several variables of interest of a survey."

    "abstract": "The optimal transport (OT) map is a geometry-driven transformation between high-dimensional probability distributions which underpins a wide range of tasks in statistics, applied probability, and machine learning. However, existing statistical theory for OT map estimation is quite restricted, hinging on Brenier's theorem (quadratic cost, absolutely continuous source) to guarantee existence and uniqueness of a deterministic OT map, on which various additional regularity assumptions are imposed to obtain quantitative error bounds. In many real-world problems these conditions fail or cannot be certified, in which case optimal transportation is possible only via stochastic maps that can split mass. To broaden the scope of map estimation theory to such settings, this work introduces a novel metric for evaluating the transportation quality of stochastic maps. Under this metric, we develop computationally efficient map estimators with near-optimal finite-sample risk bounds, subject to easy-to-verify minimal assumptions. Our analysis further accommodates common forms of adversarial sample contamination, yielding estimators with robust estimation guarantees. Empirical experiments are provided which validate our theory and demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework in settings where existing theory fails. These contributions constitute the first general-purpose theory for map estimation, compatible with a wide spectrum of real-world applications where optimal transport may be intrinsically stochastic."

    "abstract": "The fundamental character of a fermionic dark matter, whether it is a Dirac or Majorana particle remains a key unresolved issue whose answer would profoundly affect dark-sector phenomenology and detection strategies thereby motivates complementary probes across particle and astrophysical experiments. Compact stars, particularly neutron stars, offer unique astrophysical laboratories for probing such fundamental properties under extreme densities. The presence of a fermionic DM admixed with nuclear matter can modify the equation of state, thereby affecting observable quantities such as the mass-radius (M-R) relation and tidal deformability. In this work, we investigate how the intrinsic particle nature of fermionic DM influences neutron star structure. Within a relativistic mean-field framework extended by a scalar (or Higgs like) portal coupling between DM and nucleons, we construct self-consistent equation of states for both Dirac and Majorana cases and solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to obtain stellar configurations. Owing to the difference in internal degrees of freedom, Dirac DM (four degrees of freedom) generally softens the equation of state more strongly than Majorana DM (two degrees of freedom), leading to smaller radii and lower maximum masses. We identify the parameter space consistent with current NICER and gravitational-wave constraints, highlighting the potential of compact-star observations to discriminate between Dirac and Majorana dark matter."

    "abstract": "Unequal representation of demographic groups in training data poses challenges to model generalisation across populations. Standard practice assumes that balancing subgroup representation optimises performance. However, recent empirical results contradict this assumption: in some cases, imbalanced data distributions actually improve subgroup performance, while in others, subgroup performance remains unaffected by the absence of an entire subgroup during training. We conduct a systematic study of subgroup allocation across four vision and language models, varying training data composition to characterise the sensitivity of subgroup performance to data balance. We propose the latent separation hypothesis, which states that a partially fine-tuned model's dependence on subgroup representation is determined by the degree of separation between subgroups in the latent space of the pre-trained model. We formalise this hypothesis, provide theoretical analysis, and validate it empirically. Finally, we present a practical application to foundation model fine-tuning, demonstrating that quantitative analysis of latent subgroup separation can inform data collection and balancing decisions."

    "abstract": "In this study, we investigate the $w$CDM dynamical dark energy model with spatial curvature utilizing the recently released DESI Collaboration data (DR1 and DR2) in conjunction with other observational probes such as BBN, Observational Hubble Data (OHD), and Pantheon Plus (PP). Our investigation attempts to discover which DESI dataset gives a better match to the $w$CDM framework and assess the impact of spatial curvature on cosmological constraints. We find that the cosmic curvature parameter, $Ω_k$, disfavors the cosmological constant for the DR2+BBN and DR2+BBN+OHD data combinations. However, the deviation from the cosmological constant remains below the $1σ$ level, indicating a mild preference for a open universe. In contrast, when using the DR1 based combinations namely DR1+BBN and DR1+BBN+OHD-the deviation from the cosmological constant increases to approximately $1.2σ$, suggesting a slightly stronger indication of a open geometry. Also, the best-fit values of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) obtained from the DR1+BBN+OHD+PP and DR2+BBN+OHD+PP combinations within the dynamical dark energy model are consistent with the results reported by the Planck Collaboration. Our findings provide constraints on the dark energy EoS parameter $ w_{\\mathrm{}0}$, reveal a mild but notable deviation from the vacuum energy ($w = -1$) scenario at a significance level $1.8σ$ from DR2+BBN+OHD+PP and $0.5σ$ from DR1+BBN+OHD+PP, both favoring the quintessence region of dark energy. Furthermore, the key physical distance measures $D_H$, $D_V$, and $D_M$ show better consistency with our model when analyzed with the DR2 data."

However, current practices often rely on manual data transcription and fragmented information systems, introducing potential risks to patient safety and operational efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a human-AI synergy system based on a cloud-edge-end architecture, which integrates visual-aware data extraction and semantic interaction mechanisms. Specifically, a visual-aware edge module non-invasively captures real-time physiological data from bedside monitors, reducing manual entry errors. To improve accessibility to fragmented data sources, a semantic interaction module, powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), enables physicians to perform efficient and intuitive voice-based queries over structured patient data. The hierarchical cloud-edge-end deployment ensures low-latency communication and scalable system performance. Our system reduces the cognitive burden on ICU nurses and physicians and demonstrates promising potential for broader applications in intelligent healthcare systems."

Existing multi-LLM serving systems optimize GPU utilization at the cost of worse inference performance, especially time-to-first-token (TTFT).

In contrast, recent analysis on real-world traces has shown the high periodicity and long-term predictability of LLM serving workloads. We propose universal GPU workers to enable one-for-many GPU prewarming that loads models with knowledge of future workloads. Based on universal GPU workers, we design and build WarmServe, a multi-LLM serving system that (1) mitigates cluster-wide prewarming interference by adopting an evict-aware model placement strategy, (2) prepares universal GPU workers in advance by proactive prewarming, and (3) manages GPU memory with a zero-overhead memory switching mechanism. Evaluation under real-world datasets shows that WarmServe improves TTFT by up to 50.8$\\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art autoscaling-based system, while being capable of serving up to 2.5$\\times$ more requests compared to the GPU-sharing system."

The approach employs learned visual transformations that obscure sensitive or task-irrelevant information while retaining features essential for task performance. Through both quantitative evaluation of the privacy-utility trade-off and qualitative feedback from industrial partners, we assess the framework's effectiveness, deployment feasibility, and trust implications. Results demonstrate that task-specific obfuscation enables effective monitoring with reduced privacy risks, establishing the framework's readiness for real-world adoption and providing cross-domain recommendations for responsible, human-centric AI deployment in industry."

Time-lapse imaging enables continuous, non-invasive monitoring of embryo development, yet most automated assessment methods rely solely on conventional morphokinetic features and overlook emerging biomarkers. Cytoplasmic Strings, thin filamentous structures connecting the inner cell mass and trophectoderm in expanded blastocysts, have been associated with faster blastocyst formation, higher blastocyst grades, and improved viability. However, CS assessment currently depends on manual visual inspection, which is labor-intensive, subjective, and severely affected by detection and subtle visual appearance. In this work, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first computational framework for CS analysis in human IVF embryos. We first design a human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline to curate a biologically validated CS dataset from TLI videos, comprising 13,568 frames with highly sparse CS-positive instances. Building on this dataset, we propose a two-stage deep learning framework that (i) classifies CS presence at the frame level and (ii) localizes CS regions in positive cases. To address severe imbalance and feature uncertainty, we introduce the Novel Uncertainty-aware Contractive Embedding (NUCE) loss, which couples confidence-aware reweighting with an embedding contraction term to form compact, well-separated class clusters. NUCE consistently improves F1-score across five transformer backbones, while RF-DETR-based localization achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection performance for thin, low-contrast CS structures.

Under ideal circumstances SISO narrow-band communication and TDD, the system may be viewed as a dual to a deep neural network, where activations, corresponding to repeater amplifications, are optimized and weight matrices, corresponding to channel matrices, are static. Repeater amplifications are locally optimized layer-by-layer in a forward-backward manner over compact sets. The method is applicable for a wide range of constraints on within-layer power/energy utilization, is furthermore gradient-free, step-size-free, and has proven monotonicity in the objective. Numerical simulations show significant improvement compared to upper bounds on the expected SNR. In addition, power distribution over multiple repeaters is shown to be superior to optimal selection of single repeaters in the layers."

Instead of deciding from a single descriptor comparison or using fixed thresholds with late-stage Iterative Closest Point (ICP) vetting, the verifier accumulates a short temporal stream of descriptor similarities between a query and each candidate. It then issues an accept/reject decision adaptively once sufficient multi-frame evidence has been observed, according to user-specified Type-I/II error design targets. This precision-first policy is designed to suppress false positives in structurally repetitive indoor environments. We evaluate the verifier on a five-sequence library dataset, using a fixed retrieval front-end with several representative LiDAR global descriptors. Performance is assessed via segment-level K-hit precision-recall and absolute trajectory error (ATE) and relative pose error (RPE) after pose graph optimization. Across descriptors, the sequential verifier consistently improves precision and reduces the impact of aliased loops compared with single-frame and heuristic multi-frame baselines.

The framework includes text encoding, contextual representation modeling, attention-based enhancement, feature aggregation, and classification prediction. In the representation stage, deep semantic embeddings are obtained through large-scale pretrained language models, and attention mechanisms are applied to enhance the selective representation of key features. In the aggregation stage, global and weighted strategies are combined to generate robust text-level vectors. In the classification stage, a fully connected layer and Softmax output are used to predict class distributions, and cross-entropy loss is employed to optimize model parameters. Comparative experiments introduce multiple baseline models, including recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks, and Transformers, and evaluate them on Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC. Results show that the proposed method outperforms existing models on all metrics, with especially strong improvements in Recall and AUC. In addition, sensitivity experiments are conducted on hyperparameters and data conditions, covering the impact of hidden dimensions on AUC and the impact of class imbalance ratios on Recall. The findings demonstrate that proper model configuration has a significant effect on performance and reveal the adaptability and stability of the model under different conditions. Overall, the proposed text classification method not only achieves effective performance improvement but also verifies its robustness and applicability in complex data environments through systematic analysis."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems have been widely deployed across various domains such as e-commerce and social media, and intelligently suggest items like products and potential friends to users based on their preferences and interaction history, which are often privacy-sensitive. Recent studies have revealed that recommender systems are prone to membership inference attacks (MIAs), where an attacker aims to infer whether or not a user's data has been used for training a target recommender system. However, existing MIAs fail to exploit the unique characteristic of recommender systems, and therefore are only applicable to mixed recommender systems consisting of two recommendation algorithms. This leaves a gap in investigating MIAs against hybrid-based recommender systems where the same algorithm utilizing user-item historical interactions and attributes of users and items serves and produces personalised recommendations. To investigate how the personalisation in hybrid-based recommender systems influences MIA, we propose a novel metric-based MIA. Specifically, we leverage the characteristic of personalisation to obtain reference recommendation for any target users. Then, a relative membership metric is proposed to exploit a target user's historical interactions, target recommendation, and reference recommendation to infer the membership of the target user's data. Finally, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed metric-based MIA on hybrid-based recommender systems."

    "abstract": "In causal inference, estimating the average treatment effect is a central objective, and in the context of competing risks data, this effect can be quantified by the cause-specific cumulative incidence function (CIF) difference. While doubly robust estimators give a more robust way to estimate the causal effect from the observational study, they remain inconsistent if both models are misspecified. To improve the robustness, we develop a multiply robust estimator for the difference in cause-specific CIFs using right-censored competing risks data. The proposed framework integrates the pseudo-value approach, which transforms the censored, time-dependent CIF into a complete-data outcome, with the multiply robust estimation framework. By specifying multiple candidate models for both the propensity score and the outcome regression, the resulting estimator is consistent and asymptotically unbiased, provided that at least one of the multiple propensity score or outcome regression models is correctly specified. Simulation studies show our multiply robust estimator remains virtually unbiased and maintains nominal coverage rates under various model misspecification scenarios and a wide range of choices for the censoring rate. Finally, the proposed multiply robust model is illustrated using the Right Heart Catheterization dataset."

Existing HBM-centric solutions do not exploit the characteristics of random-access-constrained memory (RACM) accelerators like Cambricon MLU370. We present ODMA, an on-demand memory allocation framework for RACM. ODMA addresses distribution drift and heavy-tailed requests by coupling a lightweight length predictor with dynamic bucket partitioning and a large-bucket safeguard. Boundaries are periodically updated from live traces to maximize utilization. On Alpaca and Google-NQ, ODMA improves prediction accuracy of prior work significantly (e.g., from 82.68% to 93.36%). Serving DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B on Cambricon MLU370-X4, ODMA raises memory utilization from 55.05% to 72.45% and improves RPS and TPS by 29% and 27% over static baselines.

    "abstract": "Functional reactive programming (FRP) is a declarative programming paradigm for implementing reactive programs at a high level of abstraction. It applies functional programming principles to construct and manipulate time-varying values, also known as signals. However, for this programming paradigm to work in practice, an FRP language must ensure that programs are causal, productive, and free from space leaks. Over the past fifteen years, several modal type systems to enforce these operational properties have been developed. We present a new FRP language with a significantly simplified modal type system that imposes fewer restrictions than previous modal FRP languages while still guaranteeing the central operational properties of causality, productivity, and absence of space leaks. The key enabling idea is to alter the semantics of signals so that the type system can safely allow more programs to type-check, which also makes the language more expressive. With this new semantics, signals are modelled as mutable references whose mutability is tightly controlled by the 'later' type modality. This disciplined form of mutability also enables more efficient in-place updates of signals, all while preserving a functional programming style."

In this paper, we propose Proof of Trusted Execution (PoTE), a consensus paradigm where agreement emerges from verifiable execution rather than replicated re-execution. Validators operate inside heterogeneous VM-based TEEs, each running the same canonical program whose measurement is publicly recorded, and each producing vendor-backed attestations that bind the enclave code hash to the block contents. Because the execution is deterministic and the proposer is uniquely derived from public randomness, PoTE avoids forks, eliminates slot.time bottlenecks, and commits blocks in a single round of verification. We present the design of a PoTE consensus client, describe our reference implementation, and evaluate its performance against the stringent throughput requirements of the Trillion decentralized exchange."

The present study includes all of the relevant tree-level Feynman diagrams, which contribute to these decays in the standard model. Our analysis shows that, for the charmonium final states, the fragmentation transition almost saturates the whole contribution and the other diagrams can be neglected; while for the bottomonium final states, the inclusion of other diagrams can increase their branching fractions by $4\\%\\sim 9\\%$. Further investigation of the differential distributions, especially the angular distributions, indicates that forward-backward asymmetries for final leptons in these processes would be zero in the standard model. Therefore, in future experimental facilities with large number of $Z$-boson events accumulated, studies of these rare $Z$ decays may help both to test the standard model and to probe its interesting extensions."

To this end, this paper proposes a novel Wasserstein-Aligned Hyperbolic (WAH) framework for multi-view clustering. Specifically, our method exploits a view-specific hyperbolic encoder for each view to embed features into the Lorentz manifold for hierarchical semantic modeling. Whereafter, a global semantic loss based on the hyperbolic sliced-Wasserstein distance is introduced to align manifold distributions across views. This is followed by soft cluster assignments to encourage cross-view semantic consistency. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarking datasets show that our method can achieve SOTA clustering performance."

    "abstract": "We propose and experimentally demonstrate an orbital angular momentum (OAM) nanolaser array arranged in a ring geometry on an InP-based photonic crystal membrane. The device realizes a non-Hermitian extension of the Rice-Mele model, featuring alternating coupling strengths and imaginary on-site detunings. This configuration supports a symmetry-protected zero mode stabilized by non-Hermitian particle-hole symmetry, which enforces a uniform $π/2$ phase shift between adjacent nanolasers, establishing a coherent phase winding around the array. By adjusting the gain/loss contrast in a parity-time (PT)-like pumping scheme, the system can be tuned to a chiral exceptional point, where energy flows unidirectionally between nanocavities despite their reciprocal coupling. This symmetry-enforced, directional tunneling leads to far-field emission carrying non-zero OAM, providing a direct signature of the phase-structured lasing mode. Our results demonstrate a robust and scalable strategy for engineering compact, phase-locked laser arrays with controllable angular momentum output, and open new avenues for structured light generation in integrated photonic platforms."

    "abstract": "We present a systematic investigation of 1,481 Galactic open clusters (OCs) through the application of the Limepy dynamical model, from which we derive the fundamental structural parameters of OCs. We conduct the statistical analyses on the structural parameters with clusters' ages and locations within the Milky Way. Our results reveal the higher concentration in the cluster centeris associated with the sharper truncation at the periphery of cluster, which is consistent with previous findings for globular clusters(GCs). We further find the systematic increase of the lower limit of clusters' half-mass radius (Rh) with age. Our results also show that OCs located at larger vertical distances from the Galactic plane systematically display higher central concentrations. Our findings collectively suggest that the structural characteristics of OCs are shaped by both intrinsic evolutionary processes and interactions with the Galactic environment. During the evolution of star clusters, the combined effects of mass segregation and tidal stripping lead to the systematic pattern between central concentration and outer truncation. Clusters of different ages and locations within the Milky Way undergo different evolutionary histories, resulting in correlations between the Rh and age, as well as between central concentration and galactic location."

    "abstract": "Cooperative suspended aerial transportation is highly susceptible to multi-source disturbances such as aerodynamic effects and thrust uncertainties. To achieve precise load manipulation, existing methods often rely on extra sensors to measure cable directions or the payload's pose, which increases the system cost and complexity. A fundamental question remains: is the payload's pose observable under multi-source disturbances using only the drones' odometry information? To answer this question, this work focuses on the two-drone-bar system and proves that the whole system is observable when only two or fewer types of lumped disturbances exist by using the observability rank criterion. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present such a conclusion and this result paves the way for more cost-effective and robust systems by minimizing their sensor suites. Next, to validate this analysis, we consider the situation where the disturbances are only exerted on the drones, and develop a composite disturbance filtering scheme. A disturbance observer-based error-state extended Kalman filter is designed for both state and disturbance estimation, which renders improved estimation performance for the whole system evolving on the manifold $(\\mathbb{R}^3)^2\\times(TS^2)^3$. Our simulation and experimental tests have validated that it is possible to fully estimate the state and disturbance of the system with only odometry information of the drones."

    "abstract": "Predicting molecule-protein interactions (MPIs) is a fundamental task in computational biology, with crucial applications in drug discovery and molecular function annotation. However, existing MPI models face two major challenges. First, the scarcity of labeled molecule-protein pairs significantly limits model performance, as available datasets capture only a small fraction of biological relevant interactions. Second, most methods rely solely on molecular and protein features, ignoring broader biological context such as genes, metabolic pathways, and functional annotations that could provide essential complementary information. To address these limitations, our framework first aggregates diverse biological datasets, including molecular, protein, genes and pathway-level interactions, and then develop an optimal transport-based approach to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for unlabeled molecule-protein pairs, leveraging the underlying distribution of known interactions to guide label assignment. By treating pseudo-labeling as a mechanism for bridging disparate biological modalities, our approach enables the effective use of heterogeneous data to enhance MPI prediction. We evaluate our framework on multiple MPI datasets including virtual screening tasks and protein retrieval tasks, demonstrating substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracies and zero shot ability across unseen interactions. Beyond MPI prediction, our approach provides a new paradigm for leveraging diverse biological data sources to tackle problems traditionally constrained by single- or bi-modal learning, paving the way for future advances in computational biology and drug discovery."

In contrast, an e-geodesic update has a practical advantage in cases where the parameter space is geodesically complete, allowing optimization without explicitly handling parameter constraints. We establish the theoretical properties of the proposed methods and validate their effectiveness through numerical experiments."

To tackle this issue, we propose a bandwidth-efficient semantic communication paradigm termed Non-Orthogonal Codewords for Semantic Communication (NOC4SC), which enables simultaneous same-frequency transmission without spectrum spreading. By leveraging the Swin Transformer, the proposed NOC4SC framework enables each user to independently extract semantic features through a unified encoder-decoder architecture with shared network parameters across all users, which ensures that the user's data remains protected from unauthorized decoding. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive NOC and SNR Modulation (NSM) block, which employs deep learning to dynamically regulate SNR and generate approximately orthogonal semantic features within distinct feature subspaces, thereby effectively mitigating inter-user interference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed NOC4SC achieves comparable performance to the DeepJSCC-PNOMA and outperforms other multi-user SemCom baseline methods."

    "abstract": "Bimetric MOND (BIMOND) is used as a platform for variable-$G$ theories that have MOND-specific idiosyncrasies. E.g., MOND premises dictate return to standard dynamics in the high-acceleration limit, predicting the standard value of $G$ for high-acceleration systems. This automatically ensures compliance of such theories with all the constraints on inconstancy of $G$ that emerge from the study of high-acceleration systems: geophysics, solar system, pulsars, supernovae, stellar evolution, emission of gravitational waves, etc. In MOND, constraints deduced from such phenomena have no bearing on possible $G$ variability in cosmology. My guiding motivation is to see if such theories may account for some roles of dark matter in cosmology; e.g., in accounting for the expansion history of the Universe in the matter-dominated era, by having a $G_e\\approx 2πG$ govern the later stages of the expansion, instead of invoking matter density $\\approx 2π\\times$ baryon density. Without adding degrees of freedom, or new dimensionful constants, BIMOND can be extended to a class of theories that entail what is best described as phenomenon-dependence of Newton's constant, $G$. I cannot yet present a consistent model that complies with all the observations in cosmology, including the expansion history, with all its details. Instead, I describe some examples of theories in the class that predict different values of $G_e$ in different circumstances, including one where $G$ takes its standard value for all subcosmological systems -- even if they are deep in the MOND regime. I also discuss scenarios in which $G_e\\approx G$ in the early Universe, as required by constraints from big-bang nucleosynthesis, but with $G_e> G$ setting in at later times, where it can affect the expansion history during the matter-dominated era."

However, recent human and non-human primate research suggests the existence of a third visual pathway projecting from early visual cortex through the motion-selective area V5/MT into the superior temporal sulcus (STS). Here we integrate anatomical, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological evidence demonstrating that this pathway specializes in processing dynamic social cues such as facial expressions, eye gaze, and body movements. This third pathway supports social perception by computing the actions and intentions of other people. These findings enhance our understanding of visual cortical organization and highlight the STS's critical role in social cognition, suggesting that visual processing encompasses a dedicated neural circuit for interpreting socially relevant motion and behavior."

While recent methods leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through supervised learning on large-scale datasets to improve reasoning, they often lack robustness in novel scenarios. Conversely, reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches enhance adaptability but remain data-inefficient and lack transparent decision-making. % contribution To address these limitations, we propose COVLM-RL, a novel end-to-end driving framework that integrates Critical Object-oriented (CO) reasoning with VLM-guided RL. Specifically, we design a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategy that enables the VLM to reason over critical traffic elements and generate high-level semantic decisions, effectively transforming multi-view visual inputs into structured semantic decision priors. These priors reduce the input dimensionality and inject task-relevant knowledge into the RL loop, accelerating training and improving policy interpretability. However, bridging high-level semantic guidance with continuous low-level control remains non-trivial. To this end, we introduce a consistency loss that encourages alignment between the VLM's semantic plans and the RL agent's control outputs, enhancing interpretability and training stability. Experiments conducted in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that COVLM-RL significantly improves the success rate by 30\\% in trained driving environments and by 50\\% in previously unseen environments, highlighting its strong generalization capability."

The efficient influence function-based estimator (EIF-based estimator) and the inverse probability weighting estimator (IPW estimator), which are standard in causal mediation analysis, both rely on the inverse of the estimated propensity scores, and thus they are vulnerable to two key issues (i) instability and (ii) finite-sample covariate imbalance. We propose estimators based on the weights obtained by an algorithm that directly penalizes weight dispersion while enforcing approximate covariate and mediator balance, thereby improving stability and mitigating bias in finite samples. We establish the convergence rates of the proposed weights and show that the resulting estimators are asymptotically normal and achieve the semiparametric efficiency bound. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms not only the EIF-based estimator and the IPW estimator but also the regression imputation estimator in challenging scenarios with model misspecification. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to a real dataset from a study examining the effects of media framing on immigration attitudes."

Here we study how network connectivity both limits and enables information processing by analyzing random networks across the structural percolation transition. Using cascade-mediated dynamics as a minimal and universal mechanism for propagating state-dependent responses, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree in Erdos-Renyi networks. We find that the emergence of a giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow quantified by transfer entropy extends beyond local neighborhoods. These coincident transitions define a regime of functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the structural percolation transition. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality provides a universal organizing principle for information processing in systems with local interactions and propagating influences."

Groups that begin with an early majority of above-norm contributors (about 60%) are very likely finish high.

To address these issues, we propose RACAM, the first in-DRAM bit-serial architecture which uses dedicated locality buffers, bit-serial PEs, popcount reduction units and broadcast units to enable data reuse and alleviate redundant data transfers. Furthermore, a workload mapping mechanism is proposed to fully explore the massive parallelism of DRAM architecture and identify the best mapping scheme of a given workload. We evaluate RACAM against GPUs and the state-of-the-art, in-DRAM PIM system, Proteus, across end-to-end LLM inferences. RACAM achieves 9x to 102x speedup over GPUs and 233x higher performance per mm2 compared to Proteus in case of GPT3."

We curate a dataset of student essays and assess 16 different detection systems for bias across four attributes: gender, race/ethnicity, English-language learner (ELL) status, and economic status. We evaluate these attributes using regression-based models to determine the significance and power of the effects, as well as performing subgroup analysis. We find that while biases are generally inconsistent across systems, there are several key issues: several models tend to classify disadvantaged groups as machine-generated, ELL essays are more likely to be classified as machine-generated, economically disadvantaged students' essays are less likely to be classified as machine-generated, and non-White ELL essays are disproportionately classified as machine-generated relative to their White counterparts. Finally, we perform human annotation and find that while humans perform generally poorly at the detection task, they show no significant biases on the studied attributes."

In this work, we continue this endeavor by systematically investigating the contact contributions originating from dim-9 LEFT operators. We construct a complete basis of dim-9 operators relevant to these processes, and subsequently match them onto chiral perturbation theory to calculate their decay widths. By employing existing experimental data, we derive stringent constraints on the relevant operators.

We initiate the study of such intent inference using a variant of a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF), subject to the assumption that the agent's intent manifests through closed-loop behavior with a state-of-the-art provable practical stability property. Leveraging the assumed closed-form agent dynamics, the RBPF analytically marginalizes the linear-Gaussian substructure and updates particle weights only, improving sample efficiency over a standard particle filter. Two difference estimators are introduced: a Gaussian mixture model using the RBPF weights and a reduced version confining the mixture to the effective sample. We quantify how well the adversary can recover the agent's intent using information-theoretic leakage metrics and provide computable lower bounds on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the true intent distribution and RBPF estimates via Gaussian-mixture KL bounds. We also provide a bound on the difference in performance between the two estimators, highlighting the fact that the reduced estimator performs almost as well as the complete one. Experiments illustrate fast and accurate intent recovery for compliant agents, motivating future work on designing intent-obfuscating controllers."

    "abstract": "Batch effects pose a significant challenge in the analysis of single-cell omics data, introducing technical artifacts that confound biological signals. While various computational methods have achieved empirical success in correcting these effects, they lack the formal theoretical guarantees required to assess their reliability and generalization. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mixture-Model-based Data Harmonization (MoDaH), a principled batch correction algorithm grounded in a rigorous statistical framework. Under a new Gaussian-mixture-model with explicit parametrization of batch effects, we establish the minimax optimal error rates for batch correction and prove that MoDaH achieves this rate by leveraging the recent theoretical advances in clustering data from anisotropic Gaussian mixtures. This constitutes, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical guarantee for batch correction. Extensive experiments on diverse single-cell RNA-seq and spatial proteomics datasets demonstrate that MoDaH not only attains theoretical optimality but also achieves empirical performance comparable to or even surpassing those of state-of-the-art heuristics (e.g., Harmony, Seurat-V5, and LIGER), effectively balancing the removal of technical noise with the conservation of biological signal."

Van der Waals (vdW) materials offer exceptional optical properties, including high refractive indices and giant anisotropy, but their implementation is constrained by the small area and uncontrolled thickness of mechanically exfoliated flakes. Here, we demonstrate that atomic layer deposition (ALD) grown gallium sulfide (GaS) overcomes the trade-off between high optical performance and manufacturability, emerging as a large-scale vdW dielectric platform. Through rigorous optical and structural benchmarking against pristine single crystals, we establish that the optical constants (n, k) of ALD-GaS are virtually indistinguishable from single-crystal counterparts. By leveraging the retained out-of-plane anisotropy, we demonstrate that ALD-GaS enables superior suppression of crosstalk in densely integrated waveguides compared to conventional scalable high-index platforms. Our findings establish ALD-GaS as a technologically viable pathway for implementing anisotropic vdW materials in visible-spectrum photonics."

Owing to its substantial contribution to worldwide morbidity and mortality, the development of reliable and efficient diagnostic approaches is critically important to facilitate early detection and prompt clinical management. This study presents a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for early CKD detection from CT kidney images, complemented by class balancing using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and interpretability via Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). The model was trained and evaluated on the CT KIDNEY DATASET, which contains 12,446 CT images, including 3,709 cyst, 5,077 normal, 1,377 stone, and 2,283 tumor cases. The proposed deep CNN achieved a remarkable classification performance, attaining 100% accuracy in the early detection of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This significant advancement demonstrates strong potential for addressing critical clinical diagnostic challenges and enhancing early medical intervention strategies."

This SN showed additional optical emissions, which were found to exhibit 12.4-day periodic undulations and concordant periodic velocity shifts. These key features likely indicate a compact object in a binary system was formed. A faint $γ$-ray source was also detected at the position of the SN and upon checking the $γ$-ray photons' arrival times, it was revealed that the same 12.4-day periodicity was likely present. Here we report our detailed analysis results for the $γ$-ray source. Not only was the $γ$-ray emission detectable for $\\sim$1.5\\,years since the discovery time, but a strong modulation at period 12.5\\,day was also clearly determined. Considering the newly formed compact object to be a neutron star or a stellar-mass black hole, the putative binary, having an orbital period of 12.5\\,day, is likely the first extragalactic high-energy system detected. The system may serve as a valuable example for the formation of many such binaries observed in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies."

    "abstract": "We present a simple randomized algorithm that can efficiently maintain a $(Δ+1)$ coloring as the graph undergoes edge insertion and deletion updates, where $Δ$ denotes an upper bound on the maximum degree. A key advantage is the algorithm's ability to process many updates simultaneously, which makes it naturally adaptable to the parallel and distributed models. Concretely, it gives a unified framework across the models, leading to the following results: - In the sequential setting, the algorithm processes each update in $O(1)$ expected time, worst-case. This matches and strengthens the results of Henzinger and Peng [TALG 2022] and Bhattacharya et al. [TALG 2022], who achieved an $O(1)$ bound but amortized (in expectation and with high probability, respectively), whose work was an improvement of the $O(\\log Δ)$ expected amortized bound of Bhattacharya et al. [SODA'18]. - In the parallel setting, the algorithm processes each (arbitrary size) batch of updates using $O(1)$ work per update in the batch in expectation, and in $\\text{poly}(\\log n)$ depth with high probability. This is, in a sense, an ideal parallelization of the above results. - In the distributed setting, the algorithm can maintain a coloring of the network graph as (potentially many) edges are added or deleted. The maintained coloring is always proper; it may become partial upon updates, i.e., some nodes may temporarily lose their colors, but quickly converges to a full, proper coloring. Concretely, each insertion and deletion causes at most $O(1)$ nodes to become uncolored, but this is resolved within $O(\\log n)$ rounds with high probability (e.g., in the absence of further updates nearby--the precise guarantee is stronger, but technical). Importantly, the algorithm incurs only $O(1)$ expected message complexity and computation per update."

    "abstract": "Reward-model-based fine-tuning is a central paradigm in aligning Large Language Models with human preferences. However, such approaches critically rely on the assumption that proxy reward models accurately reflect intended supervision, a condition often violated due to annotation noise, bias, or limited coverage. This misalignment can lead to undesirable behaviors, where models optimize for flawed signals rather than true human values. In this paper, we investigate a novel framework to identify and mitigate such misalignment by treating the fine-tuning process as a form of knowledge integration. We focus on detecting instances of proxy-policy conflicts, cases where the base model strongly disagrees with the proxy. We argue that such conflicts often signify areas of shared ignorance, where neither the policy nor the reward model possesses sufficient knowledge, making them especially susceptible to misalignment. To this end, we propose two complementary metrics for identifying these conflicts: a localized Proxy-Policy Alignment Conflict Score (PACS) and a global Kendall-Tau Distance measure. Building on this insight, we design an algorithm named Selective Human-in-the-loop Feedback via Conflict-Aware Sampling (SHF-CAS) that targets high-conflict QA pairs for additional feedback, refining both the reward model and policy efficiently. Experiments on two alignment tasks demonstrate that our approach enhances general alignment performance, even when trained with a biased proxy reward. Our work provides a new lens for interpreting alignment failures and offers a principled pathway for targeted refinement in LLM training."

    "abstract": "We report a symmetry-resolved study of longitudinal magnetoelastoresistance (MER) in the multivalley material bismuth, with the current, uniaxial stress, and magnetic field all applied along the binary axis. The magnitude of MER exhibits a steep increase at low magnetic fields, reaches a peak, and then gradually decreases at higher fields. By decomposing the strain response into symmetric and antisymmetric symmetry channels, we reveal contrasting magnetic field dependencies. Despite the overall non-monotonic field dependence of the MER, the symmetric component remains nearly constant under magnetic fields, suggesting that the valleys in bismuth preserve a rigid-band nature against strain even in the presence of a magnetic field. In contrast, the antisymmetric component, associated with mobility anisotropy, dominates the MER response in a magnetic field. At low magnetic fields, the applied field effectively modifies the apparent mobility of each valley, leading to an enhancement in the magnitude of the antisymmetric MER. At higher fields, field-induced valley polarization further modifies this mobility anisotropy by altering the contributions from each valley's mobility, accounting for the moderate suppression of the MER. These findings demonstrate that symmetry-resolved MER serves as a powerful probe of valley-dependent electronic states and provides a fundamental platform for understanding the interplay between magnetic field, strain, and charge transport."

    "abstract": "Non-thermal plasma (NTP) surface activation has become a powerful and versatile strategy to engineer the interfacial properties of biomedical polymers whose intrinsic hydrophobicity limits their biological performance. In polymers such as polylactic acid (PLA) and polycarbonate (PC), NTP promotes the controlled incorporation of polar functional groups, increases surface energy, modifies dielectric behavior, and generates micro-roughness that collectively enhance protein adsorption and early cell adhesion. This review synthesizes and critically evaluates evidence across four complementary analytical pillars-contact-angle theory, dielectric impedance spectroscopy, FT-IR chemical mapping, and optical microscopy-to construct an integrated framework for interpreting plasma-induced chemical and morphological transformations. The convergence of multimodal results demonstrates that NTP consistently produces chemically active, polar, and moderately textured surfaces that support robust initial cell-material interactions. Furthermore, combining wettability, dielectric, and spectroscopic analysis enables the identification of activation pathways, the assessment of hydrophobic recovery dynamics, and the development of quantitative correlations between dielectric parameters and biological response. However, the literature also reveals key methodological gaps, including the limited use of unified multimodal protocols, insufficient evaluation of temporal stability, and a lack of predictive dielectric-biological models. By articulating these advances and limitations within a unified conceptual scheme, this review provides a roadmap for future research aimed at standardizing characterization workflows and enabling the rational design of next-generation plasma-functionalized biomaterials for tissue-engineering scaffolds, implantable devices, and advanced drug-delivery systems."

We obtain full characterizations of the classes of insurance indemnity functions that correspond to weak and strong risk aversion. Risk-insurance parity allows us to define two new notions of risk aversion, between weak and strong, characterized by insurance propensity to deductible-only and limit-only contracts respectively."

The central idea is to perform a Galerkin projection of the transition operator to a suitable set of low-order bases that capture the correlations between the dimensions. Such a discretized operator can be obtained from moments corresponding to our choice of basis without curse of dimensionality. Furthermore, by exploiting its low-rank structure and the spatial decay of correlations, we can obtain a compressed representation with computational complexity of order $\\mathcal{O}(dN)$, where $d$ is the dimensionality and $N$ is the sample size. We further theoretically analyze the approximation error of the proposed compressed representation. We numerically demonstrate that the learned operator allows efficient prediction of future events and solving high-dimensional boundary value problems. This gives rise to a simple linear algebraic method for high-dimensional rare-events simulations."

Hole-doped kagome compounds exhibit puzzling double-dome superconductivity and, as chemical substitution inevitably introduces quenched disorder, their properties remain poorly understood. Here, by leveraging the sensitivity of nuclear quadrupole resonance to local and static orderings, we uncover new features, primarily the incipient and fragmented CDW phases, in the charge landscape of CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$. Static CDW puddles are observed well above the transition temperature, a hallmark of pinning by defects. Their doping and temperature evolution indicate that, in the absence of disorder, the inverse Star-of-David $π$-shifted (ISD-$π$) CDW order would vanish near $x=0.12$, between the two superconducting domes. This critical doping represents a hidden quantum critical point. Nevertheless, the ISD-$π$ pattern persists well beyond previous reports, although its volume fraction is progressively reduced up to the critical doping at which it saturates. We establish that carrier doping promotes fragmentation of the ISD-$π$ order, whereas randomness preserves the ISD-$π$ patches."

Recent advances in the field demand simulation frameworks that combine physical accuracy, computational scalability, and seamless integration with modern control and optimization pipelines. In this work, we present Py-DiSMech, a Python-based, open-source simulation framework for modeling and control of soft robotic structures grounded in the principles of Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG). By discretizing geometric quantities such as curvature and strain directly on meshes, Py-DiSMech captures the nonlinear deformation of rods, shells, and hybrid structures with high fidelity and reduced computational cost. The framework introduces (i) a fully vectorized NumPy implementation achieving order-of-magnitude speed-ups over existing geometry-based simulators; (ii) a penalty-energy-based fully implicit contact model that supports rod-rod, rod-shell, and shell-shell interactions; (iii) a natural-strain-based feedback-control module featuring a proportional-integral (PI) controller for shape regulation and trajectory tracking; and (iv) a modular, object-oriented software design enabling user-defined elastic energies, actuation schemes, and integration with machine-learning libraries. Benchmark comparisons demonstrate that Py-DiSMech substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art simulator Elastica in computational efficiency while maintaining physical accuracy. Together, these features establish Py-DiSMech as a scalable, extensible platform for simulation-driven design, control validation, and sim-to-real research in soft robotics."

    "abstract": "Dark energy (DE) models with many free parameters are often considered excessive, as constraining all parameters poses a significant challenge. On the other hand, such models offer greater flexibility to probe the DE sector in more detail. With the rapid advancement of astronomical surveys and the availability of diverse datasets, it is timely to examine whether current combined observations can effectively constrain an extended parameter space in DE models. This article investigates a four-parameter dynamical dark energy (DDE) model that spans a broad region of the universe's expansion history through four key parameters: the present-day value of the DE equation of state ($w_0$), its initial value ($w_m$), the scale factor depicting transition from $w_m$ to $w_0$ occurs ($a_t$), and the steepness of this transition ($Δ_{\\rm de}$). We constrain the model using CMB data from Planck, BAO from DESI DR2, and three distinct compilations of Type Ia Supernovae: PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3. Our results show that constraining all four parameters remains difficult: $a_t$ is not constrained by any dataset, while the remaining three parameters can be constrained only when all observational probes are combined (with the exception of DESY5). The results further show that DE has a quintessential nature at present ($w_0 > -1$), while $w_m$ is negative, indicating a phantom-like behaviour at early times. Interestingly, despite its larger parameter space, the proposed DDE model is preferred over the $Λ$CDM scenario, based on both $Δχ^2$ and Bayesian evidence, for certain combined datasets, particularly CMB+BAO+DESY5 and CMB+BAO+Union3."

As key tracers of hierarchical structure formation, subhalos are among the most important objects within these simulations.

Here, we extend the CWT framework to subhalo identification by adapting the CWTHF (Continuous Wavelet Transform Halo Finder) code. This extension extends the unbinding procedure, which enables the reliable identification of gravitationally bound substructures. The algorithm identifies density peaks within known halos or subhalos and segments the surrounding volume accordingly. Once a new subhalo is registered, its position is recorded to prevent duplicate detection. We validate our approach using the TNG50-2 and TNG100-1 simulations, as well as a single Friends-of-Friends (FOF) halo, by comparing the resulting CWT catalog against the reference SUBFIND catalog. Because the method inherits the original computational framework, our subhalo finder maintains a favorable linear time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(N)$."

Here we analyze the eigenspectrum of the Jacobian matrices associated to a general class of networked dynamical systems, which contains information on how perturbations to a stationary state develop over time. We find that stability is always determined by a spectral outlier, but with pronounced differences to the corresponding eigenvector in different regimes. We show that, depending on model details, instability may originate in nodes of anomalously low or high degree, or may occur everywhere in the network at once. Importantly, the dependence on extremal degrees results in considerable finite-size effects with different scaling depending on the ensemble degree distribution. Our results have potentially useful applications in network monitoring to predict or prevent catastrophic failures, and we validate our analytical findings through applications to epidemic dynamics and gene regulatory systems."

    "abstract": "Optical reconfigurable intelligent reflecting surface (ORIS), as a new type of programmable optical communication device, can intelligently reconstruct the optical channel environment, which has attracted widespread attention. In existing optical wireless communication (OWC) scenarios, ORIS can be used to build parallel transmission channels in addition to the direct path to improve system performance. However, the existing ORIS-assisted free space optical communication (FSO) systems only use two frame transmission schemes, namely, repeated transmission scheme (RTS) and parallel transmission scheme (PTS). Both schemes have obvious disadvantages in terms of performance and robustness. To address the above issues, we pro pose an improved adaptive frame transmission scheme (AFTS) for cooperative ORIS-assisted FSO systems. The proposed AFTS has adaptive error correction and anti-interruption capabilities, which can prevent frame information from being lost when sudden conditions occur in the channel. It is shown that, both analytically and numerically, the proposed AFTS can increase the frame transmission rate while maintaining a low frame error rate (FER), thereby improving the system's performance and robustness."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution for collaborative model training in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), enabling vehicle clients (VCs) to learn shared models without exchanging raw data. However, data redundancy and imbalance in IoV environments often lead to biased updates and degraded generalization, primarily due to ineffective participant selection. This paper proposes an efficient FL framework that addresses these challenges through an informed VC selection strategy. A novel similarity metric is introduced based on VC-side logits to quantify data distribution similarity with minimal computational and communication overhead. Leveraging this metric, a Louvain-based algorithm is designed to group VCs with diverse data distributions and enable balanced, representative VC selection. The proposed method effectively reduces data redundancy, mitigates the impact of non-IID distributions, accelerates convergence, and enhances model accuracy. Experimental results on FMNIST, CIFAR-10, and the IoV-specific GTSRB dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces communication rounds compared to state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability in realistic IoV scenarios."

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology has gained widespread recognition for its ability to significantly enhance communication performance between base stations (BS) and users in blind spot areas. This paper investigates the energy efficiency (EE) of an RIS-assisted multi-cell communication system, incorporating a measurement-based empirical RIS power consumption model. Exploiting only statistical channel state information (CSI), we aim to maximize the overall EE of the system. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed for joint optimization of the transmit beamforming vectors at the BSs and the RIS phase shift matrix. To circumvent the challenges arising from the discrete relationship between the power consumption of positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) diode-based reflecting elements and their phase shifts, we introduce a continuous function to approximate the relationship. With this approximation, the complex circle manifold (CCM) technique is applied to optimize the continuous RIS phase shifts, which are then quantized within a discrete set. Then, to further reduce the complexity of the AO algorithm, a sub-optimal algorithm is proposed. In this algorithm, the statistical maximum ratio transmission beamforming is employed at each BS, which decouples the design of BS beamforming vectors from the design of BS transmit power and RIS phase shifts. Given the BS beamforming vectors, the BS transmit power and RIS phase shifts are then designed using the quadratic transformation and CCM techniques. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal EE while offering guidance on PIN diode encoding to balance phase resolution and power consumption in practical RIS design."

    "abstract": "Covert wireless communication ensures both information confidentiality and transmission untraceability, which is increasingly vital for mission-critical extended reality (XR) services. While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide mobility and flexible coverage, and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) enable energy-efficient signal manipulation, their joint use for covert communications has not yet been sufficiently explored. This paper proposes a novel UAV-mounted IRS system for covert communications that passively reflects source signals toward a legitimate receiver while minimizing detection by an adversary warden. In contrast to previous work that treats trajectory design, beamforming, and power control in isolation, the proposed work develops a unified framework based on double deep Q-networks (DDQN) to jointly optimize the UAV trajectory, power allocation, and IRS phase shifts under covert constraints. We analytically derive the optimal detection threshold and the minimum detection error probability, which are dynamically integrated into the learning framework. The optimization problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process, which allows the agent to adaptively learn optimal policies in dynamic environments without relying on perfect channel knowledge. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves covert rate and energy efficiency compared with the iterative and random benchmark schemes, while also providing insights into the impact of system parameters on performance."

    "abstract": "In vehicular cooperative perception (CP), numerous resource allocation strategies have been proposed to enhance urban autonomous driving. However, existing studies often overlook the competition between self-perception and cooperative perception, where degrading a ground vehicle's (GV's) self-perception may introduce safety risks and reduce passenger comfort. Moreover, UAV–GV cooperation—which can improve sensing precision, reduce task execution delay, and enhance CP service availability—has received limited attention. It is worth noting that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are unavailable for cooperative perception during the recharging process. To address these issues, this paper investigates on-demand scheduling strategy in UAV–GV cooperative perception. At the millisecond timescale, resource competition is considered in real-time sensing, communication, and computation (SC<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) resource allocation. At the minute timescale, the idle flying period between consecutive tasks is utilized for UAV recharging through attachment to GVs along the route. Specifically, we first develop a model that captures the mutual influence between UAVs and GVs on perception performance under resource constraints. Then, a mixed-timescale solution is proposed: at the small timescale, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MA-DRL) algorithm with gradient-free projection and auxiliary supervision is designed to schedule SC<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> resources; at the large timescale, a Hungarian-based algorithm is employed to control UAV recharging. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms benchmark schemes by reducing task execution delay and energy consumption, and enhancing CP service availability, while satisfying sensing precision, GV safety, and passenger comfort requirements."

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) path planning is essential for applications such as infrastructure inspection, environmental monitoring, and logistics distribution. A typical mission requires the UAV to depart from a base, visit designated targets, and return, forming a closed route. However, large-scale targets, high-dimensional environments, and strict timing constraints make it challenging to achieve both accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these issues, we propose SGAT-LKH (Sparse Graph Attention Network for LKH), a hybrid path planning framework that integrates a sparse graph attention encoder with the LKH solver. By using a sparse graph encoder with multi-head attention to extract informative neighborhood features, SGAT-LKH generates a data-driven candidate edge set, which alleviates reliance on manual heuristics. Extensive UAV path planning simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of SGAT-LKH: on 2D random TSP500 tasks, it achieves an average runtime of 12.8 s, about 70% faster than the LKH solver. On TSPLIB benchmarks, the average gap stays below 0.8%, and the optimality gap is only 0.085% on extended 3D tasks. These results demonstrate SGAT-LKH’s ability to balance accuracy and efficiency, providing a scalable and practical solution for large-scale and time-critical UAV missions."

This paper develops an innovative cost-effective and energy-efficient analog WAIS multibeam antenna that achieves independent beam scanning across a wide angular range. To accomplish this, a wide-beamwidth edge-cut rectangular dielectric resonator antenna (EC-RDRA) is developed with a 3-dB beamwidth exceeding 150°. Then, a reconfigurable generalized joined coupler (GJC) matrix is realized by employing a compact and low-loss 2-bit switched-line phase shifter. Subsequently, a refined theoretical model of the GJC matrix, together with a well-tailored scanning multibeam optimization algorithm, is introduced to enable accurate WAIS multibeam synthesis. The final developed WAIS multibeam antenna was experimentally validated using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) for real-time control. Measurements confirm its capability for independently scanning the multibeams with a wide 3-dB coverage of 156° and a stable peak gain variation of around 1.1 dB. This work represents the first analog multibeam antenna to achieve wide-angle coverage, independent multibeam scanning, and stable gain simultaneously."

    "abstract": "Vehicular accidents pose a substantial risk to drivers, underscoring the persistent and vital need for heightening safety measures. Early accident anticipation mechanisms are imperative for proactive measures, while detection accuracy is pivotal for prompt response and effective post-accident mitigation. Accurate and early anticipation of accidents for automated driving assistance systems in vehicles or CCTV in cities remains a complex task due to the intricate spatial-temporal interactions within traffic videos. This study presents text-informed magnitude enhancement in contrastive multiple-instance feature learning for vehicle accident detection and anticipation (TIME-VAD). Text is a better representative of concepts when compared to images in video, thus multi-modal learning is suitable. Also, the traditional assumption about feature magnitude of accidents and normal frames in magnitude based multiple-instance learning using weak supervision may not hold. This has led to the development of a novel weak-supervised learning strategy involving magnitude enhancement from textual concepts. For a better frame-level perception of accident risks in videos, dynamic temporal attentions are refined using the proposed dilated temporal conv-attention (DTCA) block. In-depth component-level analysis is performed to showcase the model’s efficacy while elucidating its operational mechanisms. Evaluation is conducted on three benchmark datasets, considering both earliness and accuracy-related metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TIME-VAD model outperforms the existing models. Compared to the previous top-performing supervised model achieving 84.7% accuracy, TIME-VAD achieves a 94.44% accuracy (measured by ROC-AUC) on the largest DoTA dataset. Notably, our model also excels in measuring how early it detects accidents compared to previous methods.

    "abstract": "Within In-Vehicle Time-Sensitive Networking (IVTSN), periodic Time-Triggered (TT) and sporadic Event-Triggered (ET) data streams coexist in a shared communication infrastructure. TT streams require deterministic transmission, whereas ET streams frequently carry critical data that demands low-latency delivery. Conventional Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) mechanisms, while effective in maintaining determinism for TT traffic, are inadequate for handling the bursty and time-sensitive characteristics of ET streams, resulting in degraded real-time performance and compromised safety and reliability in IVTSN systems. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a novel hybrid scheduling strategy based on the Time-Slot Offset Difference (TOD) between adjacent transmission links. The proposed approach integrates a global TOD-based hybrid scheduling algorithm for static time-slot allocation with a local dynamic adaptation mechanism that adjusts ET transmission at runtime. This combination ensures deterministic delivery of TT streams while significantly reducing the end-to-end delay of ET streams. Simulation results on the OMNeT++ platform demonstrate that the proposed strategy outperforms the baseline TAS and eTAS methods, effectively addressing the coexistence challenges of TT and ET streams and enhancing the overall transmission performance of IVTSN systems."

Despite these advancements, many existing designs of soft hands still lack effective in-hand vision and the ability for each finger to achieve active multi-degree-of-freedom motion. This paper proposes a cable-driven soft robotic hand that can achieve dexterous grasping and manipulation, vision-guided grasping, vision-based slip detection and compensation, as well as visually servoed in-hand manipulation. The hand has five soft fingers, each capable of independent flexion/extension motion and bidirectional ad/abduction motion. A red-green-blue-depth (RGB-D) camera is integrated into the palm of the soft hand to enable in-hand vision capability. Modeling of the soft hand is established to analyze its kinematics, statics, and manipulability. A series of experiments are conducted to demonstrate its dexterous grasping and manipulation capabilities on a variety of objects. Using 3D point cloud data from the in-palm camera, an effective vision-guided grasping strategy is developed to grasp objects on a table. The in-hand vision also enables slip detection and compensation during grasping to maintain the grasp stability. Furthermore, a hierarchical, visually servoed controller is developed to perform closed-loop in-hand object manipulation. With its high dexterity and visual feedback capabilities, the soft hand will find important applications such as household object manipulation and food picking/sorting, and may also be used as a prosthetic hand or an auxiliary hand for humans."

    "abstract": "Data-driven autonomous driving (AD) systems typically use incremental optimization based on various scenarios to improve driving safety and overall performance. However, existing algorithms lack the capability to integrate information across scenarios and optimize synchronously. Incremental optimization for different scenarios often results in catastrophic forgetting during continual learning, reducing the system’s generalizability and reliability in complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose a scenario-driven federated reinforcement learning (FRL) AD system with broad applicability. Our proposed cross-scenario optimization uses a federated architecture to replace the data-driven incremental learning process, allowing specific experiences to be shared across different expert data distributions. This approach develops highly generalizable imitation learning (IL) experts and effectively addresses the problem of catastrophic forgetting in continual learning. Furthermore, our proposed dynamic driving suggestions provide multifaceted guidance to reinforcement learning (RL) students, such as feature extraction, reward function modeling, loss function construction, and population-based optimization. This guidance specifically targets the challenges of high-dimensional state space representation and objective alignment in RL. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal fusion algorithms. Notably, our system achieves highly reliable control performance in complex traffic environments with only a single monocular camera."

    "abstract": "Despite significant advancements in terrestrial networks, inherent limitations persist in providing reliable coverage to remote areas and maintaining resilience during natural disasters. Multi-tier networks with low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and high-altitude platforms (HAPs) offer promising solutions, but face challenges from high mobility and dynamic channel conditions that cause unstable connections and frequent handovers. In this paper, we design a three-tier network architecture that integrates LEO satellites, HAPs, and ground terminals with hybrid free-space optical (FSO) and radio frequency (RF) links to maximize coverage while maintaining connectivity reliability. This hybrid approach leverages the high bandwidth of FSO for satellite-to-HAP links and the weather resilience of RF for HAP-to-ground links. We formulate a joint optimization problem to simultaneously balance downlink transmission rate and handover frequency by optimizing network configuration and satellite handover decisions. The problem is highly dynamic and non-convex with time-coupled constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-guided truncated quantile critics algorithm with dynamic action masking (LTQC-DAM) that utilizes dynamic action masking to eliminate unnecessary exploration and employs LLMs to adaptively tune hyperparameters. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LTQC-DAM algorithm outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of convergence, downlink transmission rate, and handover frequency. We also reveal that compared to other state-of-the-art LLMs, DeepSeek delivers the best performance through gradual, contextually-aware parameter adjustments."

A gallium nitride (GaN) monolithic microwave-integrated circuit (MMIC) PA operating from 11.5–16 GHz is combined with a gallium arsenide (GaAs) gate-modulator MMIC capable of detecting signal envelopes up to 1 GHz in bandwidth. Envelope simulations using the measured PA and envelope detector data demonstrate an adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) improvement of 9 dB for a 100 MHz, 300-tone signal. The two MMICs are hybridly integrated on a PCB that provides baseband amplification, dc biasing, and supports dual RF drive for adjustable timing and amplitude offsets between the PA and envelope detector paths. Measured third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>) suppression of 4.25-17.7 dB is achieved for 2-tone excitations with up to 1 GHz of instantaneous bandwidth, with 35 dBm of output power, a 2 percentage point drop in power-added efficiency (PAE), and a 2.25 dB reduction in gain. Linearization effectiveness is limited by the baseband path dispersion for broadband noise-like signals. Nonetheless, the results demonstrate the potential of analog gate modulation for efficient, wideband PA linearization without digital overhead."

Designed to address the challenges of acoustic communication such as long propagation delays and limited bandwidth, the proposed protocol adopts a contention-free, delay-aware time scheduling mechanism. It introduces a hierarchical frame structure with area-based slot partitioning and propagation delay-aware slot assignment to ensure collision-free and low-latency communication. A deterministic scheduling algorithm assigns transmission offsets based on sorted propagation delays, promoting fairness and scalability across multiple AUV swarms. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to AB-MAC, AST-TDMA, TDMA, and slotted-ALOHA, the proposed MAC protocol reduces end-to-end delay by over 80%, increases uplink channel utilization up to 5× (exceeding 50%), and maintains a retransmission overhead ratio as low as 1.5 under heavy traffic conditions. Moreover, it achieves a propagation-aware delay factor close to 1.0, indicating near-optimal delay behavior. These results confirm the protocol’s effectiveness for reliable and efficient communication in dense USANs."

    "abstract": "Low-frequency model construction plays a crucial role in seismic inversion by providing the essential initial model. Traditional two-point geostatistical modeling, which relies on variograms, is often insufficient for capturing complex geological structures. While multipoint geostatistics can better address lateral discontinuities, these methods typically depend on training images, which are from geological interpretation and seldom available in practice. The pattern-feature correlation method circumvents this limitation by employing seismic profiles as an effective substitute for training images. However, this approach tends to produce smoothed results in areas distant from well control. To overcome this drawback, we have developed a novel horizon-constrained multipoint pattern-feature correlation interpolation technique. This method utilizes interpreted horizons as structural constraints to partition the modeling domain into geologically consistent subregions. Within each subregion, multipoint pattern-feature correlation interpolation is applied, significantly improving the accuracy and lateral continuity of the reconstructed models. Synthetic and field data tests demonstrate that the incorporation of horizon constraints yields initial models that are not only more accurate but also better aligned with the actual subsurface geology. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our method by applying the reconstructed models to Bayesian linearized inversion. The results confirm the high accuracy of both the interpolation and subsequent inversion, highlighting the superior performance of the proposed technique."

    "abstract": "Recent developments in cyber-physical systems have increased the importance of maximizing the freshness of the information about the physical environment. However, optimizing the access policies of Internet of Things devices to maximize the data freshness, measured as a function of the Age-of-Information (AoI) metric, is a challenging task. This work introduces two algorithms to optimize the information update process in cyber-physical systems operating under the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">generate-at-will model</i>, by finding an online policy without knowing the characteristics of the transmission delay or the age cost function. The optimization seeks to minimize the time-average cost, which integrates the AoI at the receiver and the data transmission cost, making the approach suitable for a broad range of scenarios. Both algorithms employ policy gradient methods within the framework of model-free reinforcement learning (RL) and are specifically designed to handle continuous state and action spaces. Each algorithm minimizes the cost using a distinct strategy for deciding when to send an information update. Moreover, we demonstrate that it is feasible to apply the two strategies simultaneously, leading to an additional reduction in cost. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms exhibit good convergence properties and achieve a time-average cost within 3% of the optimal value, when the latter is computable. A comparison with other state-of-the-art methods shows that the proposed algorithms outperform them in one or more of the following aspects: being applicable to a broader range of scenarios, achieving a lower time-average cost, and requiring a computational cost at least one order of magnitude lower."

Therefore, this paper proposes a new load duration curve (LDC)-based method aimed at maximizing to smooth peak load to calculate the CC of ESS with heterogeneous power-to-energy ratios. This method shares similarities with cooperative game theory, which obscures the actual capacity contribution of storage, so the shapley value is used to calculate the marginal CC of each ESS in the aggregation. Simulation results show that the aggregated CC calculated by this method outperforms traditional LDC methods, providing a valuable reference for reliable CC calculations as heterogeneous ESS integrate into the grid."

    "abstract": "Microbubble (MB)-mediated focused ultrasound (FUS) therapy targeting the spinal cord requires reliable, intra-operative treatment monitoring of cavitation activity within the spinal canal. Prefocal cavitation during transvertebral focused ultrasound can hinder assessment of intracanal cavitation events. Due to reflection and subsequent refocusing of sound by the vertebral bones, circulating MBs in the prelaminar space can generate strong acoustic signals that interfere with attenuated emissions from MBs in the canal, pushing the latter below the noise floor of prefocal cavitation activity in reconstructed images. We performed in vivo ‘flash-replenishment’ ultrasound in porcine dorsal musculature and determined reperfusion rates are on the order of 2-3 seconds in the largest vessels supplying the muscles after MB destruction. Then, using ‘Flash-Replenishment’ style pulse sequencing common in contrast ultrasound, paired with transvertebral FUS sequencing, we suppressed cavitation at its source in the prelaminar, pre-vertebral regions, and performed transvertebral passive acoustic mapping through <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ex vivo</i> human vertebrae. We show <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ex vivo</i> that, on average, interleaving ‘flash’ pulses during FUS sequencing can raise the canal-prefocal source strength ratio in reconstructed images by approximately 1.75 times compared to conventional pulse sequencing. We further show that the maximum pressure in the canal during ‘flash’ pulses is much lower than the subsequent ‘therapeutic’ pulses, suggesting the ‘flash’ pulse will have limited potential to induce bioeffects in the spinal cord. In summary, this work exemplifies that a spatial and temporal window of bubble-free prefocal space can provide an unobscured sightline for monitoring intracanal cavitation reliably."

This article proposes an effective switching loss prediction method for SiC MOSFET power modules based on multi-layer backpropagation artificial neural network (ANN). The proposed method accurately models the regression relationship between the static parameters and switching loss of SiC MOSFETs, allowing for the direct prediction of switching loss using static parameters obtained from tests or datasheets. By leveraging static parameters that inherently encode structural and parasitic effects, the model adapts to both intra-batch and inter-batch manufacturing fluctuations without explicit physical parameter tuning.

Compared to DC electromagnets, pulsed electromagnets generate powerful magnetic fields instantaneously and produce Joule heat only for a short time, making them more energy efficient. If the design of pulse electromagnets and power supplies becomes easier, they are expected to have a wide range of applications in sustainable accelerators. The design of pulsed electromagnets requires three-dimensional transient magnetic field analysis that takes into account eddy currents and skin effects, but high precision design can be achieved by using analysis software such as OPERA-3D. On the other hand, in the design of pulsed power supplies, it is necessary to treat the load impedance as a time varying model, but in many cases, actual measurement data is insufficient. Conventionally, electromagnets and power supplies have been analyzed separately, so there was a risk of problems being discovered during post-completion evaluation tests. To address this issue, we propose model-based development (MBD) that enables integrated analysis of both components. In this study, we evaluated the following two integrated analysis approaches: (1) an MBD method that links OPERA-3D's transient analysis model with its circuit editor function, and (2) an MBD method that combines OPERA-3D's analysis results with circuit simulation in MATLAB/Simulink. The introduction of MBD is expected to reduce power-on test time and the number of prototypes, leading to reduced development costs and shorter development times. This presentation will report on preliminary results of an evaluation of MBD implementation."

Offline, we perform a pre-run reachability check to verify that the motion plan respects speed and acceleration magnitude limits. Online, we apply a quadratic program to track the motion plan under the same limits. We use a one-step reachability test to bound the maximum disturbance the system is capable of rejecting. When the state coincides with the reference path we recover perfect tracking in the deterministic case, and we correct errors using a KKT-inspired weight. We demonstrate that safety stops and unplanned deviations are handled efficiently, and the system returns to the motion plan without replanning. We demonstrate our system’s improved performance over pure pursuit in simulation."

With the rapid proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) services, efficiently coordinating inference tasks and reducing communication burden within these multi-tier network architectures becomes a critical deployment challenge. Current LLM serving paradigms exhibit significant limitations: on-device deployment restricts service to lightweight LLMs due to hardware constraints, while cloud-centric deployment encounters resource congestion and considerable prompt communication overhead during peak periods. Model-cascading inference, though better suited for multi-tier networks, depends on static, manually-tuned thresholds that cannot adapt to dynamic network conditions or varying task complexities. To address these challenges, we propose RecServe, a recursive offloading framework tailored for LLM serving in multi-tier networks. RecServe introduces a task-specific hierarchical confidence evaluation mechanism that guides offloading decisions based on inferred task complexity in progressively scaled LLMs across device, edge, and cloud tiers. To further enable intelligent task routing across tiers, RecServe employs a sliding-window-based dynamic offloading strategy with quantile interpolation, enabling real-time tracking of historical confidence distributions and adaptive offloading threshold adjustments. This design allows inference tasks to be recursively offloaded to higher tiers only when necessary, optimizing heterogeneous resource utilization while reducing cross-tier communication with little compromise on service quality. Theoretical analysis provides distinct conditions under which RecServe is expected to achieve reduced communication burden and computational costs. Experiments on eight datasets demonstrate that RecServe outperforms CasServe in both service quality and communication efficiency, and reduces the communication burden by over 50% compared to centralized cloud-based serving."

    "abstract": "Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is often degraded by multiplicative speckle and limited resolution, hindering reliable interpretation. To address this, we proposed MambaR-ESRGAN, a unified restoration framework that jointly performs super-resolution and speckle noise denoising by embedding Mamba's state-space modeling into a Real-ESRGAN backbone. Central to the design are Residual-in-Residual Mamba (RRDM) blocks, which efficiently capture long-range context while preserving fine local structure, enabling accurate suppression of speckle without losing details on edges. MambaR-ESRGAN is computationally efficient and delivers consistent quality gains over strong baselines. On representative benchmarks, it improves PSNR by 9.4% (from 24.16 dB to 26.43 dB) and SSIM by 16.4% (from 0.7065 to 0.8226) compared with the original Real-ESRGAN, with qualitative results showing sharper edges and better preservation of linear features. Extensive experiments across diverse SAR datasets confirm robustness and generalizability, indicating the method's suitability for downstream applications such as flood delineation, road mapping, and ship detection."

    "abstract": "Large-scale, high-precision seabed topography data serves as the foundation for scientific research on Earth's shape and geological structure. Satellite altimetry data combined with classical gravity field inversion methods are important means for obtaining large-scale seabed topography. However, the inversion quality in coastal zones remains poor due to factors such as observational data quality of satellite altimetry and linear assumptions in the inversion process. To address this, this study takes the Gulf of Mexico as an example and investigates a method for constructing high-resolution seabed topography models by integrating airborne gravity data and high-resolution satellite altimetry data. To overcome the linear assumption limitation in traditional gravity-geologic methods regarding the relationship between gravity signals and topographic signals, a water-depth-constrained convolutional neural network (CNN) was introduced, resulting in a 1'×1' resolution seabed topography model for the Gulf of Mexico. The findings demonstrate that the seabed topography model constructed using combined airborne gravity and satellite altimetry gravity data outperforms models based solely on satellite altimetry gravity data, both in shallow and deep-sea regions. In nearshore areas lacking bathymetric constraints, the integration of airborne gravity data improves inversion accuracy by approximately 17.72%. Furthermore, by incorporating the U.S. coastal bathymetric data released by the National Ocean Service (NOS), the inversion accuracy in nearshore shallow-water regions was further enhanced by about 60.76%. Based on this dataset, the study also examined the dependence of gravity-based seabed topography inversion accuracy on water depth data."

    "abstract": "Speaker, author, and other biometric identification applications often compare a sample's similarity to a database of templates to determine the identity. Given that data may be noisy and similarity measures can be inaccurate, such a comparison may not reliably identify the true identity as the most similar. Still, even the similarity rank based on an inaccurate similarity measure can disclose private information about the true identity. We propose a methodology for quantifying the privacy disclosure of such a similarity rank by estimating its probability distribution. It is based on either determining the histogram of the similarity rank for the true speaker or, when data are scarce, modeling the histogram with the beta-binomial distribution. We express the disclosure in terms of entropy (bits), such that the disclosure from independent features is additive. Our experiments demonstrate that all tested speaker and author characterizations contain personally identifying information (PII) that can aid in identification, with embeddings from speaker recognition algorithms containing the most information, followed by phone embeddings, linguistic embeddings, and fundamental frequency. Our initial experiments show that the disclosure of PII increases with the length of test samples, but it is bounded by the length of database templates. The provided metric, similarity rank disclosure, provides a way to compare the disclosure of PII between biometric features and merge them to aid identification. It can thus aid in the holistic evaluation of threats to privacy in speech and other biometric technologies."

    "abstract": "The ability to autonomously learn patterns from datasets has made artificial intelligence (AI) models increasingly attractive for use in optimizing timeslot allocation in Link-K time-division multiple access (TDMA) networks. Despite their potential, they require large-scale training datasets, and acquiring such data from tactical data link TDMA systems is challenging because of security constraints. This study focuses on the optimization of timeslot resource allocation in the Korean Joint Tactical Data Link System (JTDLS), which operates on a Link-K time-division multiple access network. Currently, network operators allocate timeslot resources mainly based on empirical experience. However, this study employs AI models trained on simulation data to enable predictive resource allocation. A simulation environment, the Link-K simulation data generator (LK-SDG), was developed to generate simulation data representing timeslot allocation outcomes across various operational scenarios. The generated dataset was validated for consistency using the Link-K timeslot allocation formula (LK-TAF) to ensure its reliability while requiring continuous enhancement through feature vector incorporation and weight adjustment for complementary improvement. Feature vectors comprising operational scenario parameters, node characteristics, and message transmission patterns, were utilized to train AI models capable of predicting the per-node timeslot allocation. The proposed approach provides proactive support for JTDLS network administration by enabling faster and more adaptive timeslot allocation compared with experience-based allocation, thereby minimizing overallocation and reducing transmission delays for mission-critical tactical messages."

This study integrates EV charging stations (CSs) with photovoltaic (PV) systems and reactive power compensators, hypothesizing that this combination enhances both technical performance and economic operation. A novel framework was developed using detailed road, grid, and PV modules’ data, incorporating realistic load profiles, grid hosting factor restrictions, and rooftop area calculations. The analysis revealed a 12% reduction in daily energy losses and a 6% improvement in the Voltage Deviation Index (VDI), alongside optimized energy generation and demand alignment. Additionally, the proposed PV installations efficiently utilized available rooftop areas, and reducing grid dependency by up to 40% during peak sunlight hours. From an economic perspective, a comprehensive cash flow analysis was conducted to evaluate the financial viability of the proposed integration over a 25-year life-time period. This study quantifies long-term cost savings, revenue streams, and payback period, providing a robust financial outlook for decision-makers. These results underscore the potential of integrating CSs, PV systems, and reactive power compensators to enhance grid stability, lower operational costs, and support renewable energy adoption. This study contributes to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) seven (Affordable and Clean Energy) and elven (Sustainable Cities and Communities) by providing a comprehensive framework for the sustainable planning and operation of EV charging infrastructures."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) into Wireless Sensor Network (WSNs) architectures has emerged as a promising solution for enhancing data collection efficiency. UAV-assisted data collection for WSNs should resolve the problem of energy-efficient communication between UAV and arbitrarily dispersed ground sensors. To enhance the reliability and efficiency of the entire system, an Optimal Topology Control and Energy-efficient Scheduling strategy (OTCES) for UAV-assisted data collection in WSNs is put forward. Based on the clustered-WSNs, a multi-objective model for data collection that minimizes the energy consumption of UAV and sensor nodes is established. Firstly, a density based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm is employed to group sensor nodes within the UAV’s effective communication range. Subsequently, to reduce the energy consumption of sensors and data transmission during UAV hovering, an improved deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is proposed to address the issue of optimal UAV hovering positions and sensor’s transmission power. Then, to minimize the flight energy consumption of UAV, an ant colony optimization-inspired algorithm is designed to figure out the best traverse path. The results of simulation experiments show that compared with traditional methods, the proposed strategy has achieved remarkable results in terms of system energy consumption."

    "abstract": "Multi-label medical text classification faces severe class imbalance, where rare pathological conditions appear hundreds of times less frequently than common findings. This imbalance causes standard neural networks to achieve high overall accuracy while failing to detect rare but clinically important conditions. Existing sampling strategies rely on heuristic rules rather than theoretical foundations and treat all minority classes uniformly despite their varying degrees of rarity. We propose two adaptive sampling strategies: a rule-based method using percentile-based categorization and a formula-based method grounded in Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension theory. The formula-based approach derives upsampling weights through <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">w<sub>c</sub></i> = ln(<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r<sub>c</sub></i> + 1) · α<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>c</i></sub>, combining logarithmic scaling of imbalance ratios with smooth interpolation. This formulation aligns upsampling decisions with sample complexity requirements from statistical learning theory while preventing overfitting. Experiments on the PadChest chest X-ray report dataset demonstrate that the formula-based method achieves 31.9% improvement in Macro F1 with 34.5% fewer training samples than rule-based sampling. The method reduces the F1 gap from 0.51 to 0.42, demonstrating significantly improved balance between rare and common class performance. Results validate that theoretically-motivated sampling strategies yield measurable benefits over heuristic approaches."

In this study, we propose a novel framework using deep learning techniques to address the problem of stochastic detection in contactless collision avoidance, utilizing end-of-arm radar safety sensors for collaborative robots. Based on the joint positions and velocities as well as end-effector positions and velocities of the collaborative robots, our method predicts the range of stochastic detection with a mean square error of 0.0093, before comparing it with real-time sensor data to accurately identify pre-contact events as abnormal losses. The experimental results demonstrate that our method guarantees 100% safety while reducing false alarms caused by stochastic detection to fewer than one occurrence per minute of operation. This study presents a real-time framework with a computational time of 1.03 milliseconds, 20 milliseconds of safe reaction time, and a procedure for resolving the stochastic detection issue in end-of-arm radar safety sensors mounted on the flange of any collaborative robot."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its expanding applications in health monitoring, body-worn cameras, and smart glasses, the demand for high data rate video transmission and compact device size has become critical. This shift has necessitated the development of low-power communication systems and battery-efficient or battery-less designs. Traditional high-data-rate communication methods consume mWs of power, such as Wi-Fi and backscatter communication (for high data rates, higher transmitter power is required to handle the two-fold path loss between the transmitter and sensor node), and require converting analog information into digital bits before transmission. These approaches rely on Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs), which generate substantial data volumes, resulting in increased storage and processing demands while consuming significant power PADC2N (exponential), where N is the number of bits. Consequently, communication power increases PcommN (linearly), resulting in overall higher power consumption. To address these challenges and reduce the communication energy of a video sensor node while enabling a more compact form factor, we propose an Analog Voltage-to-Time Converter for Video Sensor Node (ATC-Tx) that exploits a novel time-domain mode of Body Communication. This system directly converts analog video information into pulse-width modulated signals for transmission, leveraging the wideband characteristics of the Human Body Communication (HBC) channel as the transmission medium. This approach enables low-power sensing and communication by eliminating the need for ADCs and digitization at energy-constrained VSNs. The ATC-Tx achieves an energy efficiency of 21.9 pJ/Sa, leveraging Time-Domain Body Communication (TD-BC), which results in a two-order-of-magnitude improvement over existing Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components. This improvement is accompanied by a 3× reduction in power consumption compared to the previous voltage mode Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Communication (EQS-HBC)-based implementation, as well as significant reductions in implementation area."

To solve the performance monotonicity issue, a novel transmission protocol employing random training signals (TSs) and an associated stochastic channel estimation method are then proposed for orthogonal EMP (OEMP)-modelled systems with significantly reduced statistics requirement. Practically measurable modelling errors are defined through alternative mean-squared-error (MSE) analyses, establishing their relationships with EMP and OEMP residual signal powers respectively under reduced nonlinearity orders. The OEMP modelling error is further proved to approach the OEMP residual signal power, ensuring the desired performance monotonicity. Numerical results validate the theoretical findings and highlight the impact of TS design on nonlinear channel estimation in practical applications."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel series voltage injection-based dual-port triple active bridge converter aimed at reducing the AC link current stress of the converter. This reduction in link current stress is achieved by incorporating an auxiliary series voltage injection from a third bridge. The proposed converter has enhanced power transfer capability with input and output voltage variation compared to conventional dual active bridge converters. Secondly, it exhibits lower link current stress, leading to reduced switch stress and improved efficiency due to lower losses. Despite the increase in component count, the overall cost of the converter is reduced. Thirdly, the design of the proposed converter allows for reduced link inductance for a given peak current in magnetic components. This is an improvement over conventional designs, even when advanced modulation/optimization is applied for applications with wide ranges of operating points. A detailed cost-efficiency comparison shows that the proposed solution is not only efficient, but also economical compared to the conventional solution, irrespective of the increased components. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis that includes soft-switching behavior, mathematical modeling across various operating modes, and loss calculation of the proposed configuration. Detailed performance comparison with existing configurations employing various modulation and optimization schemes shows the superiority of the proposed solution. Finally, the proposed concept is verified through simulation studies and through a scaled-down experimental prototype."

    "abstract": "Traditional quantitative genetics rely on known pedigrees for estimating polygenic breeding values and variance components. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing, estimation of empirical relationships between individuals have become feasible. The single-step genomic BLUP procedure integrates polygenic and genomic information but requires intricate pedigree connections, leading to computationally demanding matrix operations. Here, we propose DYpREG, a flexible proximal operator multi-objective regularization method. DYpREG is a splitting algorithm that accommodates two distinct loss functions and a regularization function that can be chosen as LASSO, ridge regression (RR) or elastic net (EN). Notably, it incorporates pre-calculated breeding values without the need for extensive relationship matrix computations. Evaluated on two traits with different heritabilities from mice and pig, DYpREG with RR regularizer showed the best predictive performance compared to DYpREG with LASSO and EN regularizers as well as to all methods lacking polygenic information. The mean squared error (MSE) reduction was notable for both mice traits (1.5% and 24.77%) and both pig traits (2.8% and 2.1%). Comparative analyses with Bayesian reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and spike-and-slab (BayesC) regression also revealed consistent improvements. Hence, DYpREG effectively integrates polygenic information, enhancing prediction accuracy in genomic evaluations."

    "abstract": "The electromigration (EM) can introduce voids and hillocks in through-silicon vias (TSVs) and redistributed layer (RDL) interconnects, increasing the risks of short-circuit and open-circuit failures and thereby severely affecting the reliability of chiplet systems. In this article, the EM failure mechanism of the interconnects under electrical–thermal–stress multiphysics coupling is investigated, and a novel method for EM lifetime prediction based on coupled multiphysics modeling and finite element simulation is proposed. The implementation of dynamic failure simulation through element activation/deactivation technology employs a 20% void area ratio as the interconnect failure criterion, allowing for quantitative lifetime prediction. The consistency between the experimental and simulation results demonstrated the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed lifetime prediction method. The overall prediction error is reduced by 11% with the state-of-the-art EM prediction method. Furthermore, based on this method, the effect of different interposer materials and TSV radii on interconnect EM is investigated. The evidence exhibits that using diamond as an interposer material can significantly mitigate interconnect EM phenomenon and enhance the reliability of the whole structure compared with silicon and glass. Furthermore, increasing the radius of TSV enhances EM resistance in interconnects, with each <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1~\\mu $</tex-math> </inline-formula>m increase in radius extending the average interconnect lifetime by 12.75 h.

However, single MRR-based RC remains limited in nonlinear response and memory capacity for time-series prediction. We propose a dual-MRR cascaded RC architecture to enhance these nonlinear dynamics and memory effects. In the Santa Fe prediction task, this dual-ring structure achieves a minimum normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 0.0382, a 38% reduction compared to a single-ring system without feedback (0.0614). Furthermore, to enhance task-specific memory, an external ’delayed input’ technique is applied. By optimizing the input parameters, the NMSE is further reduced to 0.0147, corresponding to a total 76% reduction compared to the single-ring baseline without feedback. This work demonstrates a robust path to high-performance photonic reservoir computing."

As health systems worldwide undergo digital transformation, FHIR offers a flexible framework for integrating electronic health records, analytics platforms, and decision-support tools. Its growth has been accelerated by policy mandates such as the 21st Century Cures Act, as well as the availability of application programming interfaces (APIs), software development kits (SDKs), and web standards. Globally, FHIR has been adopted or piloted by national health systems in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, and incorporated into World Health Organization data initiatives, underscoring its role in global digital health strategy. Documented outcomes of this review include comprehensive mapping of FHIR applications across clinical, research, and public health domains; identification of adoption barriers and enablers; insights into integration with generative AI and large language models for predictive modeling, automated documentation, and decision support; and guidance for future innovations such as blockchain-enabled infrastructure and cloud-native scalability.

In the context of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC), this work provides a system-theoretic framework for intent sharing through the lens of output regulation. We present analytical results showing two fundamental aspects of CACC with intent sharing: a) when vehicle-to-vehicle communication is reliable, intent sharing provides no benefits over status sharing, as both sharing paradigms result in the same protocol; b) intent sharing becomes beneficial when vehicle-to-vehicle communication is unreliable, in which case the latest communicated intent can be used to reconstruct the missing information of the neighboring vehicle in the near future. Together with theoretical analysis, numerical validations with synthetic and real-world data are provided, where the benefits of CACC with the proposed implementation of intent sharing are shown against several state-of-the-art CACC protocols."

    "abstract": "The generation of high-voltage rectangular pulses of predictable shape and minimal distortion is a valuable tool in calibration and testing environments. This may be achieved by using a line pulser: a single charged transmission line and a high-speed switch to generate a pulse with a fast front. The overall shape of the produced pulse depends on the impedance of the load and is only rectangular if the load is matched to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line. Another transmission line circuit for generating a pulse in the tens of nanoseconds range is known as the self-matching line pulser, which produces a pulse of a certain duration regardless of the load. While the circuit, in principle, is simple, the practical implementation has shown anomalous pulse distortion under a variety of circumstances. The origin of the contributions to the nonideal wave shape and late-time oscillations of the output pulse has been investigated with combined circuit simulations and experimental demonstrations. The self-matched line pulser (SMLP) may be configured to charge either of the conductors in the transmission line used as the energy storage element. In addition to the stray reactance at the connections, distortion due to electromagnetic coupling is evaluated for the two charging schemes. The primary contributor to distortion is stray reactance when the outer conductor is charged and electromagnetic coupling when the inner conductor is charged. Design strategies using these results are discussed."

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) mitigates the annotation burden in object detection by leveraging unlabeled data, providing a scalable solution for modern perception systems. Concurrently, detection transformers (DETRs) have emerged as a popular end-to-end framework, offering advantages such as non-maximum suppression (NMS)-free inference. However, existing SSODmethods are predominantly designed for conventional detectors, leaving the exploration of DETR-based SSOD largely uncharted. This paper presents a systematic study to bridge this gap. We begin by identifying two principal obstacles in semi-supervised DETR training: (1) the inherent one-to-one assignment mechanism of DETRs is highly sensitive to noisy pseudo-labels, which impedes training efficiency; and (2) the query-based decoder architecture complicates the design of an effective consistency regularization scheme, limiting further performance gains. To address these challenges, we propose Semi-DETR++, a novel framework for efficient SSOD with DETRs. Our approach introduces a stage-wise hybrid matching strategy that enhances robustness to noisy pseudo-labels by synergistically combining one-to-many and one-to-one assignments while preserving NMS-free inference. Furthermore, based on our observation of the unique layer-wise decoding behavior in DETRs, we develop a simple yet effective re-decode query consistency training method to regularize the decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Semi-DETR++ enables more efficient semi-supervised learning across various DETR architectures, outperforming existing methods by significant margins. The proposed components are also flexible and versatile, showing superior generalization by readily extending to semi-supervised segmentation tasks.

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of mobile and edge computing, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key technology to enable collaborative model training on mobile devices while preserving user privacy. Secure aggregation is an essential component in FL to protect local gradients and compute the global model, but it is vulnerable to threats from high-latency. When some clients arrive late, the pairwise masks among clients cannot be canceled properly, forcing the server to learn the late clients' masks in order to complete the aggregation. As a result, network uncertainty puts the aggregation process at risk of either service interruption or privacy leakage. While double masking is treated as the most effective solution to achieve both robustness and privacy, its computational and communication costs are prohibitive, especially for resource-constrained mobile devices. To address these challenges, we propose an Efficient Mobile-Cloud Collaborative Aggregation for Federated Learning with Latency Resilience (EFL-LR). We leverage Shamir's secret sharing and a key-homomorphic pseudorandom function to ensure privacy for high-latency clients while reducing computation overheads to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {O}(n\\log ^{2} n + d)$</tex-math></inline-formula> for clients and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {O}(n+d)$</tex-math></inline-formula> for the server.

This article proposes an informative trajectory planning approach, namely, reusable belief tree search with sigma point-based mutual information reward approximation (ReSPIRe), for SAT in unknown cluttered environments under considerably inaccurate prior target information and a limited sensing field of view (FOV). We first develop a novel sigma point (SP)-based approximation approach to fast and accurately estimate mutual information (MI) reward under non-Gaussian belief distributions, utilizing informative sampling in state and observation spaces to mitigate the computational intractability of integral calculation. To tackle the significant uncertainty associated with inadequate prior target information, we propose the hierarchical particle structure in ReSPIRe, which not only extracts critical particles for global route guidance, but also adjusts the particle number adaptively for planning efficiency. Building upon the hierarchical structure, we develop the reusable belief tree search (RBTS) approach to build a policy tree for online trajectory planning under uncertainty, which reuses rollout evaluation to improve planning efficiency. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that ReSPIRe outperforms representative benchmark methods with smaller MI approximation error, higher search efficiency, and more stable tracking performance, while maintaining outstanding computational efficiency."

The inherent design principle of the existing 5G mobile network, i.e., radio access network-mobile core network separation, poses two issue 1) inflexible computation load distribution among geographically spanned computing resources and 2) pressure to the gateway. To address the issues, we proposed a computation-aware converged service-based architecture (CAC-SBA). The key idea is to leverage the converged-service-based architecture (C-SBA) design principle, which extends the SBA from CN into the RAN, enabling direct message exchanges between RAN and CN. Based on the C-SBA principle, we re-architect the functional split between RAN and CN, define the procedures, and modify the state management mechanism for both communication and sensing. A large-scale simulation reveals that the CAC-SBA accommodates 4.0 times larger sensing requests than the existing 5G CN, in the case that the gateway is a bottleneck of the entire system, with the assumption of uniform service type and constant background load. A proof-of-concept prototype using cloud and edge infrastructures is implemented and extensively evaluated under real-world conditions. The results demonstrate that CAC-SBA significantly outperforms the conventional 5G CN in both sensing and C-plane communication efficiency. For example, the sensing and communication latencies are reduced by 63.6% and 54.5%, respectively."

    "abstract": "In the collaborative control of redundant manipulators, maximizing manipulability is a widely feasible approach for avoiding singularities. However, the manipulability is a nonlinear and nonconvex function with respect to joint angles. Most existing approaches do not directly consider the manipulability optimization or transform the manipulability optimization problem (MOP) into a convex one. Such a transformation may affect achieving the globally optimal value of the MOP. To address this limitation, a manipulability optimization based on the coevolutionary neural dynamics (MOCND) scheme is proposed to maximize the manipulability of manipulators. By integrating neural dynamics (ND) model with coevolutionary mechanism, this scheme performs a global search to optimize manipulability for multimanipulator systems during the execution of tasks. Theoretical analyses prove the global convergence and robustness of the proposed MOCND scheme. Simulations and physical experiments on real manipulators confirm its practical effectiveness."

However, existing methods for small object detection are primarily designed for visible light images and exhibit poor performance when applied to infrared images due to their distinct characteristics such as lower resolution, lack of color and texture information, and higher noise levels. Most existing infrared small object detection algorithms are based on segmentation networks, which often struggle with false alarms when processing UAV-captured imagery with complex backgrounds. Moreover, these segmentation networks are computationally intensive, making them unsuitable for deployment on IoT edge devices. To address these challenges, we propose MFF-DCNet, an efficient network specifically designed for infrared small object detection in UAVs. The proposed network comprises a novel Depth-wise Cross-stage Transformer enhanced backbone and a Multi-Feature Focus neck structure, collectively strengthening multiscale feature extraction and representation.

These platforms enable early-stage validation of dynamic models and control strategies before Electronic Control Unit (ECU) deployment, offering critical insights and improved functionality throughout the development process. This article presents a comprehensive framework for the design, implementation, and validation of an Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system using a Model-Based Design (MBD) methodology within a real-time automotive simulation environment. The control algorithm is developed based on a high-fidelity 14-degree-of-freedom (DOF) vehicle model that accurately captures lateral dynamics under diverse maneuvering, road, and tire conditions. The proposedworkflowfollows theV-model development cycle and adheres to a standardized ESC performance specification, ensuring traceability of functional and performance requirements. The controller is deployed onto a real-time operating system (RTOS) and validated through Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing procedures. Experimental correlation with real vehicle data is conducted to assess model fidelity and control performance, and additional benchmarking against the vehicle’s embedded ESC ECU, executed within the simulation environment, demonstrates the improved effectiveness of the proposed controller. The results confirm that the proposed MBDframework enables the efficient development of robust, regulation-compliant ESC systems, supporting the advancement of vehicle safety, model accuracy, and embedded control validation within the automotive domain."

This article presents an uplink sensing framework for estimating key parameters—Doppler frequency (DF), angle-of-arrival (AoA), CFO, and path delay—of multiple static and moving targets. A refined orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signal model is adopted to account for spectral misalignment caused by transmitter and receiver filtering under CFO and TO. The proposed method leverages temporal and spatial spectral analysis, noise averaging, and adaptive thresholding to extract path-specific features. Compared to existing approaches, it avoids the need for line-of-sight (LOS) conditions or prior user location knowledge and mitigates the nonlinear complexities associated with CSI-ratio-based models. The framework includes tailored algorithms for DF, CFO, path delay, and AoA estimation. Simulation results confirm the presented framework’s effectiveness in accurately sensing both static and dynamic targets in asynchronous uplink PMN scenarios."

To address this, we propose ABBR, a practical framework for Byzantine-robust and privacy-preserving FL. We are the first to utilize dimensionality reduction to speed up the private computation of complex filtering rules in privacy-preserving FL. Additionally, we analyze the accuracy loss of vector-wise filtering in low-dimensional space and introduce an adaptive tuning strategy to minimize the impact of malicious models that bypass filtering on the global model. We implement ABBR with state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust aggregation rules and evaluate it on public datasets, showing that it runs significantly faster, has minimal communication overhead, and maintains nearly the same Byzantine-resilience as the baselines."

    "abstract": "The increasing emphasis on spiritual well-being in contemporary society has fueled a growing demand for empathetic dialogue generation. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in dialogue generation tasks, their empathetic capabilities remain limited due to the absence of explicit emotional guidance. To address this limitation, we propose EmoDiag, an emotion-aware LLM adaptation framework designed to enhance the empathetic abilities of LLMs through fine-grained emotional control and a non-intrusive adaptation mechanism using the residual memory transformer (RMT). Specifically, EmoDiag employs RMT's encoder to predict the target emotional state from past conversations, which serves as an explicit control condition. Then, EmoDiag seamlessly integrates the predicted emotional state into the LLM's generation process through RMT's decoder at the logit level, enabling emotion-aware dialogue generation in a plug-and-play manner. Experimental results demonstrate that EmoDiag significantly outperforms baseline models in empathetic dialogue generation tasks and enhances the empathetic capacity of LLMs, while maintaining high-quality text generation in terms of diversity, fluency, and relevance."

    "abstract": "3D object detection aims to accurately localize and recognize objects in 3D space. It serves as a fundamental task for reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems, enabling the monitoring of diverse traffic participants such as vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, and public transport. Recently, transformer-based methods have gained significant attention in multi-view 3D object detection due to their strong global reasoning capabilities. However, their limited capacity to model spatial positional information hinders accurate object localization, especially in complex and large-scale scenes. To address this limitation, SpaceFormer is proposed as a novel transformer-based multi-view 3D object detector. Specifically, a Contextual Visual Prompts Learning strategy is proposed to enhance the perception of small and sparse traffic participants by incorporating contextual priors. To further suppress background interference, a Semantics-guided Depth Estimation method is proposed to refine depth representations using high-level semantic information. Furthermore, a Spatial Position Embedding mechanism is proposed to improve the spatial localization capability of the transformer by integrating geometric position and polar spatial embedding. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that SpaceFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance with 55.5% mAP and 62.9% NDS. These improvements indicate not only methodological advances but also practical benefits for intelligent transportation systems, enhancing safety, reliability, and efficiency in real-world deployments."

Due to these advantages, many studies have been conducted on SMA actuators driven by Joule heating under static air conditions. However, ensuring precise and responsive control of these actuators in diverse and dynamic environmental conditions remains a significant challenge. In particular, the implementation of efficient cooling mechanisms—such as fan-based or liquid-based cooling—for rapid operation is critical for practical applications but still underexplored. Herein, we introduce a durable and adaptive SMA actuation system that operates under randomly generated current conditions. This system enables reliable prediction of SMA output force using machine learning models, even as environmental conditions change. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is trained to predict the output force of SMA coils using time-series inputs of current, electrical resistance, and environmental temperature. This model is validated under both static air and flowing water conditions with varying temperatures and flow rates. Furthermore, we demonstrate a closed-loop feedback control strategy for the SMA actuator, highlighting its potential for precise and robust operation across diverse environments."

    "abstract": "Planning the trajectory for an autonomous vehicle (AV) requires considering both the AV's objectives and the behaviors of surrounding agents, which interact in a dynamic process. Joint prediction and planning (JPP) methods have been proposed to model this bidirectional interaction and generate compatible joint futures. However, existing methods often overlook the fundamental differences between the two tasks and treat them almost identically, thus limiting the effect of planning. In this work, we revisit JPP from a role-aware perspective and identify three inherent asymmetries between prediction and planning: information, objective, and feedback. Based on these insights, we propose the Role-Aware Joint Prediction and Planning (RAP) framework, which explicitly differentiates the treatment of the ego vehicle and surrounding agents through three lightweight asymmetric designs. Specifically, RAP introduces a route–identity token pairing mechanism for route-aware yet agent-agnostic conditioning, ego-only vectorized auxiliary losses for safety-constrained planning, and dropout and perturbation applied to the ego's history and kinematic state to improve closed-loop robustness. Comprehensive experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that RAP achieves state-of the-art performance on both open-loop and closed-loop metrics, validating the effectiveness of asymmetric modeling in unified prediction and planning."

    "abstract": "While considerable research has been dedicated to the prediction of area trip demand, relatively little attention has been paid to the area trip attraction prediction problem. A primary challenge in short-term trip attraction prediction stems from the partial observability of destination information, as trips are either still en route or have recently arrived but not yet confirmed as completed, leading to delayed and incomplete measurement of attraction dynamics. This paper proposes the field theory-guided area trip attraction prediction fusion network (FG-ATAPFN), which leverages potential energy fields (PEFs) to model underlying physical principles of urban dynamics. Furthermore, it establishes a connection between trip attraction and traffic flow through the continuity equation derived from field theory. FG-ATAPFN consists of three pivotal components: spatial-temporal Transformer to model spatial-temporal dependencies in historical area trip attraction sequences effectively, an OD flow PEF prediction network to derive precise trip destination insights, and an edge flow PEF prediction network to track and predict real-time human mobility flows dynamically, all leveraging both historical and real-time data to enable a comprehensive and precise analysis of travel behaviors within urban transportation systems. The proposed model is validated on an open-sourced real-world dataset comprising human movement trajectories from 100,000 users in Nagoya, Japan, and benchmarked against state-of-the-art prediction models. Experimental results indicate that FG-ATAPFN achieves a 15.5% reduction in mean absolute percentage error, surpassing baseline models in predicting trip attraction. We demonstrate that field theory effectively enhances the accuracy of trip attraction prediction, which is critical for optimizing transportation infrastructure design and guiding urban policy."

    "abstract": "Vehicle platoon offers numerous benefits in terms of road safety, energy efficiency, and traffic management in urban freight delivery. Privacy preservation is critical here: location information ties to customer confidentiality and reputation guarantees platoon reliability, yet most existing platoon management schemes fail to preserve privacy while achieving vehicle location-matching. Meanwhile, traditional distance calculation methods such as Euclidean distance are unsuitable for urban road layouts, and most schemes assume member vehicles must follow to unified endpoints, a rigid constraint conflicting with the scenario's needs. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving platoon management scheme for flexible platoon splitting in urban freight delivery (PPFPS). In detail, the PPFPS scheme leverages location and reputation to achieve flexible platoon splitting in platoon management while preserving vehicle privacy. Specially, we design an encrypted Manhattan distance calculation method (EMC) by combining bloom filters and Paillier cryptosystem, which is tailored to the road layouts in urban environments and deployed on cloud servers. The EMC method enables privacy-preserving location matching to achieve flexible platoon splitting, and reputation is used to ensure the reliability of vehicle platoon. Furthermore, the EMC method significantly minimizes the involvement of the trusted authority by introducing cloud-assisted approaches. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the PPFPS scheme effectively preserves privacy and defends a variety of potential attacks. Simulation evaluation confirms that the PPFPS scheme supports more functions while significantly reducing computation overheads by 66.59% to 78.72% on the TA side, and maintains communication overheads of the similar order of magnitude as the existing schemes."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of mobile technologies, including self-driving cars and drones, the deployment of mobile software has become increasingly complex. In this context, virtualization plays a pivotal role by simplifying service deployment through containers and enabling container orchestration plat forms to efficiently manage an expanding number of container clusters. This is achieved by leveraging standardized interfaces and minimizing resource optimization overhead. However, the use of distributed servers in mobile edge clusters introduces several challenges, such as bandwidth limitations, network performance fluctuations, and resource constraints, which complicate deployment in these dynamic and resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we rethink the layer-based structure, a fundamental container design, and analyze the challenges and potential of real edge platform traces. Consequently, we propose BREAK, an acceleration middleware for efficient container deployment. With the primary insight of enhancing layer-reuse and deriving benefits from it, we develop a co-design approach centered on layer structure for efficient deployment, ensuring backward compatibility: (i) a container image refactoring solution that optimizes efficiency while preserving the stack-of-layers structure, (ii) distributed shared layer-stack caches, dynamically optimized for collaborative container deployment among mobile edge clusters, (iii) a customized Kubernetes (K8s) scheduler extending awareness of network performance, disk space, and container layer cache for container placement, and (iv) a tailored storage-driver of the standard container runtime for efficient layer extraction. Results indicate that BREAK accelerates the deployment process by up to 2.1× and reduces redundant image size by up to 3.11× compared to the state-of-the-art approach."

    "abstract": "Reliable and timely data collection poses a significant challenge for underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), primarily due to the extremely low data rate of underwater communication and the difficulty in supplying energy to the sensor nodes. In this paper, we explore the use of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for sequential data collection from sensor nodes distributed over a large area. To facilitate efficient data collection, appropriate cluster heads (CHs) are selected in each region to collect and aggregate data from nearby energy-limited sensor nodes, and then forward the data to the mobile AUVs. Specifically, we investigate how to maximize the value of information (VoI) of the collected data through the joint optimization of CH selection and multi-AUV path planning, while accounting for the energy constraints of sensor nodes. To tackle the formulated VoI maximization problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on an encoder-decoder architecture. The whole UWSN system is fed into the encoder network, followed by a composite decoder consisting of an AUV selection decoder and a cluster access sequence decoder to generate the cluster access sequence for each AUV. Based on the determined sequences, we further utilize the dynamic programming algorithm to achieve optimal CH selection. Finally, we obtain the sequence of AUVs that access the selected CHs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based approach converges and achieves a higher VoI than existing benchmark algorithms."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth and widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) have led to increasing demand for accurate, privacy-preserving time series prediction in EV charging ecosystems. While federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving framework, conventional centralized FL suffers from communication bottleneck, single point of failure, and training inefficiency caused by synchronous updates in heterogeneous environments. To address these challenges, we propose decentralized synchronous federated learning (DeSFL) and its asynchronous variant DeAFL for time series prediction in EV charging ecosystems. Both methods eliminate the need for centralized coordination. DeSFL provides synchronous updates for homogeneous environments, while DeAFL supports asynchronous updates to enhance efficiency and robustness for heterogeneous environments in real-world applications. In order to handle scenarios in EV charging ecosystems where geographical information is unavailable or unreliable, we introduce an adaptive dynamic directed communication topology graph (AD<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>CTG) algorithm that optimizes communication efficiency without sacrificing model performance. Experimental results on four real-world EV-related datasets demonstrate that both DeSFL and DeAFL achieve superior prediction accuracy compared to centralized baselines."

SPARQ integrates satellites (space layer), unmanned aerial vehicles (air layer), and remote end users (ground layer) to perform end-to-end entanglement distribution. We first present the architecture of SPARQ, followed by a discussion of its potential applications as well as the challenges facing SPARQ. Next, we investigate one of SPARQ's challenges, the need for efficient routing algorithms. This challenge is particularly significant for SPARQ because of the presence of three layers with diverse distances and capabilities among the nodes, which makes the existing routing algorithms inefficient. Hence, we propose a routing strategy that adopts entanglement fidelity as a routing metric and specifies optimal end-to-end entangled paths while avoiding intensive resource usage. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the SPARQ architecture and the proposed routing algorithm. Specifically, SPARQ achieves up to a 5.5% improvement in entanglement fidelity, a 49% increase in entanglement distribution efficiency, and a 10-fold increase in the average number of served requests. The proposed routing algorithm also achieves up to a 7% improvement in entanglement fidelity and a 9-fold increase in the average number of served requests. Finally, we present the conclusion and future directions."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a triaxial Helmholtz coil instrument that generates position-independent magnetic gradients for microrobot force actuation without auxiliary Maxwell coils. By independent driving six coils with asymmetric current pairs, the system decouples the three Cartesian force components. We derive a fixed actuation matrix that maps coil currents to magnetic field and gradient, via COMSOL-assisted modeling combined with in situ triaxial-magnetometer calibration. Simulation and experimental measurements show 99% agreement across a 40×40×40 mm3 workspace, confirming near-uniform gradients without any position-dependent look-up table. This fixed-matrix approach is particularly useful when real-time vision-based feedback is intermittent or unavailable (e.g., ocular surgery or combat-related injuries with opacity or bleeding). To address ill-conditioning and current limits, we consider Tikhonov regularization (TR) and truncated space vector decomposition (TSVD) for current allocation. We further validate gradient control by demonstrating open-loop three-dimensional microrobot translations in viscous media. Overall, the proposed system provides a compact, cost-effective, metrology-ground framework for gradient-based magnetic manipulation using a Helmholtz architecture."

    "abstract": "The existing transformer-based equalization systems have the advantages of simple circuitry and ease of control. However, their application in large-scale energy storage systems is often hampered by scalability issues, as the number of magnetic components typically scales linearly with the cell count. A bidirectional LLC-based integrated equalizer employing a parallel modular transformer architecture to overcome this scalability challenge in large-scale energy storage systems is proposed. By leveraging the symmetrical voltage and current waveforms inherent to the LLC converter, the proposed equalizer enables a single secondary winding to balance two adjacent cells, thereby halving the required number of transformers. Furthermore, the proposed circuit can achieve balancing during charging, discharging, and idle states in the energy storage system. The proposed design was validated on an eight-cell supercapacitor prototype, demonstrating rapid voltage convergence under all operating conditions. The system achieved peak efficiencies of 95.5% (charging) and 95.7% (discharging) within a 10 W to 30 W power range."

Existing approaches based on static compression or heuristic selection do not adapt to the receiver's current query or to contention on a shared channel, which leads to redundant transmission or missing task-critical details. We propose Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Semantic Communication (RAMSemCom), a receiver-driven framework that iteratively retrieves only high-resolution image patches most relevant to the active task when the initial downsampled summary is insufficient. A centralized Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) scheduler at the roadside unit coordinates per-agent patch budgets and timing under shared bandwidth and round deadlines, using semantic relevance and channel state to orchestrate concurrent requests. Retrieved patches are overlaid via a spatial-awareness layout to preserve scene geometry without full-frame transfer. In a multi-vehicle urban driving case study, RAMSemCom achieves earlier task completion and better performance than strong non-learning and token-level baselines under identical bandwidth and latency budgets."

    "abstract": "In the challenging underwater imaging environment, underwater images often suffer from mixed degradations. Current methods are often insufficient to comprehensively address the issues of light, color, and contrast. To tackle this, we propose a novel text-image joint learning approach called multi-color attribute information fusion (MCAIF), which consists of four enhancement branches for brightness, color, contrast, and fusion, respectively. Initially, we use paired text prompts to supervise the learning of branches in a contrastive manner. To fully use the interdependence of four branches, an implicit interaction module is proposed to facilitate color attribute information collaborative communication. In view of the significant color degradation in underwater images, neural operators are presented to enhance the input image through deep filtering, which includes not only the raw channels, but also the assisted channels by utilizing a learning-based white balance model. Extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets, including the T200 test set that we collected to evaluate the overall performance of UIE algorithms. Experimental results across datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, producing visually pleasing results that align markedly better with human perception."

    "abstract": "In the domain of autonomous systems, the integration of multiple heterogeneous sensors represented by global navigation satellite system (GNSS), cameras, and inertial measurement units (IMU) has been widely employed to achieve robust navigation performance. In addition, with the miniaturization and cost reduction of sensors, homogeneous sensors' integration platforms become available for both manufacturing and application. This article proposes a tightly coupled system with multiple GNSS terminals and multiple IMUs, aiming to improve vehicle navigation performance. First, a weighted least squares based synthetic IMU generator is designed to fuse multiple IMU measurements to attenuate the noise. Besides, double-difference pseudorange and carrier phase measurements from multiple GNSS, along with measurements from the low-noise synthetic IMU, are tightly fused in a stacked estimator. This enriches GNSS observations with enhanced satellite geometry and improves IMU propagation accuracy. Through real-world onboard experiments and a simulation test in different scenarios, it is shown that in GNSS-challenged environments, the proposed method maintains horizontal centimeter-level positioning accuracy and achieves an ambiguity resolution rate exceeding 90%. Even in GNSS-denied environments, it can significantly suppress the drift of positioning errors."

The empirical setting is a qualitative comparison of PPPs from 12 smart city initiatives in Taiwan. We ensure methodological rigor through representative case sampling, multi-source data triangulation, iterative cross-case comparison, and validation via peer debriefing and practitioner feedback. Our findings indicate that smart city PPPs can be categorized based on the role of the central actors in bridging the public and private sectors. There are four forms of PPPs: national, functional, dominant, and financial. Each form is equifinal in effectiveness, yet distinct in its central actors, negotiation power between the public and private sectors, financial performance, public objectives, and applicable conditions. Our analysis offers practitioners a foundation for designing effective governance structures for smart city PPPs."

    "abstract": "Existing multimodal point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) methods usually integrate 3D and 2D information to simulate human visual perception of distortions. However, due to the lack of consideration of spatial correspondence, they have difficulty to learn consistent distortion representations from different modalities in the same region of the PC. In addition, they also ignore the heterogeneity of modalities and rely on complex fusion mechanisms (e.g., attention) to integrate multimodal features. Both lead to limited performance and increased computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a novel double alignment multimodal learning network (DA-Net), which introduces two key alignment strategies. Specifically, the first is spatial pre-alignment strategy, which generates informative 2D patch for each 3D patch via an adaptive patch projection module (APPM), ensuring accurate spatial correspondence of different modalities prior to feature extraction. The second is a uniform feature alignment strategy, which includes feature disentanglement module (FDM) and feature mapping module (FMM) to relieve heterogeneity of modalities and guide the optimization of 2D and 3D encoder. Finally, multimodal features are simply integrated and regressed to obtain the quality score. Experimental results demonstrate that the DA-Net exhibits outstanding performance and generalization ability. It also achieves lower computational complexity compared with other multimodal PCQA methods. The source codes of DA-Net will be available at https://github.com/Rphone/DA-Net."

    "abstract": "Traditional quantitative genetics rely on known pedigrees for estimating polygenic breeding values and variance components. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing, estimation of empirical relationships between individuals have become feasible. The single-step genomic BLUP procedure integrates polygenic and genomic information but requires intricate pedigree connections, leading to computationally demanding matrix operations. Here, we propose DYpREG, a flexible proximal operator multi-objective regularization method. DYpREG is a splitting algorithm that accommodates two distinct loss functions and a regularization function that can be chosen as LASSO, ridge regression (RR) or elastic net (EN). Notably, it incorporates pre-calculated breeding values without the need for extensive relationship matrix computations. Evaluated on two traits with different heritabilities from mice and pig, DYpREG with RR regularizer showed the best predictive performance compared to DYpREG with LASSO and EN regularizers as well as to all methods lacking polygenic information. The mean squared error (MSE) reduction was notable for both mice traits (1.5% and 24.77%) and both pig traits (2.8% and 2.1%). Comparative analyses with Bayesian reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and spike-and-slab (BayesC) regression also revealed consistent improvements. Hence, DYpREG effectively integrates polygenic information, enhancing prediction accuracy in genomic evaluations."

    "abstract": "Monocular one-dimensional galvanometer scanning systems have been widely used in the field of non-contact 3D scanning. However, this system has extremely high requirements for the temporal synchronization between motor control and camera acquisition, as well as the assembly accuracy of the mechanical structure. This paper proposes an online calibration method driven by image feature point data: by introducing an auxiliary structured light system, the intersection points of the Auxiliary Structured Light (ASL) and Measurement Structured Light (MSL) are used as the feature points input to the system, and a residual neural network (ResNet) is employed to realize the mapping process from feature point data to the MSL light plane normal vector. The acquisition of driving data required for the MSL calibration model and the measurement process are completely synchronized on the time axis, which avoids the problem of requiring synchronization between image and encoder data acquisition, and bypasses the rotation axis calibration process in the traditional physical model. In addition, based on the invariance of projective lines, this paper also proposes a dataset construction method and a two-stage training method suitable for this system. This dataset construction method can simplify the acquisition process of data required for neural network training, and the two-stage training mode can suppress the overfitting phenomenon during the training process and improve the generalization ability of the network. Experiments show that the diameter fitting error of the 3D reconstruction of the target sphere by this system is less than 40 μm."

    "abstract": "GaN power devices are renowned for enabling high frequency operation, but this merit has been largely demonstrated only in low-voltage realms. Recently, GaN-on-sapphire devices have emerged as promising candidates for kilovolt applications; however, their monolithic integration for high-frequency operation remains unexplored. Here we bridge this gap by demonstrating a monolithically integrated GaN-on-sapphire diode bridge integrated circuit (IC) that enables a kilovolt voltage multiplier operating at ultra-high frequencies up to 10 MHz. The IC integrates four field-plated Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) within a compact 4 × 4 mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> QFN package. Compared to discrete diode bridges, monolithic design reduces stray capacitance and other parasitics from individual packages and interconnects. The four SBDs uniformly exhibit kilovolt dynamic breakdown voltage and temperature-independent capacitance. The voltage multiplier can rectify a 10 MHz AC input to >1000 V DC output, achieving a high multiplication gain of 3.83 across input frequencies from 100 kHz to 10 MHz and a stable performance across ambient temperatures ranging from 22°C to 115°C. The frequency, multiplication gain, and DC output voltage are among the highest reported for voltage multipliers to date. Meanwhile, identical voltage multiplier setups using discrete Si and SiC diodes fail to achieve simultaneous 1000 V and 10 MHz operation. These results reveal the potentials of GaN-on-sapphire power ICs as key enablers for future kilovolt, megahertz power electronics."

First, flux cancellation is employed to design a four-phase NCI without core center column. Next, comprehensive mathematical models of NCI are established considering essential parameters. Subsequently, the Pareto Front of the objective function and converter efficiency constraint is identified through the multi-objective optimization based on the modeling results, enabling trade-off for optimal parameters selection of NCI. Finally, an experimental prototype of 300W demonstrates that compared to separate inductors (SI), NCI reduces footprint and volume by 41.31% and 60.90% respectively, while achieving the magnetic device power density of 7376W/in³, the 1.45% improvement of rated efficiency and better transient performance of IBC."

    "abstract": "With the large-scale deployment of low earth orbit satellite network (LEO-SN), end-to-end (E2E) delay analysis under multi-traffic faces significant challenges from time-varying service capabilities, propagation delay-induced queue coupling, dynamic resource contention, etc. In this paper, we develop a martingale-based analytical framework to E2E delay violation probability in multi-hop, multi-traffic LEO-SN scenarios. First, bursty traffic arrivals are modeled through a Markov chain Monte Carlo process, while satellite-to-ground and inter-satellite link dynamics are captured through finite-state Markov channels, forming the basis for single-hop queuing analysis. We then extend stochastic network calculus to quantify queue coupling effects due to propagation delay and incorporate dynamic residual service allocation under a priority scheduling mechanism. To address the compounded complexity of multi-hop, multi-traffic interactions, we apply martingale theory and the stopping time theorem to derive closed-form upper bounds on backlog and delay violation probability. Furthermore, we introduce global and hierarchical stability conditions that characterize priority scheduling constraints and a scaling factor to reflect service heterogeneity across links. Extensive simulations validate the tightness of our bounds and demonstrate that, although priority scheduling significantly improves delay performance for higher-priority traffic, imbalanced link loads and transient service interruptions can amplify delay variability."

    "abstract": "Engineering design is a complex process that involves balancing various performance trade-offs, requiring both the expertise of skilled designers and significant costs. In recent years, the introduction of machine learning techniques has raised expectations for automating the design process and reducing associated costs. However, the high dimensionality of design spaces and the scarcity of training data remain major obstacles to practical deployment. This paper proposes a novel method for generating diverse and realistic design candidates in a conditional manner by leveraging image generation techniques, based on the observation that three-dimensional (3D) shapes can be represented as two-dimensional (2D) images without significant loss of information. The proposed model, named ConStruct-LDM, effectively extracts global features of shapes using VQ-VAE-2 and performs efficient generation in the latent space via a Latent Diffusion Model. Additionally, we introduce zero-initialization for conditional inputs to enhance training stability. We apply the proposed method to hull form design and demonstrate substantial improvements in all evaluation metrics compared to conventional approaches. Furthermore, we show that the generated shapes can serve as effective data augmentation for downstream tasks, highlighting the practicality of the method in real-world design workflows. Our approach enables both the acceleration of the design process and the expansion of the design space, indicating the potential applicability of generative AI not only in ship design but also in other engineering shape design domains."

Our approach addresses the limitations of current Gaussian-based methods, which primarily focus on static 3D scene understanding and struggle with geometrically accurate object segmentation in complex dynamic scenes. To ensure robust object-level segmentation, we first integrate Grounded SAM 2, which enables text prompt-based object selection and tracking. We then learn a set of Gaussian surfels for object geometry representation and employ a marginal 1D Gaussian for dynamic modeling at each timestamp. To improve geometric quality when modeling surfaces, we use depth and surface normal for geometric regularization. Furthermore, to address continuity and flickering issues in complex scenes, we implement dynamic-aware regularization to maintain temporal consistency. This approach allows us to capture object motion and morphing over time while maintaining spatial coherence. To the best of our knowledge, ST-ObjGS is the first self-supervised approach using Space-time Gaussian surfels for consistent segmentation of dynamic 3D objects in real-world scenes. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks including PKU-DyMVHumans, Plenoptic Video, Google Immersive, and CMU Panoptic datasets demonstrate that ST-ObjGS produces more precise object masks than its Gaussian-based counterparts and significantly outperforms supervised single-view baselines."

    "abstract": "Radio frequency (RF)-based imaging plays a pivotal role in sensing applications due to its robustness against visibility constraints and environmental factors. Among various RF imaging technologies, impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) stands out by offering both fine temporal resolution and penetration capabilities. Existing work is limited to planar or depth imaging with multipath suppression. However, achieving depth imaging exploiting multipath IR-UWB signals and further realizing penetration imaging remains a challenge. To address it, this paper proposes a novel neural network architecture that uses IR-UWB signals to reconstruct depth and penetration images. First, we give a feasibility analysis of the dual imaging tasks using IR-UWB signals in an enclosed environment with multipath effects. Then, a theoretical spatial geometric inverse model is presented to formulate depth and penetration imaging as a joint optimization problem. Next, to address the ill-posed and intractable nature of the optimization problem, we propose a neural network architecture named the attention-enhanced depth and penetration imaging network (AEDPI-Net) as an approximate solver. AEDPI-Net employs a shared encoder to extract common features from IR-UWB signals, which are subsequently mapped by two parallel decoders into depth and penetration images. Finally, extensive experimental studies on an IR-UWB imaging platform verify the effectiveness of AEDPI-Net. The results reveal that AEDPI-Net achieves superior depth and penetration imaging performance compared to the baseline methods."

This paper aims to address two challenges in using a permissioned blockchain for ITS: 1) ensuring the legitimacy and timeliness of vehicles together to join the permissioned blockchain and 2) maintaining the availability of contextually relevant, fast-moving vehicles to serve as endorsers for reliable consensus on traffic event verification at road junctions. This paper introduces V-Trust, an integrated system for a location specific PBFT-based blockchain network enhanced with Location Certificate, Fast Joining Protocol, Network Prefetch, Dynamic Endorsers Management, and Delayed Endorsement. These components ensure 1) the legitimacy and quickness of vehicles to join a permissioned blockchain, 2) the selection of contextually relevant vehicles for endorsing a traffic event, and 3) the improvement of endorser availability by allowing legitimate and contextually relevant vehicles to participate in the consensus even after leaving the junction. The V-Trust was simulated and evaluated using ns-3 with a 4G LTE setup. The evaluation results confirmed that V-Trust enables a vehicle to join a PBFT network with one bidirectional message exchange (virtually 1 RTT using a persistent TCP connection) between a vehicle and a Roadside Unit (RSU) and the communication overhead of O(1)."

    "abstract": "Human emotion is expressed in many communication modalities and media formats and so their computational study is equally diversified into natural language processing, speech processing, computer vision, etc. Similarly, a large variety of representation formats has been used in previous research to describe emotions (polarity scales, basic emotion categories, dimensional approaches, appraisal theory, etc.) and has led to an ever proliferating diversity of datasets, predictive models, and software tools for emotion analysis. Because of these two distinct types of heterogeneity, at the expressional and representational level, there is a dire need to unify previous work on increasingly diverging data and label types. This article presents such a unifying computational model. We propose a training procedure that learns a shared latent representation for emotions, so-called emotion embeddings, independent of different natural languages, communication modalities, media or representation label formats, and even disparate model architectures. Experiments on a wide range of heterogeneous affective datasets indicate that this approach yields the desired interoperability for the sake of reusability, interpretability and flexibility, without penalizing prediction quality.

    "abstract": "As power systems shift toward inverter-based resources (IBRs), maintaining stability depends on both total available inertia and system strength. This paper addresses frequency security by determining the required frequency response reserves (FRR) as an explicit function of the short-circuit capacity (SCC) at the renewable interconnection bus. For a fixed contingency, lower SCC at the connection point increases the required FRR and raises the secure operating level of inertia (SOLI); conversely, higher SCC reduces both for the same event. We show that, for a fixed contingency and nadir standard, lower local SCC at the renewable interconnection bus systematically increases both the required FRR and the SOLI. This SCC–FRR formulation enables system operators to set region-specific FRR targets and to assess the impact of renewable siting in weak versus strong areas without changing the underlying frequency-security standard. We substantiate this with a regional analysis on KEPCO’s system, using data-driven operating snapshots and dynamic frequency simulations for three areas with different SCC and renewable siting patterns. The results reveal local system strength differences across areas and demonstrate that relocating renewable connections alters FRR needs and shifts SOLI in proportion to local SCC. Jeonnam needs approximately 14–23% higher SOLI and 28–45% more FRR than other areas under the same nadir criterion."

    "abstract": "Efficient AC–DC interfaces are essential for low-power energy harvesters to power intracardiac leadless pacemakers (ICLPs) reliably. For the front-end circuitry, selecting a diode that minimizes both conduction and leakage losses under specified operating conditions is challenging, as the forward voltage drop and reverse leakage current cannot be simultaneously reduced due to the device’s inherent physics. This brief presents a machine learning framework that predicts the DC output of diode-based AC-DC interfaces directly from specific voltage-current (V-I) characteristic points of the diodes and descriptive features of the excitation waveform. A physics-informed surrogate model is trained on SPICE-simulated data of rectifiers driven by experimentally captured cardiac harvester waveforms. Hardware validation with printed-circuit rectifiers powered by the same harvester source exhibits an average error of 0.03 V between prediction and measurement, matching the performance observed on the synthetic set and demonstrating robust generalization to real-world applications. This data-driven approach offers an instant, datasheet-only diode screening without circuit-level evaluation and can be integrated into automated multi-objective optimization flows for the design of low-power energy harvester AC–DC interfaces."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to enhance cyber defense operations by providing novel capabilities that support human operators in high-stakes environments, such as decision assistance, automation, and after-action reviews. Effective AI support in cyber defense must adapt to the cognitive profiles and decision tendencies of human operators. These environments pose unique challenges: decisions are time-critical, threats evolve in an adversarial manner, and human behavior is heterogeneous and difficult to infer from limited data. We address these by inferring cognitive traits, such as risk tolerance, curiosity, and prospect, that govern individual decision-making tendencies. Our goal is not to replicate user behavior, but to understand it, using personalized models to enable riskaware guidance and intervention. Such models support trust calibration, role assignment, and personalized training. They also enable differentiated guidance strategies for novice and expert users, all while preserving mission safety. We propose a kernel–based inverse learning framework that infers userspecific latent cognitive traits from limited behavioral data. Human decision-making is formulated as a Markov Decision Process, explicitly modeling how individual defenders perceive and respond to evolving threats. We validate our approach using a psychological survey from 108 participants in the TTCP CAGE Challenge 2 testbed. Results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately recovers individualized traits and has strong predictive accuracy, even under sparse data and behavioral variability. Unlike prior approaches, the proposed framework provides a cognitively interpretable foundation for assistive AI systems, enabling them to anticipate and adapt to diverse user decision-making styles."

Although high amounts of Photovoltaic (PV) penetration introduce significant uncertainties that degrade traditional forecasting models. In this study, a hybrid model Is introduced which utilizes an ARIMA model to capture linear trends while using Gradient Boosting (GB) to model nonlinear residuals. The proposed methodology was validated using real-time data, compared with conventional methods under varying amounts of PV penetration levels. The proposed methodology consistently achieved lower load forecasting errors than the other tested methods, with mean absolute percentage error values remaining approximately 1%, even at 70% PV penetration, while maintaining competitive computation times demonstrating its suitability for load forecasting in grids with high levels of PV integration."

    "abstract": "The jumping motion of wheel-legged robots (WLR) is of great significance to their obstacle-crossing ability. In existing studies, a Vertical Jumping (VJ) scheme that mimics human-like jumping has been realized in WLRs. However, the capacity limit of the actuator severely restricts the height of the wheel off the ground that VJ can reach, that is, the effective jumping height which directly affects the ability to cross obstacles. To enhance the effective jumping height within the actuator’s capacity, this paper proposes the Aerial Leg-Swing Jumping (ALSJ) scheme. By analyzing the take-off and flight phases from an energy perspective, the ALSJ scheme is designed to reduce peak torque and energy consumption. The implementation framework of the proposed scheme includes a vertical reachability map, a phased optimization planning method, and an offset-free whole-body control strategy. Simulation results show that, compared to the VJ scheme, the proposed scheme increases the maximum achievable effective jumping height by about 31.03% within actuator constraints. Additionally, these two schemes are compared in hardware experiments under a test condition with a desired jumping height of 0.15 m, and the flight time constraint of 0.32 s is introduced in ALSJ scheme to enhance the practical significance of the jump. Using the ALSJ scheme, the energy consumption during take-off phase is reduced by 16.23%, the total energy consumption throughout the entire jumping process is decreased by approximately 9.78%, and the peak knee joint torque is decreased by 32.57 Nm, further validating the effectiveness of the proposed scheme."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of location-based services and the Internet of Things, high-accuracy positioning on smartphones is increasingly in demand. However, low-cost embedded antennas and chips limit the availability and quality of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurement, making it challenging to achieve reliable positioning in complex urban environments. The PPP-RTK method, which combines the advantages of the traditional Precise Point Positioning (PPP) and Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) method, has capability to provide high-accuracy positioning service for unlimited number of users under a large-scale area. In this paper, we customize and optimize a PPP-RTK framework based on factor graph optimization (FGO) for smartphones, aiming to achieve high accuracy positioning in urban harsh environments. To make full use of the historical observations, this framework combines raw code, phase, Doppler observations and atmospheric corrections with ambiguity management and marginalization strategy in the sliding window for fast convergence and accurate parameter estimation. The M-estimation method known as Huber loss is also integrated in FGO framework for improve the robustness of positioning. Dynamic urban experiments using Xiaomi Mi8 smartphone demonstrate that the proposed framework reduces 3D Root Mean Square (RMS) errors by 43.47% and 37.28% in two datasets compared to traditional Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) method. Evaluations in urban typical environments confirm its superior performance under degraded observation conditions. This enhancement illustrates the framework’s ability for precise, and robust positioning in low-cost devices across urban diverse environments."

    "abstract": "With the great success of diffusion models in image generation, diffusion-based image compression is attracting increasing interests. However, due to the random noise introduced in the diffusion learning, they usually produce reconstructions with deviation from the original images, leading to suboptimal compression results. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a Noise Constrained Diffusion (NC-Diffusion) framework for high fidelity image compression. Unlike existing diffusion-based compression methods that add random Gaussian noise and direct the noise into the image space, the proposed NC-Diffusion formulates the quantization noise originally added in the learned image compression as the noise in the forward process of diffusion. Then a noise constrained diffusion process is constructed from the ground-truth image to the initial compression result generated with quantization noise. The NC-Diffusion overcomes the problem of noise mismatch between compression and diffusion, significantly improving the inference efficiency. In addition, an adaptive frequency-domain filtering module is developed to enhance the skip connections in the U-Net based diffusion architecture, in order to enhance high-frequency details. Moreover, a zero-shot sample-guided enhancement method is designed to further improve the fidelity of the image. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve the best performance compared with existing methods."

    "abstract": "Sustainable agricultural microgrids have emerged as a promising solution to address reliable power supply issues in remote regions by integrating renewable energy sources and energy storage systems. However, the inherent intermittency of renewable resources and the lack of reliable communication infrastructure hinder efficient energy coordination and system stability. This paper proposes a composite model predictive control based decentralized coordination strategy for sustainable agricultural microgrids using hydrogen-battery hybrid energy storage systems. This strategy achieves decentralized dynamic power sharing with optimized transient performance and guaranteed large-signal stability, without relying on real-time communication. The proposed control method incorporates an MPC controller to enhance the dynamic performance of the system and a high-order sliding mode observer to estimate disturbances caused by renewable generation and agricultural load uncertainties. This approach enables smooth power sharing, suppresses current ripple, and ensures system robustness. Additionally, the design is tailored to the characteristics of remote agricultural microgrids by supporting long-term energy storage and mitigating short-term renewable power fluctuations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulations and experiments."

Traditional automated detection systems rely on handcrafted acoustic features, including mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, that may discard diagnostically relevant temporal dynamics through fixed spectral transformations. Drawing inspiration from cognitive neuroscience models of hierarchical speech processing, we propose the neuro residual acoustic learning framework, an end-to-end system operating directly on raw waveforms while incorporating architectural principles mirroring biological auditory pathways. The framework implements acoustic-symbolic transformation bridging continuous signals and discrete phonetic-acoustic categories analogous to primary auditory cortex processing, hierarchical temporal encoding through residual blocks with dilated convolutions capturing multi-scale patterns across phoneme to utterance timescales, and squeeze-and-excitation attention mechanisms modeling prefrontal modulation of temporal representations. Evaluation on NCMMSC2021 Mandarin speech demonstrates 86.55% accuracy on extended utterances and 81.35% on brief segments, surpassing contemporary methods, including multimodal architectures and large language model hybrids, by 2.88% and 2.43% respectively. Cross-linguistic validation on INTERSPEECH2020 ADReSS English speech achieves 70.83% accuracy, exceeding baselines by 2.08%. Confusion matrix analysis reveals 93.3% healthy control recall and asymmetric Alzheimer's disease versus mild cognitive impairment misclassification patterns consistent with prodromal acoustic biomarkers."

Several attack and defense models have been proposed to date for models focusing on balanced datasets. However, the adversarial robustness study for imbalanced (long-tailed) datasets has rarely been investigated. Recently, a study investigated the combination of re-balancing tricks focusing on adversarial robustness. However, such adversarial training may not be suitable for long-tailed robustness. We observe that the adversarial samples from long-tailed datasets require additional exploration divergence in the sampling space.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method. i.e., RbDAT outperforms the SOTA method with a clear margin of 5.01% under a projected gradient descent (PGD) attack on the CIFAR-10-LT dataset."

    "abstract": "Millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) MIMO systems typically rely on predefined beamforming codebooks for initial access and data transmission. However, these codebooks are often unoptimized for specific conditions, leading to large sizes and significant beam training overhead, thereby complicating support for highly mobile applications. This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes beam patterns using only receive power measurements, adapting to the environment, user distribution, and hardware constraints without prior channel knowledge. The framework explores three reinforcement learning algorithms: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). While reinforcement learning has shown promise for beamforming, a comprehensive comparative analysis of advanced RL algorithms under a combination of realistic challenges, such as Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) conditions and hardware impairments for adaptive beam codebook design in mmWave/THz systems has been largely unexplored. This paper presents the first such in-depth comparative study. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the SAC algorithm, achieving higher beamforming gain and faster convergence compared to DDPG and TD3 in various scenarios, including LoS and NLoS conditions, even with hardware impairments."

We approach this problem by leveraging the mathematical foundations of 3D observer fields to explore and analyze 3D flows in reference frames that are more suitable to visual analysis than the input reference frame. We design novel interactive tools for determining, filtering, and combining reference frames for observer-aware 3D unsteady flow visualization. We represent the space of reference frame motions in a 3D spatial domain via a 6Dparameter space, in which every observer is a time-dependent curve. Our framework supports operations in this 6D observer space by separately focusing on two 3D subspaces, for 3D translations, and 3D rotations, respectively. We show that this approach facilitates a variety of interactions with 3D flow fields. Building on the interactive selection of observers, we furthermore introduce novel techniques such as observer-aware streamline- and pathline-filtering as well as observer-aware iso surface animations of scalar fluid properties for the enhanced visualization and analysis of 3D unsteady flows. We discuss the theoretical underpinnings as well as practical implementation considerations of our approach, and demonstrate the benefits of its 6+1D observer-based methodology on several 3D unsteady flow datasets."

    "abstract": "Text labels are widely used to convey auxiliary information in visualization and graphic design. The substantial variability in the categories and structures of labeled objects leads to diverse label layouts. Recent single-model learning-based solutions in label placement struggle to capture fine-grained differences between these layouts, which in turn limits their performance. In addition, although human designers often consult previous works to gain design insights, existing label layouts typically serve merely as training data, limiting the extent to which embedded design knowledge can be exploited. To address these challenges, we propose a mixture of cluster-guided experts (MoCE) solution for label placement. In this design, multiple experts jointly refine layout features, with each expert responsible for a specific cluster of layouts. A cluster-based gating function assigns input samples to experts based on representation clustering. We implement this idea through the Label Placement Cluster-guided Experts (LPCE) model, in which a MoCE layer integrates multiple feed-forward networks (FFNs), with each expert composed of a pair of FFNs. Furthermore, we introduce a retrieval augmentation strategy into LPCE, which retrieves and encodes reference layouts for each input sample to enrich its representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LPCE achieves superior performance in label placement, both quantitatively and qualitatively, surpassing a range of state-of-the-art baselines. Our algorithm is available at https://github.com/PingshunZhang/LPCE."

    "abstract": "Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been widely used as the spectral model in multi-channel blind source separation (BSS), where the source power spectral density is expressed as the combination of the basis vectors indicating the source spectral patterns. However, the NMF basis vectors of one source may encode the similar features of the other sources, and thus the estimated separated signal contains components from the interference sources. In this paper, the clustering properties of the low-dimension timbral feature of the sources are exploited to enhance the discriminability of the NMF-based spectral model. Specifically, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is utilized as the prior distribution of the NMF basis vectors for all the sources in the log-Mel spectral domain. Within the GMM, each NMF basis vector is constrained to belong to one of several clusters, which can reduce the overlap between the representative spaces of different sources. Two advanced multichannel methods, i.e., independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA) and fast multichannel NMF, are regularized with the proposed basis clustering regularizer, and the cost function is formulated based on the maximum a posteriori. An alternating update-based optimization rule for GMM, NMF and spatial model parameters is derived using the Majorization-Minimization technique. It is found that the proposed basis clustering regularizer can alleviate the permutation problem in multi-channel BSS. Extensive experiments on both simulated and live-recorded datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms ILRMA and FastMNMF."

    "abstract": "Recently, the emerging Interlaced Magnetic Recording (IMR) technology has substantially improved the areal density of disks by implementing interlaced track layout. While this track layout enhances disk storage capacity, it impairs the flexibility of write positioning. To maintain stable write performance of IMR disks, operations such as Read-Modify-Write (RMW) or Garbage Collection (GC) must be introduced, which inevitably incur extra I/Os. Especially in write-intensive workloads, the excessive additional I/Os exacerbate the write amplification effect, thereby severely degrading the overall performance of IMR disks. Although existing data management strategies strive to reduce extra I/Os via device drivers or system middleware, the semantic disparity between the disk and file system inherently limits these strategies to achieve optimal performance. To address the aforementioned challenge,this paper proposes IMR-Friendly File System (IFFS), an innovative file system tailored for IMR disks. First, we propose a semantic-aware hotness identification algorithm based on Online K-means, which redefines the data hotness metric by exploiting file system semantics to reduce data migration induced by inaccurate data classification. Second, we introduce an I/O-overhead-minimized data placement strategy that adaptively selects between in-place and out-of-place writing modes based on data hotness metrics. Furthermore, this strategy employs a log-transition mechanism to dynamically adjust write positions, effectively mitigating I/O overhead caused by RMWs and scattered read requests. Finally, we implement a multi-factor garbage collection mechanism that incorporates intra-zone data hotness, data layout, fragmentation levels, and other contextual attributes to optimize file system data management efficiency, thereby enhances the read performance on IMR disk-based storage system performance. Experimental results show that IFFS achieves an average bandwidth improvement of 12.96× over EXT4, XFS, F2FS, and the state-of-the-art work in Fio evaluation. Under YCSB workloads, IFFS improves bandwidth by an average of 56.89% while reducing latency by 34.46%."

Nevertheless, light load operation leads to low efficiency in operation because of the loss of ZVS. This article introduces a generalized approach for transformer model using equivalent magnetic circuit/Moreover, dividing the secondary side winding into two unevenly sets of windings impacts the phase shift of the transformer as well as the magnitude of the induced voltage. The zero-voltage switching region can be improved by designing the transformer phase shift angle based on dividing the secondary winding into two unevenly sets of windings to enhance efficiency under light load conditions. The mathematical approach developed allows evaluation of the exact solution for rms currents and power in addition to zero-voltage switching boundaries."

Our experimentation involved various approaches to creating moving posters that respond to environmental data both reactively and interactively, focusing on different design strategies, responsive techniques, and data acquisition methods. We conducted evaluation experiments to assess their production and usage potential, which included organising a hands-on workshop, urban placements, and evaluation sessions with people. Our findings indicate that responsive approaches can promote user customisation, facilitating more effective and engaging message delivery to the audience.

    "abstract": "Real-time traffic sign detection is an integral component of environmental perception for modern intelligent driving systems. While one-stage detectors are favored for their high inference speeds, their practical performance is frequently hampered by real-world complexities, including small or distant objects, significant scale variations, and challenging lighting within cluttered backgrounds. Consequently, achieving robust detection of small-scale traffic signs under diverse conditions remains a persistent challenge. This paper introduces PBM_YOLO, a model that significantly enhances the YOLOv11n baseline to overcome these limitations. We integrate an enhanced Parallelized Patch-aware Attention (PPA) module into the backbone to strengthen feature extraction for small-scale targets. Within the neck, a weighted Bi-directional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) is employed to facilitate more effective multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture is further improved by introducing an additional detection head tailored for small object recognition and adopting the Minimum Point Distance Intersection over Union (MPDIOU) loss function to refine the precision of bounding box regression. Evaluated on an augmented version of the Laboratory for Intelligent and Safe Automobiles (LISA) traffic sign dataset, PBM_YOLO demonstrates marked improvements over its baseline. The model achieves an increase of 9.3 percentage points in Precision, 4.6% in mean Average Precision (mAP) at an IoU threshold of 0.5, and 3.1% in mAP@0.5:0.95. A series of ablation studies confirms the individual and synergistic contributions of the proposed components. As a result, PBM_YOLO presents a robust and accurate framework for traffic sign detection, offering a promising advancement for the development of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS)."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of integrated vehicle-road-cloud systems, RoadSide Units (RSUs) have become crucial for communication in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs). However, RSU failures disrupt real-time vehicle-to-cloud connectivity, exacerbating traffic congestion and safety risks. Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising solution for temporary mobile base stations due to their rapid deployment and flexibility. Nevertheless, the open and dynamic nature of UAV-vehicle communication networks presents critical challenges in achieving both secure communication and lightweight authentication. Furthermore, the unsupervised deployment environment of UAVs makes them particularly vulnerable to physical attacks. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a secure and lightweight UAV-assisted vehicle authentication scheme based on quantum key. The scheme leverages quantum keys, hash functions and XOR to ensure secrecy and traceability of malicious entities. Utilising the Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) and fuzzy extractor to resist physical attacks. A private blockchain architecture is implemented for secure data storage and management. We verify the scheme’s security using the real-or-random (ROR) oracle model and the Scyther tool. The experimental results show that, compared to other schemes, our scheme has a lower overhead, with an average packet loss rate reduction of 11.42% – 28.8% and an average communication delay reduction of 14.41%–63%."

    "abstract": "In database systems, cost estimation for query plans has a variety of uses, including query optimization, resource management, load balancing, query scheduling, performance monitoring, and automated maintenance. Existing methods mainly targeted B-tree-based systems, where costs and cardinality are highly correlated. However, LSM-Trees, due to their unique storage structure, violate the assumptions of existing learning methods, causing cardinality to be irrelevant to cost estimation. In addition, the constantly changing data layout leads to severe data drifts when updating data, preventing current learning based models from accurately estimating costs in an agile way. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-layer end-to end cost estimation model for LSM-Tree-based database systems. This model treats cost estimation as a regression problem and comprises two layers: the storage layer and the query plan layer. The storage layer employs lightweight neural networks to leverage data distribution, provide information to the query plan layer, and address the challenges posed by data drift in LSM Trees. The query plan layer uses the Transformer framework and incorporates structural information to learn the representation of plans. This dual-layer architecture allows our model to effectively embed storage information and query plan tree details. The results show that our proposed model achieves state-of-the art cost estimation accuracy for database systems based on LSM-Trees. Additionally, our architecture significantly reduces the model's updating costs, ensuring robust performance amid frequent data drifts."

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) can be manipulated to exhibit specific behaviors when exposed to specific trigger patterns, without affecting their performance on benign samples, dubbed backdoor attack. Currently, implementing backdoor attacks in physical scenarios still faces significant challenges. Physical attacks are labor-intensive and time-consuming, and the triggers are selected in a manual and heuristic way. Moreover, expanding digital attacks to physical scenarios faces many challenges due to their sensitivity to visual distortions and the absence of counterparts in the real world. To address these challenges, we define a novel trigger called the Visible, Semantic, Sample-specific, and Compatible (VSSC) trigger, to achieve effective, stealthy and robust simultaneously, which can also be effectively deployed in the physical scenario using corresponding objects. To implement the VSSC trigger, we propose an automated pipeline comprising three modules: a trigger selection module that systematically identifies suitable triggers leveraging large language models, a trigger insertion module that employs generative models to seamlessly integrate triggers into images, and a quality assessment module that ensures the natural and successful insertion of triggers through vision-language models. Extensive experimental results and analysis validate the effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness of the VSSC trigger. It can not only maintain robustness under visual distortions but also demonstrates strong practicality in the physical scenario. By providing the first automated pipeline, VSSC transforms physical backdoor attacks from a labor-intensive craft into a systematic and realistic threat to real-world AI systems. We hope the proposed VSSC trigger and implementation approach could inspire future studies on designing more practical triggers in backdoor attacks."

The MIN strategy is employed to address critical safety concerns caused by excessively high velocity in the individual joint. To further improve the adaptivity of the neural dynamics solver, a fuzzy system is integrated to enable adaptive parameter adjustment based on the real-time behavior of MRSs. Specifically, the cooperative control problem is formulated as a linear program incorporating the MIN along with constraints associated with distributed network topology and orientation maintenance, thereby enhancing the safety and effectiveness of MRSs. To efficiently solve the proposed linear program, an LADND solver is developed, which adaptively adjusts its parameter in real time according to the trajectory tracking error and its derivative. Furthermore, theoretical analyses confirm the convergence and robustness of the proposed LADND solver. Simulative and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed LADND-based MIN strategy in cooperative trajectory tracking tasks."

    "abstract": "Deep learning technologies have seen widespread adoption in WiFi-based wireless sensing systems. However, they are inherently vulnerable to adversarial perturbation attacks, which has received little attention within the WiFi sensing community. To more comprehensively understand the potential threats posed by perturbation attacks, we present a novel attack method, named WiIntruder, distinguishing itself with universality, robustness, and stealthiness. This paper intends to provide a catalyst that promotes the assessment of security in existing WiFi-based sensing systems. We achieve the three aforementioned salient features in WiIntruder through the following three steps: (1) Maximizing transferability by differentiating user-state-specific feature spaces across sensing models, thereby enabling a universal perturbation attack vector applicable to a wide range of applications; (2) Mitigating the impact of perturbation signal distortion by optimizing key factors of device synchronization and wireless propagation through a heuristic particle swarm algorithm; and (3) Enhancing the diversity and stealthiness of attack patterns by randomly switching among perturbation surrogates generated by a generative adversarial network. Experimental results confirm the threat posed by WiIntruder to four common WiFi-based services, with the average accuracy decrease by 72.9% under black-box attack scenarios."

Despite these advancements, many existing designs of soft hands still lack effective in-hand vision and the ability for each finger to achieve active multi-degree-of-freedom motion. This paper proposes a cable-driven soft robotic hand that can achieve dexterous grasping and manipulation, vision-guided grasping, vision-based slip detection and compensation, as well as visually servoed in-hand manipulation. The hand has five soft fingers, each capable of independent flexion/extension motion and bidirectional ad/abduction motion. A red-green-blue-depth (RGB-D) camera is integrated into the palm of the soft hand to enable in-hand vision capability. Modeling of the soft hand is established to analyze its kinematics, statics, and manipulability. A series of experiments are conducted to demonstrate its dexterous grasping and manipulation capabilities on a variety of objects. Using 3D point cloud data from the in-palm camera, an effective vision-guided grasping strategy is developed to grasp objects on a table. The in-hand vision also enables slip detection and compensation during grasping to maintain the grasp stability. Furthermore, a hierarchical, visually servoed controller is developed to perform closed-loop in-hand object manipulation. With its high dexterity and visual feedback capabilities, the soft hand will find important applications such as household object manipulation and food picking/sorting, and may also be used as a prosthetic hand or an auxiliary hand for humans."

    "abstract": "Conforming to safety standards often limits collaborative robots' performance and size, restricting their applications despite their capabilities. Planning their motions in human environments involves a trade-off between optimal trajectory planning and quick adaptation to dynamic, unstructured spaces. Traditional trajectory planning methods either use simplified robot models and sacrifice robot's abilities for computational efficiency, or exploit robots' abilities fully but have high computational complexity and rely on substantial pre-computation. This paper introduces an approach for trajectory planning that exploits robot's full motion abilities while planning on-the-fly. In each step of the trajectory execution, it evaluates robot's movement ability using polytope algebra and calculates a time-optimal Trapezoidal Acceleration Profile (TAP) on the remaining trajectory. The method is shown to be near time-optimal (around 5% slower trajectories) by benchmarking it against the state-of-the-art time-optimal method TOPP-RA. The method allows reaching higher velocities (able to plan up to 100% of the robot's kinematic limits) while at the same time lowering the tracking error (under 4mm) than traditional Cartesian Space planning methods. A mock-up experiment demonstrates its efficiency in collaborative waste sorting using a Franka Emika Panda robot."

    "abstract": "The defect of the lighting-emitting diode (LED) chip is inevitable in the manufacturing process, which makes it necessary to classify the defective LED-chips with a robust inspection system to guarantee high production efficiency. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have attracted considerable attention in defect classification. With the miniaturization of chip size, it is difficult to recognize the defective chip using the traditional deep CNN, which obtains the large receptive field of the last layer so that the spatial details are ignored and small defects cannot be detected. To address this issue, we propose a multi-scale content-aware enhancement dual-branch CNN for LED-chip defect classification, which is a shallow network with a strong cross-layer feature extraction ability. Aiming at recognizing different sizes of the defect and filtering the noise, a multi-scale content-aware enhancement module is proposed to highlight the important features and inhibit the noise with three different receptive fields, which is beneficial for the detailed and semantic information extraction. Furthermore, a joint loss is adopted to improve the classification ability and facilitate the recognition of difficult samples. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves high recognition accuracy of 95.258% with a low model complexity, which is superior to state-of-the-art methods."

Previous research has predominantly focused on non-cooperative settings, assuming that the modulation type is known at the receiver. This work addresses the problem of IQI in uplink full-duplex relaying (FDR) systems that employ amplify-and-forward (AF) protocols with unknown modulation and fading conditions. Realistic conditions are introduced by modeling independent IQI at each node. Additionally, we exploited the data detection stage embedded in FDR systems as a valuable auxiliary tool to support the proposed estimator. Theoretical investigation demonstrated that the exact maximum-likelihood (ML) approach to the estimation problem is prohibitively complex for practical use. To address this issue, we implemented a simplified method using the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) procedure, which facilitates the recursive computation of ML estimates. Comparative simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its clear improvements over existing solutions."

    "abstract": "Accurate classification of nuclei is a crucial step in advancing pathology image analysis for disease diagnosis and treatment. Recently, prompt learning has shown great promise in universal nuclei classification for multiple datasets, as it can harvest the common knowledge by representing nuclei semantics across different sources. However, remarkable intra- and cross-dataset variability in nuclei categories and their complicated semantic relationships with numerous nuclei are often observed in distinct image instances, leading to two key challenges of instance variability and semantics ambiguity. In this paper, we propose a universal language-guided nuclei classification framework (ULNC) that leverages prompt-based language supervision to overcome these obstacles at the instance level. To address the instance variability issue, we introduce an innovative prompt learning approach that fully exploits unique contextual information of each image instance and generates instance-aware text embeddings highly adaptable to the categorical semantics of varied data sources. Additionally, to tackle the problem of semantics ambiguity, we employ a local vision-language matching loss that explicitly reinforces semantic connections between localized image regions and text prompts for nuclei categories, thus promoting the universal model's ability to learn discriminative image features for generalized nuclei classification. Extensive experiments conducted on several public datasets demonstrate that ULNC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization to unseen domains, highlighting its potential for robust nuclei classification across diverse datasets."

    "abstract": "Arbitrary-scale super-resolution (ASSR) overcomes the limitation of traditional super-resolution (SR) that works only at a fixed scale (e.g., ×4), enabling a single model to achieve arbitrary-scale SR. Most ASSR methods explicitly incorporate implicit neural representation (INR) to achieve ASSR, but INR’s inherently regression-driven feature extraction and aggregation nature restricts their capacity to synthesize meticulous details, leading to low realism. Recently, diffusion-based realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods leverage the pre-trained diffusion prior and have shown promising results at ×4 scale. We find that they could also achieve ASSR because the powerful pre-trained diffusion prior implicitly employs SR scale adaptation by encouraging the model to always generate high-realism images. However, due to the lack of explicit SR scale controls, the model fails to effectively manage the diffusion behavior according to different SR scales, causing either excessive hallucination or blurry results, especially for ultra-high magnification. To address these limitations, we propose <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">OmniScaleSR</i>, a novel diffusion-based realistic arbitrary-scale super-resolution (Real-ASSR) method to achieve both high fidelity and high-realism ASSR. We introduce explicit diffusion-native SR scale controls, which could be elegantly coupled with the implicit scale adaptation, unleashing scale-controlled diffusion prior to dynamically managing the diffusion behavior in a content- and scale-aware manner. Furthermore, we incorporate multi-domain fidelity enhancement designs to achieve more faithful reconstruction. Extensive experiments on both bicubic degradation benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that OmniScaleSR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both fidelity and perceptual realism, with especially strong performance under high-magnification scenarios.

However, bandwidth and latency constraints are significant challenges for CRAN deployment. To address these limitations, Cloud-Fog RAN (CF-RAN) has been proposed as an alternative solution. In this paper, we consider a cutting-edge CF-RAN scenario with different functional-split choices of virtualized BBUs with varying bandwidth and latency constraints. We propose an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to optimize functional split and allocate resources for optimal virtualized BBU placement, with the objective of minimizing power consumption. Our approach includes a novel queuing delay model based on the eCPRI standard. We also introduce a heuristic to address scalability issues. Dynamic simulations show that our method improves network availability by 35% and optimizes power consumption by 9.93%, outperforming prior studies. Our findings contribute to developing efficient CF-RAN systems and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Fashion recommendation is crucial for consumers to express their self-image and personal style. To boost recommendation accuracy and rationality, researchers have explored state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that incorporate items’ visual and textual information, along with their pairing records. However, these methods fail to fully explore how latent semantic-stylistic correlations between items influence recommendations, and inadequately tackle exposure bias, which results in skewed, restricted recommendations that prioritize popular or frequently observed outfits. To address these limitations, we propose DRFusionRec, a fashion recommender that enhances recommendation rationality and diversity by fully leveraging item semantic-stylistic correlations while mitigating exposure bias. Specifically, to harness rich item correlations, we introduce a novel Multi-Factor Relationship Measurement (MRM) matrix. It integrates semantic and stylistic features by mining the synergistic interaction probabilities across semantically and stylistically adjacent items, capturing the latent compatibility patterns. This matrix is then used to refine item features for richer details. To address homogeneity from exposure bias, we propose an Adaptive Propensity Score (APS) strategy. By dynamically weighting item popularity (direct influence) and popularity of style-similar neighbors (indirect contextual influence), we model exposure confounders to derive item propensity scores. Integrating these scores into item features effectively mitigates the bias. Lastly, MRM and APS synergistically optimize item representations for rationale-based and diverse recommendations. Experimental results validate that the DRFusionRec outperforms SOTA methods in capturing item compatibility, ensuring diverse recommendations, and maintaining reasonable complexity."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of sensor and information technology, multi-sensor data related to system degradation processes are now readily available for condition monitoring and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. However, this process is often complicated by the presence of censored sensor data. In this article, we propose a novel method called Bayesian LSTM-SURV, which integrates Survival Analysis (SA) with Neural Networks (NNs) to model the nonlinear relationship between degradation signals and RUL. This method addresses censored signals and the lack of RUL labels through a novel loss function. Additionally, we employ a Bayesian procedure to transfer information from the training data, enhancing the accuracy of predictions for the test data and maximizing the utilization of existing data. Instead of directly predicting RUL values, we assume that the lifetime follows a Weibull distribution. By modeling the lifetime distribution and survival function, we can calculate and predict RUL values while quantifying the uncertainty of these predictions. The advantageous features of the proposed method are demonstrated through simulation studies and its application to a high-fidelity gas turbine engine dataset."

Existing continual learning methods for large visual language models (LVLMs) often restrict the number of tasks they can handle, causing performance to decline as tasks continue to increase. In this paper, we propose a novel continual learning framework that adapts to the growing number of tasks, enabling visual language models to handle a dynamic range of open-set tasks while overcoming the catastrophic forgetting problem of learning new tasks at the expense of forgetting old ones.Our method builds on a pre-trained CLIP model and incorporates a dynamic mixture-of-experts (MoE) layer, enabling flexible adaptation to a wide range of open-set tasks. We design an elastic expert weight management strategy to effectively mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem. Furthermore, we optimize the LoRA experts with adaptive ranks to achieve a balanced trade-off between model complexity and representational capacity. Extensive experiments across diverse settings demonstrate that our proposed method significantly reduces the number of tunable parameters while consistently surpassing state-of-the-art methods in new task learning capability and maintaining performance on historical tasks."

    "abstract": "To address the Global Positioning System (GPS) generative spoofing attacks, this paper develops a dual-antenna attack detection system based on signal spatial correlation for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Since GPS signals exhibit spatial correlation, the angle of arrival varies with receiver position. Authentic satellite signals show stable angle-of-arrival patterns due to far-field propagation, while spoofed signals from nearby sources induce rapidly changing angles of arrival when the UAV moves. Based on this observation, the proposed system uses two spatially separated antennas to monitor real-time variation in signal arrival angles. A statistical hypothesis testing approach is adopted to distinguish between authentic and spoofed signals based on distribution detection, where the log-likelihood ratio test is used. A physical spoofing detection platform is implemented using a lightweight UAV, dual GPS receivers, and an embedded processor. In-flight experiments are conducted under realistic spoofing scenarios established with a software-defined radiobased attacker. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting spoofed signals and confirm the feasibility of deploying the system in real-time UAV applications."

During the process of CAVs accomplishing cooperative consensus, private information such as system matrix, state information, and control inputs needs to be transmitted over wireless networks, which are highly susceptible to interception by eavesdroppers. To mitigate this problem, a comprehensively private consensus control algorithm based on isomorphism transformation is proposed. Each CAV employs isomorphism transformation to map the actual system to a virtual isomorphism system. Subsequently, an event-triggered distributed adaptive control scheme is designed for the isomorphism system to prevent eavesdroppers from obtaining system dynamics while completing consensus among isomorphic CAVs. By utilizing the isometry property, the dynamic of isomorphism is equivalent to the dynamic of the actual system in terms of consensus. Meanwhile, the amount of privacy that the proposed algorithm can provide in four different scenarios of eavesdroppers with varying levels of knowledge is analyzed. Finally, simulation examples validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

    "abstract": "Accurate illumination is crucial for many imaging and vision applications, and skies are the dominant source of lighting in many scenes. Most existing work for representing sky illumination has focused on clear skies or more recently generative approaches for synthesizing clouds. However, these are very limited in that they assume distant illumination and do not capture the 3D properties of clouds. This paper presents a novel and principled approach to extract 3D whole-sky volumetric representations of clouds which can be used for imaging applications. Our approach extracts clouds from a single fisheye capture of the sky via an iterative optimization process. We achieve this by exploiting the physical properties of light scattering in clouds and use these to drive a domain-specific light transport simulation algorithm to render the images required for optimization. Results for this method provide high accuracy when re-rendering with our reconstructed clouds compared to real captures, and also enable novel uses of environment maps such as inclusion of captured clouds in renderings, cloud shadows, and more accurate aerial perspective and lighting."

    "abstract": "The widespread deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has driven their segmentation into distinct trust domains for the purpose of governance, creating a critical need for secure cross-domain authentication (CDA). CDA must preserve both anonymity and traceability of device identities to enable trustworthy data exchange. However, existing approaches, while exploring this trade-off, remain vulnerable to single points of failure and Sybil attacks—threats that are especially severe for unattended and resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we propose a Self-Sovereign and Supervised Cross-domain authentication scheme (SCross) to tackle these issues. The main building block we designed is a pseudonym management scheme (PMS) that allows devices to generate and use pseudonyms without relying on a trusted party. Although devices has full control of their identities, PMS still ensures traceability, Sybil resistance, and revocability. We define the formal security models of PMS, instantiate it under two different approaches, namely group signature (SCross-GS) and zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zkSNARKs, SCross-ZK), and present security proofs for our proposal. We implemented and evaluated SCross. The result shows that our scheme achieves an effective trade-off between security and efficiency."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a degradation model that characterizes the local magnetization properties of non-oriented electrical steel, which takes account of the effects of wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM) and stress relief annealing. The innovation of the presented model lies in its minimal requirement of the measured sample data and the capability of predicting the magnetization properties of narrow structures where degraded area overlaps. Specifically, only a single test sample along with original material data are needed to obtain the model coefficients for non-annealed steel sheets. Such a low demand for the measured source data is attributed to the accurate model setup combined with the residual stress, and the limited number of model coefficients. The presented model is fitted and applied to the test samples which are cut from three grades of steel sheets using the WEDM method, both with and without the annealing process. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and assess the manufacturing impact on real motors, two synchronous reluctance machines are fabricated with WEDM and annealing methods and measured. Compared to the calculated results using original material data, the static torque calculation error is reduced from 6.9% and 5.6% to 0.8% and 1.4% with the proposed material degradation model."

    "abstract": "Modeling deformable objects under external loads is of key importance for deformable object manipulation tasks. However, existing methods usually have high dimensionality, which makes them inefficient and challenging to incorporate external loads. In this article, a new physics-based method with reduced-state representation is proposed for modeling the dynamics of deformable objects under external loads. The finite element model is introduced to govern the dynamics of deformable objects, and a reduced-state space is constructed based on the pose of a set of handles extracted from mesh of the object, which allows the dynamics of deformable objects to be governed within low-dimensional state space. The external load imposed on deformable objects is simplified by incorporating new handles. Thus, a reduced-state space based on pose of both handles of deformable object and external loads, and their affine projection to deformation of the object is established. Simulation and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a high degree of accuracy and efficiency compared with the finite element method. Deformation of the object under external loads is accurately represented within the low-dimensional reduced-state space."

    "abstract": "The emergence of quantum computers heralds a new frontier in computational power, empowering quantum algorithms to address challenges that defy classical computation. However, the design of quantum algorithms is challenging as it largely requires the manual efforts of quantum experts to transit mathematical expressions to quantum circuit diagrams. To ease this process, particularly for prototyping, educational, and modular design workflows, we propose to bridge the textual and visual contexts between mathematics and quantum circuits through visual linking and transitions. We contribute a design space for quantum algorithm design, focusing on the textual and visual elements, interactions, and design patterns throughout the quantum algorithm design process. Informed by the design space, we introduce QuRAFT, a visual interface that facilitates a seamless transition from abstract mathematical expressions to concrete quantum circuits. QuRAFT incorporates a suite of eight integrated visual and interaction designs tailored to support users in the formulation, implementation, and validation process of the quantum algorithm design. Through two detailed case studies and a user evaluation, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness of QuRAFT. Feedback from quantum computing experts highlights the practical utility of QuRAFT in algorithm design and provides valuable implications for future advancements in visualization and interaction design within the quantum computing domain."

    "abstract": "Traditional covert communication often relies on the knowledge of the warden's channel state information, which is inherently challenging to obtain due to the non-cooperative nature and potential mobility of the warden. The integration of sensing and communication technology provides a promising solution by enabling the legitimate transmitter to sense and track the warden, thereby enhancing transmission covertness. In this paper, we develop a framework for sensing-then-beamforming in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered integrated sensing and covert communication (ISACC) systems, where the transmitter (Alice) estimates and tracks the mobile aerial warden's channel using sensing echo signals while simultaneously sending covert information to multiple legitimate users (Bobs) with the assistance of RIS, under the surveillance of the warden (Willie). Considering channel estimation errors, we formulate a robust non-convex optimization problem that jointly designs the communication beamformers, the sensing signal covariance matrix at Alice, and the phase shifts at the RIS to maximize the covert sum rate of Bobs while satisfying the constraints related to covert communication, sensing, transmitter power, and the unit modulus of the RIS elements. To solve this complex problem, we develop an efficient algorithm using alternating optimization, successive convex approximation, S-procedure, sequential rank-one constraint relaxation, and semidefinite relaxation techniques. Numerical results confirm the convergence of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness in tracking the warden's channel while ensuring robust covert transmission. Furthermore, the results highlight the advantages of using RIS to enhance the covert transmission rate compared to baseline schemes, and also illustrate the intricate trade-off between communication and sensing in ISACC systems."

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, knowledge resources have become central to advancing digital health, particularly in nutrition research. Nutrition is crucial for human growth, development, metabolism, and immunity, making it a key focus in public health and personalized medicine. Ontologies and knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as essential tools for addressing challenges in this field. This systematic review, conducted following the PRISMA guidelines, focuses primarily on the use of ontologies in human nutrition, including their applications, development methodologies, construction resources, evaluation criteria, and associated challenges. KGs are considered in a secondary role to support the preliminary analysis and provide insights into related applications. The review covers studies published between 2014 and 2024. A comprehensive search across Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library identified 58 studies, including 45 utilizing ontologies and 13 employing KGs. Findings reveal a growing use of these tools to develop personalized recipes, nutrient intake recommendations, food suggestions, dietary plans, and recommender systems. However, significant gaps persist in the standardization of methodologies, resource integration, and evaluation criteria, limiting interoperability and scalability for personalized applications. Ontology-based systems dominate knowledge representation, while KGs are being explored for personalization in diet planning and data integration. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to exclusively focus on the intersection of ontologies with a preliminary analysis of KGs in human nutrition. By bridging computational techniques with nutritional science, this review establishes the foundation for innovative applications in digital health and personalized nutrition, contributing to improved public health outcomes."

    "abstract": "This paper jointly investigates privacy preservation and Byzantine-robustness in decentralized learning. In a decentralized network, honest-but-curious agents faithfully follow the prescribed algorithm, but expect to infer their neighbors' private data from messages received during the learning process, while dishonest-and-Byzantine agents disobey the prescribed algorithm, and deliberately disseminate wrong messages to their neighbors for the sake of biasing the learning process. For this novel setting, we investigate a generic privacy-preserving and Byzantine-robust decentralized stochastic gradient descent (SGD) framework, in which Gaussian noise is injected to preserve privacy and robust aggregation rules are adopted to counteract Byzantine attacks. We analyze its learning error and privacy guarantee, discovering an essential tradeoff between privacy preservation and Byzantine-robustness in decentralized learning – the learning error caused by defending against Byzantine attacks is exacerbated by the Gaussian noise added to preserve privacy. For a class of state-of-the-art robust aggregation rules, we give unified analysis of their “mixing abilities”. Building upon this analysis, we reveal how the “mixing abilities” affect the tradeoff between privacy preservation and Byzantine-robustness. The theoretical results provide guidelines for achieving a favorable tradeoff with proper design of robust aggregation rules. Numerical experiments are conducted and corroborate our theoretical findings."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the rise of advanced machine learning techniques has led to an increase in research on brain-computer interfaces. It’s considered a multifaceted challenge to develop applications that can analyze EEG signals into domains such as mental health assessment, real-time emotional monitoring, and personalized wellness recommendations. In this investigation, it will display the effectiveness of a hybrid deep learning neural network architecture that integrates Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRU) and Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) layers for the classification of multiple emotions based on EEG data. The publicly available EEG Brainwave Dataset: Feeling Good, provided by the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Aston University, Birmingham, was used in this study. The central hypothesis we propose combines the BiGRU and BiLSTM layers, enhancing the model’s capacity to capture temporal dependencies and manage the complex sequential patterns inherent in EEG signals. To evaluate this hypothesis, three distinct model architectures were assessed: BiGRU-only model, BiLSTM-only model, and combined BiGRU + BiLSTM model. These models were then trained and tested on a labeled dataset of EEG recording. The results demonstrated that the hybrid BiGRU + BiLSTM model achieved the highest classification accuracy, reaching approximately 98.59%, compared to 98.13% for the BiGRU model and 98.1% for the BiLSTM model. This result suggests potential future applications in assistive technologies, where individuals with severe motor impairments—such as those with ALS or spinal cord injuries—could benefit from EEG-based emotion detection systems to support non-verbal communication and adaptive interaction. Further analysis of precision, recall, and F1 scores in the three emotion classes provided deeper insights into the sensitivity and specificity of the model. This underscores its potential for implementation in real-time affective computing applications in future works."

    "abstract": "In this article, the evolution of social power is studied within a unified framework comprising two classes of individuals: oblivious individuals and stubborn individuals, whose opinion dynamics are described by the DeGroot averaging model and the Friedkin–Johnsen model, respectively. A proper subset of the simplex is identified to ensure the well-posedness of social power, and it is demonstrated that the corresponding opinion dynamics is convergent for each issue by restricting the initial social power to this proper subset. Through the reflected appraisal mechanism, a nonlinear mapping governing the social power evolution together with its invariant set is derived, and some sufficient conditions with linear time complexity for the convergence of social power are established by proving that this nonlinear mapping is contractive on the invariant set. Furthermore, for the final social power, it is found that both autocratic and democratic social power cannot be achieved during the evolution, and the average social power of oblivious individuals is larger than that of stubborn individuals, indicating that the network topology has a greater impact on social power than individual stubbornness. In addition, it is observed that the final social power ranking of oblivious individuals is consistent with their centrality ranking, and a rigorous lower bound on the final social power is derived for each stubborn individual. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the correctness of the theoretical analysis."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces low-complexity frequency-dependent (memory) linearizers designed to suppress nonlinear distortion in analog-to-digital interfaces. Two different linearizers are considered, based on nonlinearity models which correspond to sampling before and after the nonlinearity operations, respectively. The proposed linearizers are inspired by convolutional neural networks but have an order-of-magnitude lower implementation complexity compared to existing neural-network-based linearizer schemes. The proposed linearizers can also outperform the traditional parallel Hammerstein linearizers even when the nonlinearities have been generated through a Hammerstein model. Further, a design procedure is proposed in which the linearizer parameters are obtained through matrix inversion. This eliminates the need for costly and time-consuming iterative nonconvex optimization that is traditionally associated with neural network training. The design effectively handles a wide range of wideband multi-tone signals and filtered white noise. Examples demonstrate significant signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) improvements of about 20–30 dB, as well as a lower implementation complexity than the Hammerstein linearizers."

Yet, most solutions rely on body-worn devices or invasive helmet modifications, limiting adoption in industrial settings. We propose a non-invasive smart helmet with embedded motion and environmental sensors, fully integrated into a certification-compliant shell. To explore its applicability in realistic industrial conditions, we focused on constrained acquisition scenarios—characterized by low sampling rates, limited storage, and processing capacity. A multimodal dataset was collected using embedded tri-axial accelerometers and barometric pressure sensors during operational tasks. Four classification pipelines were evaluated: Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), a wavelet-based RF (using Horizontal Concatenation of Continuous Wavelet Transforms, HC-CWT), and a deep learning pipeline combining a Convolutional Autoencoder with LSTM (ConvAE-LSTM). Among these, XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy (up to 87.4%) and the most favorable balance between latency and computational efficiency, particularly with 8–15 s windows. This best-performing model was then deployed on the resource-constrained helmet system, confirming its suitability for on-board HAR in scalable occupational safety applications."

    "abstract": "The convergence of federated learning (FL) and blockchain in edge-end-cloud systems offers promising opportunities for privacy-preserving collaborative intelligence. However, existing blockchain-enhanced FL (BFL) approaches remain vulnerable to malicious participants and lack robust protection for model updates. To address these issues, we propose SEPP-FLBC, a Secure and Efficient Privacy Protection framework based on Federated Learning and Blockchain Committees. SEPP-FLBC introduces a novel blockchain committee consensus mechanism to validate model updates and defend against unreliable nodes. It further employs a refined multi-party communication paradigm to facilitate indirect and secure data interactions, reducing the risk of information leakage. Additionally, differential privacy noise is applied to model updates to enhance resistance to inference attacks. A formal convergence analysis is conducted to ensure model stability and minimize overhead. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEPP-FLBC achieves superior accuracy while maintaining strong privacy guarantees and communication efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art BFL methods in both security and performance."

    "abstract": "Robots made from soft and compliant materials offer a promising alternative to traditional rigid robots, particularly in human–robot collaborative environments due to their inherent safety. Pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) play a critical role in this field, serving as compliant actuators capable of generating substantial forces. However, this type of actuator still faces challenges in generating bidirectional force over a large range of motion. In this article, we introduce a three-dimensional (3-D)-printed PAM with a telescopic structure using a nested structure. The actuator's large volumetric deformation enables it to generate high bidirectional forces using positive and negative pressures, while also providing a wide range of motion with significant extension and contraction ratios. The use of 3-D printing not only simplifies the design and fabrication process but also offers significant advantages in mass production and industrial implementation. The proposed actuator can generate an extension blocked force of 659 N with an extension ratio of 447.1% and contract with payloads up to 7 kg up to a contraction ratio of 76.9%. A rotational configuration of the actuator is also presented with a blocked torque of 18.5 Nm. These actuators were then implemented into grippers and extendable links for robotic manipulators."

In this study, we develop an innovative approach for determining soil PTT in the region of the dense soil moisture and soil temperature monitoring network in the Qinghai Lake Basin (QLB-NET). We employ four advanced models—polynomial regression (PR), random forest (RF), feedforward neural network (FNN), and transformer (XFMR) models—to establish relationships between soil PTT and various environmental factors for daily and site-specific soil PTT estimation. Soil PTT values derived from a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">sigmoid</i> curve fitting (SCF) method that combines physical theory with empirical modeling are used in the models as the target data considering soil properties and topographic features as predictors. Additionally, we systematically evaluate the models’ performance and compare the results against those of the fixed 0°C threshold methods. The results indicate that most soil freezing temperatures range between -1°C and 0°C, and thawing temperatures range between -0.5°C and 0.5°C, with occasional freezing temperatures above 0°C. Model-derived soil PTT significantly outperforms the traditional 0°C threshold in terms of soil FT state classification accuracy, particularly during the frozen and FT transitional seasons. The XFMR model achieves superior performance in an internal comparative analysis, highlighting its particular effectiveness for soil PTT determination. These results provide valuable insights for improving remote sensing-based FT product validation and permafrost monitoring."

By combining feed-forward and feedback control, the sensori motor system is able to predictively scale grip and manipulation forces and quickly adapt to environmental changes. Using technologies such as virtual reality, researchers can investigate the underlying mechanisms in ways that are not possible in the physical world. Here, we present our custom-built virtual reality setup, including an open-source software framework, and show its validity in human motor control studies. We replicated two well-established experiments involving physical objects that investigated how humans adapt to different object mass and center of mass. Our results show that the general force and position control strategies employed in the virtual experiment closely mirrored those observed in the real world. Specifically, participants scaled grip forces with object mass and coordinated digit positions and forces according to the object's center of mass and shape. However, the trial-by-trial adaptation rate was slower, and the grip forces were slightly increased in the virtual setup, likely due to increased uncertainty arising from the 2D visual feedback and the lack of cutaneous feedback. Additionally, we tested the effect of visual feedback complexity by comparing a simple and detailed representation of the fingers, finding that participants exhibited similar manipulation strategies across both conditions. Our results validate this setup as a reliable platform for future studies in human motor control."

Inter-user interference (IUI) suppression performance in the MU-MIMO system deteriorates due to the mismatch between the channel state used for precoding weight derivation and that during signal transmission. Leveraging the massive antenna degrees of freedom (DOFs) in mMIMO, null-space expansion (NSE) was previously conceived to improve IUI suppression performance by steering multiple nulls toward undesired user equipments (UEs), even in high-mobility environment. However, NSE has severe challenges, such as high computation complexity caused by the increasing nullification and near singular matrix structure of the Gram matrix due to high time correlation. Considering these challenges, this paper proposes Jacobi matrix-based iterative low-complexity NSE weight design. Focusing on the Gram matrix’s block diagonal structure in NSE, this paper presents a Jakes’ model-based approximation and Ridge parameter optimization using deep unfolding (DU) to enhance the convergence of the inverse matrix. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through computer simulations."

    "abstract": "Active noise control (ANC) is an effective method for suppressing unwanted noise. While most commercial ANC products rely on pre-trained fixed-filters for noise attenuation due to their high computational efficiency and stability, the noise reduction (NR) performance is prone to variations in the direction of incident noise and noise spectral content mismatch. In this paper, a selective fixed-filter ANC algorithm based on parallel structure and Bayesian tracking (SFANC-PSBT) is proposed to mitigate these problems. Bayesian tracking is applied to deal with the noise source direction uncertainties and to select the grid-based fixed filter with the largest posterior probability. Moreover, the parallel broadband fixed-filter adaptive gain (PBFAG) approach is proposed to improve NR performance for off-grid directions, and the parallel narrowband fixed-filter adaptive gain (PNFAG) approach is proposed to further attenuate noise and to mitigate the noise spectral content mismatch issue. Besides, stochastic analysis of the proposed methods is provided. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve better NR performance, faster convergence rate and higher robustness against noise variations under changing primary path conditions. The PNFAG and PBFAG methods yield NR improvements of 23.71% and 18.67%, respectively, over the conventional fixed-filter method. Some before/after ANC sound samples under different noise conditions can be found in https://zhchengcq.github.io/ANCdemo/."

Traditional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods have limitations in high-temperature environments. This paper addresses the temperature drift issue of conventional eddy current sensors by proposing a single-excitation dual-detection symmetric U-shaped differential probe. This design suppresses temperature drift through magnetic field balancing and differential signal processing. Based on multi-physics coupling theory, a simulation model is developed to reveal the nonlinear attenuation behavior of electrical conductivity of the relevant materials in the temperature range of 20~200°C, and the correlation between defect depth and signal temperature drift. The environmental adaptability of the differential probe is confirmed to be superior. A high-temperature eddy current detection system is developed, and a platform is built for testing. Defect detection in the range of 0.3 to 1.2 mm at 20~200 °C shows that both the real and imaginary parts of the defect signal exhibit nonlinear attenuation, with deeper defects being more sensitive to temperature changes. High-temperature tests confirm that the newly developed probe effectively suppresses temperature drift in the range of 20~200 °C and performs better than traditional probes."

In this paper, we propose an angiographic framework based on a conditional multi-view diffusion model called AEGIS with three innovations: multi-view hybrid learning (MHL), conditional angiographic diffusion estimation (CADE), and multi-view map fusion (MMF). 1) MHL targets Contrast Map (CM), the difference between NCCT and CT angiography, from multiple views to perceive 3D features in 2D space, enhancing the stability of feature representation. 2) CADE is a conditional diffusion model using NCCT as spatial guidance, providing crucial information for CM generation. 3) MMF adopts a lightweight AutoEncoder for filtering and fusing multi-view CMs, maintaining coherence between adjacent slices while modifying slight bias in low-dimensional representations, thus optimizing data quality and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate our superior performance, which achieve state-of-the-art image quality (PSNR+6.69, SSIM+3.17, MSE-46.38), segmentation evaluation (CADIR×10.49, HSDIR×5.57) and feature distance (FID-64.27).

The thermal design show that, despite a sufficient current margin provided at the electromagnetic design stage, the localized temperature rise induced by the hysteresis loss degrades the critical current, making the magnet unstable.

    "abstract": "Triangular current mode (TCM) control is popularly applied in low-to-medium power grid-tied inverters (GTIs) due to its excellent ability of realizing full-range zero-voltage-switching (FR-ZVS). However, practical circuit nonidealities, including time delay and the resonance occurring between the power inductor and parasitic output capacitances (POCs) of the power switches, make actual inductor current boundary diverge from the required one, which degrades the control accuracy and thereby deteriorates the grid current total harmonic distortion (THD). To tackle this issue, an improved inductor current compensation scheme for TCM controlled GTIs is proposed. Taking the single-phase full-bridge (FB) GTI as an example, the adverse effects of time delay and resonance process on TCM control are separately modeled and analyzed. Then, an accurate operation model of TCM controlled GTIs considering these two circuit nonidealities is developed. In this model, a charge-based resonance behaviors estimator is proposed for estimating the pivotal current and time parameters of the resonance process with simple forms. Further, elaborations of the proposed scheme, parameters design and control implementation are conducted. Finally, the efficacy and advantages of the proposed scheme are verified through the simulations and experiments on a 300-W GTI prototype."

As use-case diversity grows exponentially and user adoption drives traffic to unprecedented and highly dynamic levels, novel service orchestration mechanisms are indispensable. In this paper, we adopt an architectural viewpoint, examining Service Registration, Indexing, Discovery, and Selection (SRIDS) as fundamental elements of 6G service provision. We first establish the theoretical foundations of SRIDS in 6G by defining its core concepts, detailing its end-to-end workflow, reviewing current standardization efforts, and projecting its future design objectives, including reliability, scalability, automaticity and adaptability, determinism, efficiency, sustainability, semantic-awareness, security, privacy, and trust. We then perform a comprehensive literature review and gap analysis encompassing both existing surveys and recent research efforts, identifying conceptual and methodological gaps that hinder unified SRIDS in 6G. Next, we introduce a taxonomy that classifies SRIDS mechanisms into centralized, distributed, decentralized, and hybrid architectures, and systematically examine the relevant studies within each category. Each work is evaluated against the extracted design objectives. Building on these findings, we propose a hybrid architectural framework, combining centralized data management to ensure consistency and agility with distributed coordination to enhance scalability in emerging 6G use cases. The framework incorporates innovative technologies, such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). We conclude by highlighting open challenges and suggesting directions for future research."

Recent advancements in deep learning and computer vision have significantly improved the precision and efficiency of SDR. However, the scarcity of defect samples presents a challenge for training deep learning models, making few-shot learning necessary for the SDR task. For this, this paper explores innovative contributions of Large Generative Models (LGM) to few-shot SDR by integrating Large Language Models (LLM) and Multimodal Generative Models (MGM). We present an LGM-based Training-Free Data Augmentation (LTDA) method to efficiently expand few-shot datasets without additional training. LTDA employs a conditional generation framework that leverages text instructions provided by LLM as conditions to guide the generation process of MGM. Additionally, multiple prompting templates have been designed for LLM to provide more precise instructions, thereby better guiding the conditional generation process. Finally, we employ two strategies for utilizing generated data to accomplish enhanced few-shot SDR by LTDA. The effectiveness of these approaches is demonstrated through two cases of defect recognition on steel surfaces, where the results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 29% and 13% over the baseline method.

    "abstract": "Conforming to safety standards often limits collaborative robots' performance and size, restricting their applications despite their capabilities. Planning their motions in human environments involves a trade-off between optimal trajectory planning and quick adaptation to dynamic, unstructured spaces. Traditional trajectory planning methods either use simplified robot models and sacrifice robot's abilities for computational efficiency, or exploit robots' abilities fully but have high computational complexity and rely on substantial pre-computation. This paper introduces an approach for trajectory planning that exploits robot's full motion abilities while planning on-the-fly. In each step of the trajectory execution, it evaluates robot's movement ability using polytope algebra and calculates a time-optimal Trapezoidal Acceleration Profile (TAP) on the remaining trajectory. The method is shown to be near time-optimal (around 5% slower trajectories) by benchmarking it against the state-of-the-art time-optimal method TOPP-RA. The method allows reaching higher velocities (able to plan up to 100% of the robot's kinematic limits) while at the same time lowering the tracking error (under 4mm) than traditional Cartesian Space planning methods. A mock-up experiment demonstrates its efficiency in collaborative waste sorting using a Franka Emika Panda robot."

By employing various computational techniques, our method supports both in-situ and initial calibration scenarios, offering flexibility for diverse radar systems, including those with non-planar or independently deployed antennas.

    "abstract": "We develop the theoretical formulation for a non-intrusive, quadrature-based method for approximate balanced truncation (QuadBT) of linear systems with quadratic outputs, thus extending the applicability of QuadBT, which was originally designed for data-driven balanced truncation of standard linear systems with linear outputs only. The new approach makes use of the time-domain and frequency-domain quadrature-based representation of the system’s infinite Gramians, only implicitly. We show that by sampling solely the extended impulse responses (kernels) of the original system and their derivatives (or the corresponding transfer functions), we construct a reduced-order model that mimics the approximation quality of the intrusive (projection-based) balanced truncation. Although the sampling of the required kernels via input/output simulations or physical experiments is still an open question, we demonstrate a proof of concept for the proposed framework on an example using numerically evaluated data."

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of generative AI models is leading to more realistic deepfake media, encompassing the manipulation of audio, video, or both. This raises severe privacy and societal concerns. Numerous studies in this area have yielded promising intra-domain results; however, these models frequently exhibit decreased efficacy when faced with data from dissimilar domains. Consequently, recent deepfake detection approaches focus on enhancing the generalization ability through multiple techniques that incorporate all input modalities, including audio, images, and their interactions. In this regard, we propose the EAV-DFD method, a generalized deep ensemble audiovisual model (EAV-DFD) combined with a domain adaptation mechanism utilizing a teacher-student framework to enhance the model’s ability to perform and generalize effectively across unseen domains. To evaluate the model’s performance, we used the FakeAVCeleb dataset as the primary domain and the DFDC, Deepfake_TIMIT, and PolyGlotFake datasets as an unseen domain. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework is efficient in domain adaptation, improving AUC performance of the model by 4.09%, 17.94%, and 0.5% on three unseen datasets, using only a small portion of them to train the student model. This leads to a novel deepfake detection model capable of adapting to new domains and interpreting which modality has been manipulated, highlighting the potential of our approach for real-world applications."

    "abstract": "Differential privacy (DP) is a leading paradigm for privacy preservation in statistical analysis and learning. Traditional DP mechanisms add noise independently of the original data, which yields inconsistent perturbations across groups and raises fairness concerns in downstream decision and learning tasks. Prior work often assesses fairness via bias and variance, while overlooking noise direction and the scale of the underlying query. We propose a novel Fairly Proportional Noise Mechanism (FPNM) that uniquely considers both the direction and magnitude of noise relative to raw query results. We define mathematical formulations for unfairness, factoring in weighting and temporal decay to allow nonlinear amplification of unfairness. The privacy analysis shows a negative correlation between unfairness and privacy strength that higher privacy levels lead to increased noise and thus greater unfairness. We then generalize to group-level assessment using the average unfairness and the Frobenius norm (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$F$</tex-math></inline-formula>-Norm). We also prove that adaptive budget reallocation within a data independent feasible domain preserves the overall <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$(\\epsilon ,\\delta )$</tex-math></inline-formula>-DP guarantee. Experiments on both decision and learning tasks demonstrate consistent gains. In decision tasks, the proposed FPNM effectively reduces unfairness, achieving average reductions of 19.17% and 17.32% in <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$F$</tex-math></inline-formula>-Norm and average unfairness, respectively. In learning tasks, integrating FPNM with DP-SGD achieves fairness comparable to fairness-aware baselines and better accuracy. Besides, empirical privacy remains intact under membership inference attacks. These results highlight its effectiveness in improving utility while preserving privacy, offering a robust and comprehensive approach to enhancing fairness in DP."

    "abstract": "The aspiration to replicate the capabilities of the human hand has driven innovations in the design of soft robotic hands. Despite these advancements, many existing designs of soft hands still lack effective in-hand vision and the ability for each finger to achieve active multi-degree-of-freedom motion. This paper proposes a cable-driven soft robotic hand that can achieve dexterous grasping and manipulation, vision-guided grasping, vision-based slip detection and compensation, as well as visually servoed in-hand manipulation. The hand has five soft fingers, each capable of independent flexion/extension motion and bidirectional ad/abduction motion. A red-green-blue-depth (RGB-D) camera is integrated into the palm of the soft hand to enable in-hand vision capability. Modeling of the soft hand is established to analyze its kinematics, statics, and manipulability. A series of experiments are conducted to demonstrate its dexterous grasping and manipulation capabilities on a variety of objects. Using 3D point cloud data from the in-palm camera, an effective vision-guided grasping strategy is developed to grasp objects on a table. The in-hand vision also enables slip detection and compensation during grasping to maintain the grasp stability. Furthermore, a hierarchical, visually servoed controller is developed to perform closed-loop in-hand object manipulation. With its high dexterity and visual feedback capabilities, the soft hand will find important applications such as household object manipulation and food picking/sorting, and may also be used as a prosthetic hand or an auxiliary hand for humans."

    "abstract": "High-temperature thin-film strain gauges (TFSGs) face challenges in balancing high strain sensitivity (Gauge Factor, GF), low temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR), and long-term stability. This study presents a novel bilayer FeCrAl/PdCr composite TFSG designed to overcome these limitations through strategic material combination and thickness ratio optimization. Comprehensive characterization revealed that the thickness ratio critically governs microstructure and electrical properties of the composite thin-film. Electrical testing demonstrated that the 1:1 ratio achieved the lowest resistivity, attributed to minimized combined grain boundary and interface scattering. Crucially, it also yielded the most stable TCR and lowest resistance drift rate, resulting from effective self-compensation between FeCrAl’s higher positive TCR and PdCr’s superior stability/oxidation resistance. Multilayer TFSGs employing the optimized 1:1 FeCrAl/PdCr composite as the strain-sensitive element were also fabricated on DD6 nickel-based superalloy substrates and turbine blades. Static strain tests demonstrated excellent linearity and significantly enhanced GF. This represents a 30–50% improvement over PdCr gauges. The GF decrease with temperature correlated primarily with the reduction in the substrate’s elastic modulus. High repeatability was confirmed over three cycles. Dynamic strain response tests on turbine blades showed the TFSG reliably captured resonant frequencies. The FeCrAl/PdCr (1:1) composite TFSG successfully mitigates the traditional trade-off between high sensitivity and temperature stability, and reliable static/dynamic response. This demonstrates its strong potential for accurate strain monitoring in high-temperature aerospace applications, particularly turbine blade health monitoring."

Cascode GaN high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) were exposed to gamma radiation doses of up to 10 Mrad.approximately 10 times higher than the average reported in the literature.resulting in significant degradation of their output and transfer characteristics. Our non-thermal annealing process appreciably mitigated radiation-induced damage within minutes.

    "abstract": "This article addresses the output feedback tracking control problem for underactuated vessels with full nonlinearities using a novel oscillator approach. The oscillator generates a persistent time-varying signal to overcome the systems inherent underactuation. Meanwhile, adaptive high-gain observers handle the nonlinearities caused by unknown hydrodynamics and unmeasured velocities. To ensure robust stability, a saturated controller is integrated to prevent the “peaking phenomenon” associated with the observers. The resulting output feedback controller is proven to guarantee bounded signals and arbitrarily small tracking errors, validating the high-performance design. This implies that the steady-state tracking errors can be made arbitrarily small. Simulations also demonstrate the effectiveness of the controllers."

    "abstract": "The dynamics of glaciers and ice shelf fronts significantly impact the mass balance of ice sheets and coastal sea levels. To effectively monitor glacier conditions, it is crucial to consistently estimate positional shifts of glacier calving fronts. However, laborious manual mapping calving fronts in satellite observations requires a considerable expense. The Attention-Multi-hooking-Deep-supervision HookNet (AMD-HookNet) firstly introduces a pure two-branch convolutional neural network (CNN) for glacier segmentation. Yet, the local nature and translational invariance of convolution operations, while beneficial for capturing low-level details, restricts the model ability to maintain long-range dependencies. In this study, we propose AMD-HookNet++, a novel advanced hybrid CNN-Transformer feature enhancement method for segmenting glaciers and delineating calving fronts in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Our hybrid structure consists of two branches: a Transformer-based low-resolution (context) branch to capture long-range dependencies, which provides global contextual information in a larger view, and a CNN-based high-resolution (target) branch to preserve local details. To strengthen the representation of the connected hybrid features, we devise an enhanced spatial-channel attention (ESCA) module to foster interactions between the hybrid CNN-Transformer branches through dynamically adjusting the token relationships from both spatial and channel perspectives. Additionally, we develop a pixel-to-pixel contrastive deep supervision for optimizing our hybrid model. It integrates pixel-wise metric learning into glacier segmentation by guiding hierarchical pyramid-based pixel embeddings with category-discriminative capability. Through extensive experiments and comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses on the challenging glacier segmentation benchmark dataset CaFFe, we demonstrate that AMD-HookNet++ sets a new state of the art with an intersection over union (IoU) of 78.2 and a 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95) of 1,318 m, while maintaining a competitive mean distance error (MDE) of 367 m. More importantly, our hybrid model produces smoother delineations of calving fronts, resolving the issue of jagged edges typically seen in pure Transformer-based approaches."

This article introduces a novel magnetic coupler that combines a transmitter coil with an intermediate coil to simultaneously generate both E-type and C-type flux patterns, enabling efficient coupling with both unipolar and bipolar receiver coils. When paired with an S–S–S compensation topology providing load-independent voltage output, the proposed three-coil system achieves seamless magnetic interoperability without control mechanisms or feedback communication. Experimental results verify the system’s effectiveness, achieving peak efficiencies of 95.4% with unipolar receivers and 91.4% with bipolar receivers across a 12-cm air gap while maintaining efficiency above 88.8% and output voltage variations below 10 V throughout the charging cycle. The proposed magnetic coupler can tolerate a misalignment of around 20% of the transmitter size while still maintaining an efficiency over 89% for both receiver coils."

Leveraging this result, we introduce a constructive approach for the numerical computation of the Lyapunov matrix corresponding to scalar LIDEs with commensurate delays. Specifically, the Lyapunov matrix equations are reformulated as the Fredholm integral equation under consideration, for which the proposed conditions are satisfied under exponential stability of the LIDE. The resulting integral equation can then be discretized, and the linear system solved to efficiently compute the Delay Lyapunov matrix. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of this methodology."

    "abstract": "Dynamic task allocation in multi-UAV systems, where pickup-and-delivery tasks arrive randomly with time windows, is challenging due to two main factors: (1) strict temporal and spatial constraints, and (2) reduced allocation optimality caused by unforeseen tasks. This paper proposes a distributed auction algorithm based on potential rewards to maximize total system profit. The algorithm operates in two phases. In the first phase, each UAV independently generates feasible task groups according to temporal and spatial constraints and evaluates candidate tasks by considering selection flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and discounted future value. In the second phase, UAVs engage in a distributed auction, exchanging bids with neighbors to reach consensus and achieve conflict-free assignments. To further enhance flexibility, a task transfer protocol is introduced, allowing idle UAVs to take over assigned but unpicked-up tasks if the tasks can be completed ahead of schedule, thereby freeing the originally assigned UAVs to pursue more profitable opportunities. Simulation results on 30 benchmark instances adapted from the Solomon dataset show that the proposed method outperforms three state-of-the-art online baselines-Consensus-Based Bundle Algorithm (CBBA), CBBA with Partial Replanning (CBBA-PR), and Distributed Group-Based Auction Algorithm (DGAA). Moreover, it achieves near-optimal performance in balanced scenarios and competitive results in high-density cases when compared with the offline solver OR-Tools."

We propose a dual-IMU waistband design and train a network to estimate RR from the sensor signals. In a 20-participant study spanning sitting, standing, walking, and running, our method consistently outperforms prior IMU-based approaches, particularly during dynamic motion. The results demonstrate that the network effectively separates respiratory signals from motion interference, providing accurate and reliable RR estimation with a minimal, wearable-friendly sensor configuration."

    "abstract": "Most existing domain generalization methods for fault diagnosis focus on extracting domain-invariant features from multiple source domains. However, the lack of target data severely restricts these domain-invariant features to only the source domain distribution, leading to inadequate generalization performance under unseen working conditions. To address this critical limitation, we propose a novel method named domain information removal with decision region enlargement. Specifically, for domain information elimination, we design dual encoders and dual classifiers to separately extract and classify fault-related features and domain-related features. A distribution discriminator is then introduced to minimize the mutual information between fault-features and domain-features, thereby yielding purer fault-discriminative representations. To further enhance the discriminability of fault features, learnable comparative anchors are employed to strengthen intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. This process clarifies the decision region for each fault category, enabling more robust adaptation to accurate identification of diverse faults in the target domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new radio direction finding technique based on irregular non-rectilinear arrays, which operates without priori knowledge of source radiation frequencies. Spatial Fourier transform (SFT), as formulated in this work, is applied to signals received by irregular, non-rectilinear arrays to find source directions. The technique accounts for motion and synthesizes virtual arrays affected by Doppler shifts. Doppler correction is crucial and SFT is generalized accordingly to accommodate motion-induced frequency shifts. Finally, the developed technique is experimentally validated. The technique exhibits reasonable accuracy and resolution for direction of arrival (DoA) finding of multiple coherent and non-coherent AM/CW sources. Another remarkable advantage of the technique is the ability to effectively find source directions even under sparse and down-sampled conditions, i.e., receiver spacing larger than Nyquist half-wavelength. This advantage, in addition to facilitating practical implementation, makes higher frequency sources or jammers visible."

    "abstract": "As a post-quantum digital signature scheme, Dilithium was specifically designed to withstand known quantum algorithm attacks, and its side-channel resistance has garnered significant research attention. However, current side-channel attacks against Dilithium exhibit several limitations: (1) failure to leverage low-correlation characteristics in power traces, (2) loss functions limited to categorical information extraction from power traces, (3) dependency on specific coefficient recovery conditions while neglecting inter-coefficient statistical dependencies, (4) requirement for separate profiling models per intermediate value, resulting in substantial information loss. To address these limitations, we propose an enhanced template attack framework integrating deep learning with classical template attack methodology. Our approach employs a dual-loss similarity learning mechanism for feature extraction from high-dimensional power traces, enabling the construction of more discriminative templates while preserving weakly correlated features. Through assembly-level analysis of the y polynomial generation routine, we reveal inherent correlations among coefficients <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">y</i><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>k</i></sup><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">y</i><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>k</i></sup><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">y</i><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>k</i></sup><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">y</i><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>k</i></sup><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>. Building on this discovery, our dual-loss similarity learning framework is designed to capture these inter-coefficient relationships, preserving their intrinsic dependencies while achieving effective inter-class separation and intra-class aggregation properties, which significantly enhances the effectiveness of subsequent template attacks. Experimental results on Cortex-M4 power traces demonstrate our method achieves 32.94% polynomial coefficient recovery accuracy for polynomial coefficients y, outperforming conventional SOD-based (83% improvement), T-Test-based (97%), and PCA-based template attacks (197% enhancement). Furthermore, complete private key recovery is achieved with merely 14 power traces under specific conditions. This DL-enhanced template attack framework demonstrates superior side-channel leakage exploitation, yielding substantial performance enhancements over conventional approaches."

    "abstract": "The accuracy of change detection (CD) in high-resolution remote sensing imagery can be compromised due to complex surface textures, variations in illumination, and atmospheric disturbances. Existing methods struggle to simultaneously achieve noise suppression, long-range dependency modeling, and computational efficiency. In response to the above challenges, this study proposes a Spatial-Frequency Collaborative Detection Network (SFCNet) that combines VMamba's linear-complexity global modeling with frequency-domain techniques. The designed network adopts a VMamba-based encoder to efficiently extract multi-scale features, and further integrates a Frequency-Spatial Interaction Module (FSIM) to perform content-aware noise suppression and detail enhancement through spatial-domain-guided adaptive frequency filtering. A progressive decoder, equipped with a Hybrid Pooling Channel Attention Module (HPCAM), integrates multi-level features through hybrid pooling and progressive fusion strategies. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed SFCNet, extensive experiments were conducted on three widely-used public datasets: LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and CLCD. The network achieved F1-scores of 91.17%, 94.29%, and 74.98%, along with Intersection over Union values of 83.78%, 89.21%, and 59.98%, respectively. These results clearly demonstrate that the proposed method enhances detection accuracy and robustness under complex scenarios."

    "abstract": "Extreme hazard events such as wildfires and hurricanes increasingly threaten power systems, causing widespread outages and disrupting critical services. To mitigate these risks, grid operators must act proactively—pre-positioning crews and resources or scheduling hardening activities—guided by forecasts that directly support operational objectives. Traditionally, utilities and agencies have followed a predict-then-optimize paradigm: first generating impact forecasts, then using them to inform response planning. However, this two-step approach inherently separates forecasting from decision-making, overlooking how forecast errors propagate into downstream actions and often producing misaligned or suboptimal plans. We address this gap with predict-all-then-optimize-globally (PATOG), a framework that unifies outage prediction with globally optimized interventions. At its core, our global-decision-focused (GDF) Neural ODE model jointly captures outage dynamics and optimizes pre-event resilience strategies in a decision-aware manner. Unlike conventional methods, our approach ensures spatially and temporally coherent decisions, enhancing both predictive accuracy and operational efficiency. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world data show that GDF reduces decision regret by up to 75% compared to two-stage baselines, enabling more effective proactive planning."

    "abstract": "Estimating the extents of E/MEG source activities is crucial for exploring brain dynamics at high spatiotemporal resolution. In this study, we introduce a novel ESI method – Block-Champagne, a Bayesian framework designed to accurately estimate both the locations and extents of extended sources. Our approach leverages a block-sparsity constraint that models each voxel and its neighbors as a single block to account for local homogeneity. The blocks, inherently overlapping in the original source domain, can be adaptively combined to reconstruct sources with arbitrary spatial extents. Furthermore, prior constraints from other neuroimaging modalities with additional spatial information, such as fMRI, can be incorporated to model interactions between distinct sources to further enhance source reconstruction accuracy. The performance of Block-Champagne is quantitatively evaluated through a series of simulation experiments, which demonstrate its overall superiority under various complex scenarios (i.e., SNR, extent size, number of sources, intra-source correlation, & number of EEG channels) compared to benchmark algorithms (including LORETA, EBI-Convex, ts-Cham, L21-Sissy, & BESTIES). Validation results using deep brain stimulation EEG and epilepsy data confirm the practical feasibility of Block-Champagne. Moreover, findings from face processing multimodal data indicate that incorporating relevant and accurate priors significantly enhances source reconstruction accuracy. In conclusion, our study reveals the superiority of the proposed Block-Champagne in accurate reconstruction of extended source, positioning Block-Champagne as a highly promising tool for realistic applications where source locations and extents are of equivalent importance."

    "abstract": "Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable success in several artificial intelligence (AI) fields. Their superior performance relies on the global attention mechanism, which computes the relevance of any two input tokens to reach a global-level receptive field. Generally, the input of transformer-based models contains similar content due to natural redundancy in human language or images. Similar input contents generate similar vectors during global attention computation, which contain substantial identical or similar operands. These similar vectors introduce vector-wise redundancy, element-wise duplication, and inefficient bit-wise transitions in global attention computing. This article proposes an energy-efficient transformer processor that exploits dynamic similarity in global attention computing. First, a principal-component-prior speculation deduces the quantization region of each output pixel during matrix multiplication (MM) to terminate the computation early, which omits vector-wise redundancy. Second, a similar-vector tracked computing engine dynamically tracks and gathers similar vectors for parallel computing, which reuses the multiplication results from duplicated operands for element-wise computations reduction. Third, a bit-wise stationary processing element (BSPE) reorders the computation to minimize partial product (PP) transition counts among similar operands, reducing bit-wise logic transition energy. Fabricated in 28-nm CMOS technology, the proposed processor occupies an area of 6.4 mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>.

However, its application to legged robots remains challenging due to hybrid actuation from intermittent ground contact and redundant inputs. To address this, we propose Virtual Force-based FASA (VF-FASA), which introduces virtual forces as intermediaries to construct full-actuation conditions required by FASA. FASA generates virtual control laws based on a simplified torso dynamics model, and a matrix-weighted pseudoinverse optimization is employed to map these virtual inputs into actual torso joint torques and foot contact forces. This method achieves coordinated control of both the floating base and redundant torso, effectively leveraging joint redundancy for improved whole-body motion. Simulation results on a redundant-torso quadruped robot demonstrate robust trajectory tracking and effective whole-body coordination under dynamic locomotion. The framework expands FASA to legged systems, providing an effective approach for controlling quadruped robots."

To solve this problem, we propose a joint spatio-temporal-frequency-aware feature fusion (STFA-FF) method for VTP. Firstly, an intention recognition network is proposed to integrate spatial features and temporal features to infer driving intentions with high precision. Secondly, to fully utilize frequency-domain features, we present a multi-scale frequency-domain feature extraction (MSFDFE) module to map vehicle trajectory data into the frequency domain, incorporate the high-frequency attenuation mask to suppress high-frequency noise, and deeply integrate short-term variations with long-term trends. Additionally, a frequency-domain channel selection (FDCS) module is proposed to dynamically select key frequency channels related to driving modes. Furthermore, a multi-domain feature fusion prediction network is proposed to process the spatial, temporal and frequency-domain features to generate the final trajectory prediction results. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms mainstream approaches in prediction accuracy and robustness."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of task offloading and scheduling in Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) by incorporating dynamic task prioritization across distributed zones. The objective is to maximize task completion within deadline constraints while minimizing latency and energy consumption. To this end, the problem is formulated as a Partially Ob servable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), and solved using a Counterfactual Multi-Agent (COMA) reinforcement learning framework with centralized training and decentralized execution. The proposed approach enables distributed agents to jointly determine task priority classes, edge server associations, and CPU frequencies, leveraging counterfactual credit assignment to coordinate decision-making in both cooperative and competitive environments. Simulation results demonstrate that COMA achieves zone-aware task prioritization with improved fairness and resource distribution. It matches or exceeds the performance of centralized value-based baselines and reduces average latency by approximately 6% compared to centralized Deep Q-Learning. Additionally, it offers more balanced prioritization than multi agent deterministic policy gradient methods, highlighting its effectiveness in dynamic, distributed edge environments."

Specifically, we study a profiled train of triangular driver and witness bunches with varying precursors. It is shown analytically that the conditions for forming plateaus in the accelerating and decelerating wakefield coincide with the conditions of arrangement of bunches in the areas of their high stability, namely, in a focusing wakefield, characterized by <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$F_{r}\\gt 0$</tex-math> </inline-formula> and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\partial _{z}F_{r}\\ne 0$</tex-math> </inline-formula> throughout the bunch and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$F_{r}=0$</tex-math> </inline-formula> at its front. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the ratio of maximum densities remains constant for all bunches starting from the third one in the train. Based on the analytical plateau formation conditions, the optimal bunch parameters are derived. These parameters are then validated using a particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation, showing full agreement between theoretical predictions and numerical results. The influence of driver–witness-bunch pairs on the wakefield is also examined, revealing that after each pair passes, the accelerating field restores its original magnitude. This suggests the theoretical possibility of generating infinite bunch trains. Finally, the effect of ion mobility is considered, showing that while it limits the train length, it still allows for the existence of a short train with a plateau-kind accelerating/decelerating wakefield in the conditions of high stability of bunches."

    "abstract": "Underwater imaging for agricultural sensing often suffers from severe color distortion, low contrast, and structural degradation due to wavelength-dependent light attenuation and scattering, which challenge real-time perception on resource-constrained platforms. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight perception-consistent enhancement framework that jointly optimizes color, luminance, and structure within a unified process. A dual-domain adaptive color compensation mechanism suppresses local chromatic distortion while maintaining global color temperature balance, ensuring natural color fidelity. A gamma-guided multi-exposure fusion strategy enhances visibility across illumination ranges by integrating luminance-aware detail layers, effectively restoring fine structures without introducing artifacts. Finally, a multi-scale pyramid fusion module aggregates corrected color and structural cues to generate visually coherent outputs with low computational cost. Experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior perceptual quality and structural fidelity while maintaining high efficiency, validating its suitability for real-time deployment in low-power underwater visual sensing systems."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "This study examines how public funding influences research and development (R&D) outcomes by analyzing the performance of government-interest (GI) patents—those that explicitly acknowledge government support—relative to non-GI patents. Using a comprehensive patentometric assessment of U.S. patent data, the study challenges the conventional belief that government-backed patents inherently yield superior results. While GI patents tend to emphasize foundational and publicly aligned research, non-GI patents often outperform them in terms of citation influence and technological impact, particularly in market-driven contexts. To interpret these patterns, the study introduces a quadrant-based framework grounded in four complementary theories: the Triple Helix (TH) model, Pasteur's Quadrant (PQ), Organizational Learning (OL) theory, and Resource Dependence Theory (RDT). This framework supports a strategic understanding of how different recipients utilize government support, highlighting patterns of efficient resource use, latent potential, and underperformance. The findings suggest that public funding alone does not guarantee high-impact innovation; rather, success depends on how effectively recipient organizations align funding strategies with their internal capabilities and long-term goals. The study underscores the importance of differentiated funding approaches and improved organizational absorptive capacity. By incorporating metrics such as patent citations, concentration indices, and temporal performance, the research offers a multidimensional view of the effectiveness of public R&D investment. The results provide actionable guidance for both funders and recipients in shaping policies and strategies that maximize the societal and economic returns on public R&D investments."

    "abstract": "Surface finishing is a time-consuming, dangerous task, difficult to automate despite its necessity in many manufacturing processes. Its automation, particularly through robotics, increases productivity and relieves workers from health-critical tasks. However, challenges remain, as automated offline planning tools can result in certain areas being either neglected or overly processed. Ergodic control offers the possibility to cover target probability distributions in an online manner, by taking into account the observed coverage history. However, existing ergodic control approaches provide little flexibility in designing and adapting coverage strategies. Moreover, they come with simplifying assumptions, such as point-based dynamics, which are no longer valid for tasks where the robot is in contact with strongly varying curvatures on non-trivial surface geometries. In this work, we introduce a closed-form ergodic control framework that includes the tool imprint in the system modeling while simultaneously permitting the intuitive transfer of finish strategies, namely preferred motion directions. We build on the Spectral Multiscale Coverage (SMC) approach, augmenting it with a tool imprint model, as well as both target distributions and state-dependent movement directions extracted from human demonstrations. Through evaluations in a surface finishing task using a torque-controlled, 7-DoF, robot arm we show that our approach optimally covers surfaces according to the tool contact area, with robust error convergence."

    "abstract": "This article proposes an interleaved modified flyback converter employing pulse frequency modulation (PFM) for power factor correction (PFC) applications. The topology integrates a switching cell (SC) and coupled inductors, enabling soft commutation over a wide frequency range, a current-fed configuration, and low input current ripple. The reverse recovery losses are eliminated as the diodes block naturally, and the switches operate under zero-voltage transition (ZVT). The converter exhibits resistive input behavior and functions as a voltage follower, allowing for simplified control with a reduced component count and a single voltage feedback loop. The main features of the proposed converter include high voltage gain, galvanic isolation, and efficient AC-DC power conversion with improved power quality. A detailed analysis of the operating principle, mathematical modeling, and design procedure is presented. Experimental validation uses a 350 W prototype operating at 69kHz with a 127V RMS input and a 400V output. The results demonstrate a peak efficiency of 95.1%, a low output voltage ripple, a near-unity power factor (PF), minimal zero-crossing distortion, and a low total harmonic distortion (THD)."

However, current secure inference methods often overlook the simultaneous verification of data origins for both user inputs and model weights, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of inference outcomes. In this study, we present a novel verifiable secure inference scheme that leverages blockchain to enhance the verifiability of both the inference process and the origins of user inputs and model weights. We integrate the decentralized ledger to store the committed inputs and weights, serving as convincing data origins. We then transform neural networks into zero-knowledge proof constraints with optimized structures for the inference process. To illustrate its application scenario, we propose a regulatable privacy-preserving transaction scheme. Its regulation depends on anomaly detection on private transactions without privacy leakage, which takes the encrypted ledger as the data source and the committed detection model as the parameter source to perform our verifiable secure inference. We provide rigorous security proofs for our schemes, demonstrating their authenticity and privacy. We implement them to demonstrate their scalability through analyzing their computational and communication performance."

To address this challenge, we present the Multi-layer Representation Learning for Multi-modal Action Recognition (MR-MAR).

Moreover, we devise a Multi-modal motion Atom Learning (MAL) module to effectively capture the nonlinear relationships of multi-modal motion atoms, thereby enhancing the semantic diversity and discriminability. In the phrase encoding layer, we combine motion atoms into multi-scale motion phrases as high-level representations and carry out Motion phrase Temporal Modeling (MTM) to capture the temporal patterns by updating the hidden states. We evaluate the MR-MAR on four multi-modal benchmarks, achieving improvements ranging from 0.9% to 9.4% on NTU RGB+D 120 dataset, 0.6% to 5.5% on N-UCLA dataset, 0.4% to 6.2% on PKU-MMD dataset, and competitive performance on Toyota-Smarthome dataset."

    "abstract": "Enterprises are rapidly scaling generative artificial intelligence, yet evidence is mixed on whether adoption translates into measurable sustainability gains and under what conditions such gains arise. This study theorizes and tests a capability-based pathway in which adoption improves operations capability, which in turn enhances sustainable performance, with the payoff contingent on environmental dynamism. We assemble a multi-year panel of publicly listed manufacturing firms in China and construct firm-year measures for generative artificial intelligence adoption, operations capability, sustainable performance, and environmental dynamism from public disclosures and administrative sources. Empirically, we estimate twoway fixed-effects models at the firm level, evaluate a moderated-mediation structure with clustered bootstrap inference, and conduct extensive robustness checks and heterogeneity analyses. The results show that adoption is positively associated with higher operations capability—reflected in reliability, responsiveness, and process discipline—and that this capability mediates the link to sustainable performance. The indirect effect is stronger when environmental dynamism is high, indicating that turbulent product and policy environments amplify the value of faster information flows and auditable processes. Findings remain stable across alternative measurements, lag structures, and sample partitions. The study clarifies when and how generative artificial intelligence creates sustainability value: not through technology presence alone, but through the operational capability it enables under dynamic conditions."

    "abstract": "Objective: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading global health threat. The automatic classification of phonocardiogram (PCG) signals is crucial for their early diagnosis, yet existing models are often limited by analyzing features from only a single domain (time or frequency), failing to fuse complementary information. This study aims to develop a model that overcomes this limitation by effectively integrating both time-domain and frequency-domain features to improve classification accuracy and robustness. Methods: We propose a novel end-to-end dual-branch deep learning model. The time-domain branch utilizes a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Transformer blocks to capture instantaneous dynamics and long-range dependencies. The frequency-domain branch uses a ResNet to extract robust spectral patterns from Mel-spectrograms. A key innovation is our bidirectional cross-attention fusion module, which facilitates deep interaction and mutual enhancement between the two feature modalities. Furthermore, we employ a transfer learning strategy to ensure robust performance on smaller or more challenging datasets. Results: Comprehensive evaluations on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. On the 2016 PhysioNet Challenge dataset, it reached an accuracy of 98.86% and an F1-score of 97.19%, significantly outperforming existing baseline methods. Conclusion and Significance: Our dual-branch fusion model provides a more effective and robust framework for heart sound classification. This work offers strong support for the development of highly accurate automated tools for the auxiliary diagnosis of CVDs, thereby holding the potential to enhance early detection and improve clinical outcomes."

    "abstract": "Zoonotic diseases, transmitted between animals and humans, pose a persistent global health challenge. Most prior studies have focused on detecting individual pathogens (e.g., influenza, brucellosis) while giving limited attention to transmission risk—the likelihood and pathways of disease spread—thus restricting their generalizability. This study is guided by the hypothesis that effective monitoring of zoonotic diseases requires distinguishing between mild, self-limiting cases and high-transmission scenarios, and that integrating a structured rule-based scoring framework with machine learning models and SHAP interpretability can systematically classify transmission risks across multiple zoonotic diseases. The dataset is structured at the disease level (one row = one disease) to enable systematic risk classification, while future extensions will incorporate case-level data for enhanced predictive validity. The framework evaluates transmission risk by assigning weighted values to epidemiological and environmental features, including transmission type, host animals, contagious period, and severity. To validate this approach, three machine learning models—Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression—are applied. Random Forest achieves the highest accuracy (0.92), while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis enhances interpretability by identifying animal involvement, transmission type, and high-risk groups as key drivers of risk. Unlike prior disease-specific approaches, the resulting Streamlit-based prototype enables real-time transmission risk evaluation under user-defined conditions (e.g., transmission mode, animal density, high-risk groups, environmental settings). By providing actionable insights and tailored recommendations—such as allocating greater resources for high-risk scenarios—the framework offers a practical decision-support tool for proactive zoonotic disease surveillance and public health response."

This paper proposes a novel RIS-assisted joint multi-domain index modulation (IM) orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) system termed RIS-JMDIM-OTFS. This system leverages transmit antenna, receive antenna, and delay-Doppler (DD) indices within the OTFS framework to achieve higher transmission efficiency. Additionally, it exploits the electromagnetic properties of the RIS to optimize the wireless channel, improving bit error rate (BER) performance. To reduce receiver hardware costs and energy overhead, a deep neural network-based bit sequence detection (DNN-BSD) method is introduced, which effectively reduces the computational complexity associated with high modulation orders during detection. Simulation results demonstrate that the RIS-JMDIM-OTFS system outperforms state-of-the-art IM OTFS system in terms in both transmission efficiency and BER performance. Furthermore, DNN-BSD achieves near-identical detection performance to maximum likelihood (ML) detection while significantly reducing computational complexity."

To enable effective visualization on local, low-end machines, recent advances in view synthesis techniques, such as neural radiance fields, utilize neural networks to generate novel visualizations for volumetric scenes. However, these methods focus on reconstruction quality rather than facilitating interactive visualization exploration, such as feature extraction and tracking. We introduce VolSegGS, a novel Gaussian splatting framework that supports interactive segmentation and tracking in dynamic volumetric scenes for exploratory visualization and analysis. Our approach utilizes deformable 3D Gaussians to represent a dynamic volumetric scene, allowing for real-time novel view synthesis. For accurate segmentation, we leverage the view-independent colors of Gaussians for coarse-level segmentation and refine the results with an affinity field network for fine-level segmentation. Additionally, by embedding segmentation results within the Gaussians, we ensure that their deformation enables continuous tracking of segmented regions over time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VolSegGS with several time-varying datasets and compare our solutions against state-of-the-art methods. With the ability to interact with a dynamic scene in real time and provide flexible segmentation and tracking capabilities, VolSegGS offers a powerful solution under low computational demands. This framework unlocks exciting new possibilities for time-varying volumetric data analysis and visualization."

    "abstract": "Seafloor classification and mapping are crucial for understanding the composition and spatial distribution of submarine materials. Currently, data-driven modeling of underwater acoustic remote sensing data is widely adopted in seafloor classification. However, as research and applications expand, limitations of data-driven approaches—such as the lack of theoretical support, weak interpretability, and poor transferability—have become evident. In contrast, inherent geoacoustic properties of the seafloor, such as roughness and acoustic impedance, can be quantitatively inverted using acoustic scattering models. These properties exhibit objectivity, determinism, and interpretability, thereby providing robust constraints for data-driven modeling. Consequently, a novel seafloor classification strategy is proposed that integrates acoustic inversion with data-driven modeling. Firstly, a geoacoustic inversion model based on the angular response (AR) curve is established to obtain seafloor roughness and acoustic impedance as property features. Then, these features are fused with data features derived from acoustic backscatter mosaics and seafloor digital elevation models (DEMs). Finally, a deep neural network (DNN) is constructed for training, testing, and classification. To evaluate performance, the proposed method was applied to three survey areas with varying seafloor terrain complexity and validated by field data (seafloor photographs). Compared to purely data-driven approaches, integrating property features improved the overall classification accuracy by 4.6%, 3.9%, and 5.4%, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively exploits seafloor geoacoustic properties, exhibiting strong generalization and transferability across diverse marine environments. This study provides a valuable reference for integrating acoustics theory into seafloor classification methods."

The control framework integrates backstepping and sliding mode techniques to handle both nonlinearities and disturbances. Moreover, an adaptive parameter tuning strategy based on grey wolf optimizer and radial basis function neural network is introduced to tailor the control response to varying shimmy frequencies. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in suppressing shimmy and enhancing steering angle tracking across diverse driving conditions."

By evaluating the population state in real time, the algorithm achieves adaptive bidirectional switching between global exploration and local exploitation. It also employs phase-differentiated migration and processing to leverage their complementary strengths, improving population diversity and convergence efficiency. To strengthen search performance near complex constraint boundaries, a local exploitation strategy with adaptive constraint relaxation anchored to the main population’s feasibility is introduced. Additionally, an archive update mechanism guided by reference vectors is developed to enhance the quality and uniformity of the solution distribution. Experimental studies on classical benchmark problems and real-world blast furnace ironmaking processes demonstrate that AAPSMT achieves notable performance advantages and shows strong potential for practical applications."

    "abstract": "Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a core technology in the perception layer of the Passive Internet of Things (Passive IoT). The complex external environments and an increase in the number of tags would cause channel contention and data conflicts during the reading process, which significantly affects the positioning accuracy and reading performance, resulting in the loss of data information stored in the tags. Although there are many methods to improve the reading performance of RFID system, most of them evaluate the reading performance through anti-collision protocol to optimize the position of reader and antenna. However, when moving antennas and readers read multi-tag, the solutions are neither efficient nor reliable. To improve the performance of RFID systems, this paper proposes an improved multi-tag position measuremnet for UNet networks, which can optimize the reading performance of RFID system. Firstly, for the electronic interference in complex environments, an experimental platform assisted visual intelligence is designed to construct the RFID multi-tag position measurement and performance analysis system. Secondly, the image deblurring for the UNet network improved by Implicit Neural Representations (INR) and Residual Fast Fourier Transform (Res FFT) is proposed to improve the image quality of the degraded multi-tag image. Finally, the 3D coordinates of the tags are found by YOLOv9 in the image coordinate system, which are subsequently converted to actual 3D distributions. It can improve the spatial distribution of RFID tags to Combine the prior knowledge of RFID 3D space in visual intelligence with the indicators of reading performance, thereby better guiding more effective physical tags placement methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the PSNR of the proposed method is 30.17 dB, and at least 2% better than the state-of-the-art algorithms, which indicates that the method proposed can accurately obtain the 3D distribution of multi-tag. Our system can capture the multi-tag 3D distribution corresponding to the maximum reading distance, thereby guiding the 3D structure distribution of multi-tag to enhance RFID reading performance."

It extends LightGCN to social recommendation scenarios, achieving better recommendation performance with low computational costs. An attention-based representation fusion module merges user representations from user-item bipartite graphs and social network graphs into a unified embedding. This module learns importance weights of different data modalities and uses normalization to avoid embedding dimensionality expansion with more network layers, ensuring stable parameter learning. An asymmetric binary GCN structure is also adopted, with two GCNs of different layer counts, K layers for user-item bipartite graphs and K/2 layers for social network graphs. By fusing their layer-wise outputs at intervals, the model improves semantic similarity between user interest representations and social influence representations. Experiments on three real-world datasets show ARF-LGN outperforms six state-of-the-art models. On Last.FM, it improves Recall@20 and NDCG@20 by 2.53% and 3.55% vs. LightGCN, on Ciao, 2.48% and 2.70% vs. DiffNet++, on Epinions, 4.42% and 3.93% vs. DiffNet++.

    "abstract": "Foot-operated interaction devices have recently attracted attention, with possible use in motion navigation in virtual environments. Isometric foot-operated devices measure the force exerted by the operator’s foot and use it to control the target object. Because the foot needs to move only minimally, the isometric method is suitable for use in small spaces. However, with the isometric method, there is a difference between the intended direction of force and the actual direction of force, which can result in unintended operation. To overcome this problem, this study proposes devices that accurately measure the intended force direction by separating the areas that measure forces in the horizontal and vertical planes, leveraging the fact that the foot is composed of multiple regions (toes, forefoot, and rearfoot) that can move relative to each other. Experiments are conducted using the six developed operation devices. The results show that three of these devices, including the device that measures the horizontal force based on the sole and the vertical force based on the toes, outperform a conventional device. It is found that all of the proposed devices outperform the conventional device in terms of the time required to complete tasks that involve movement in various directions."

However, the direct exchange of sensitive data between agents raises critical privacy risks, hindering its broader adoption across safety-critical applications. This paper presents a privacy-preserving cooperative tracking framework that rigorously maintains bounded coupling errors, which is a crucial requirement for collision avoidance in vehicular platoons. Departing from conventional methods that compromise privacy through explicit state sharing for error mitigation, our proposed algorithm achieves dual objectives: maintaining prescribed error constraints while preserving agent state confidentiality in directed communication networks with time-varying interaction weights. We establish sufficient conditions for achieving cooperative-tracking consensus with predefined error constraints and characterize the quantitative relationship between the asymptotic convergence rate and control gain parameters. Furthermore, we analyse the privacy-preserving performance against internal and external adversaries, demonstrating that the probability of an adversary inferring states within a finite neighborhood of ground-truth values can be rendered arbitrarily small, even while adversaries retain access to identical communication data streams. This extends classical initial-state privacy to the entire operational timeline under time-varying directed topologies. Numerical examples including an application of cooperative adaptive cruise control demonstrate our proposed algorithm’s efficacy."

    "abstract": "Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image segmentation faces three persistent challenges in current methodologies: generation of spurious isolated pixels due to speckle noise interference, limited adaptability to multi-scale targets, and structural degradation at boundary regions. To address these limitations, we propose the Non-local and Regional-level Conditional Random Field with Edge Preservation (NRLCRF-EP) framework, which synergistically integrates pixel-level non-local connections, multi-scale region-level connections, and edge-preserving mechanisms. By constructing long-range dependencies in the sparse conditional random field, our model reduces isolated pixel segmentation caused by similar scattering characteristics distributed non-locally. Building upon this, we further introduce region-level connections to enhance the scale adaptability of segmentation through spatial correlations at different scales. Furthermore, the embedded maximum likelihood edge detection module preserves structural integrity by maintaining boundary continuity during energy minimization, thereby effectively resolving the issue of boundary detail loss. Experiments were conducted on 23 images sourced from RADARSAT-2, GAOFEN-3, AIRSAR, ALOS-1, TERRASAR-X, and EMISAR. The results demonstrate that NRLCRF-EP significantly outperforms other image segmentation methods. Specifically, it achieves a Precision of 85.31%, a Recall of 84.81%, a mIoU of 68.87%, a F1-score of 84.49%, and an Edge-IoU of 70.41%, confirming the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.

While fiber optic temperature sensors (FOTS) offer multiple advantages, achieving a synergistic combination of cost-effectiveness, compact dimensions, and high integration remains a critical challenge for practical implementations. This work presents an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven solution featuring a miniaturized, cost efficient fiber-optic leaky-mode temperature speckle sensor with integrated optoelectronic transceiver functionality. The system employs a fiber microsphere at the emission end for light source coupling and collection, while a fiber taper at the detection end facilitates modal leakage from the fiber core. Temperature sensitive material integrated within the sensing region modulates the refractive index (RI) in response to environmental temperature variations, thereby altering the specklegram characteristics of the leaked modes. A convolutional vision transformer (ConViT)-based regression model was trained to establish quantitative mapping between speckle image features and temperature measurements. Comparative analysis demonstrated superior performance against convolutional neural network (CNN), vision transformer (Vit), and modified CNN architectures, achieving a median absolute error (MedAE) of 0.256 °C. This integrated approach effectively addresses the critical triad of cost reduction, miniaturization, and functional integration, potentially advancing the development of fiber-optic thermometry."

    "abstract": "Real-world wireless transmitter frontends exhibit certain nonlinear behavior, e.g., signal clipping by a Power Amplifier (PA). Although many resource allocation solutions do not consider this for simplicity, it leads to inaccurate results or a reduced number of degrees of freedom, not achieving the global performance. In this work, we propose an optimal PA distortion-aware power allocation strategy in a downlink orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) based massive multiple-input multiple-output (M-MIMO) system. Assuming a soft-limiter PA model, where the transmission occurs under small-scale independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) Rayleigh fading channel, we derive the wideband signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) and formulate the power allocation problem. Most interestingly, the distortion introduced by the PA leads to an SNDR-efficient operating point without explicit transmit power constraints. While the optimization problem is non-convex, we decouple it into a non-convex total power allocation problem and a convex power distribution problem among the users (UEs). We propose an alternating optimization algorithm to find the optimum solution. Our simulation results show significant sum-rate gains over existing distortion-neglecting solutions, e.g., a median 4 times increase and a median 50% increase for a 64-antenna and 512-antenna base station serving 60 users, respectively."

Each agent seeks to minimize a local, possibly non-stationary objective using only noisy function evaluations while maintaining coordination with its neighbors over a dynamic communication graph. Motivated by applications with heavy-tailed disturbances and limited communication, the study develops and analyzes a distributed Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) consensus-based algorithm under relaxed regularity assumptions, where local gradients are only Hölder continuous, encompassing robust loss functions. The main technical contribution is a tracking analysis that yields explicit bounds on the expected tracking error and identifies a key threshold condition governing stability under constant step-size operation. Complementing the theoretical results, a comprehensive empirical validation across multiple network topologies and noise models confirms the theoretical predictions and illustrates that stronger non-stationarity narrows the admissible step-size regime. The results provide both theoretical guarantees and practical tuning guidelines for gradient-free distributed tracking in noisy, time-varying environments."

In this article, a novel passive snubber method based on capacitive compensation for drive-side parasitic capacitance and drive timing differences is proposed to overcome these difficulties. First, capacitive compensation model of drive side is built to resolve voltage imbalance, which influenced by drive-side parasitic capacitors. Then, capacitive compensation model of drive timing based on the switching characteristics of SiC MOSFET is proposed to resolve voltage imbalance which influenced by drive timing differences. Finally, experiments are carried out on a four-stage series-connected SiC MOSFETs. Compared with the traditional passive method that uses the same capacitors, the maximum voltage of SiC MOSFETs is reduced from 887 to 809 V, and all of the voltage imbalance ratios of devices are less than 2.3% at 3.2 kV pulse output. Additionally, the maximum switching loss of devices is reduced from 118.0 to 59.2 <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">μ</i>J, and the pulse output rising time can be achieved 8.7 ns, and the results prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Remote embodied intelligence relies on the seamless transmission of rich multi-modal sensory information, particularly vision and touch, to enable intelligent agents to collaboratively perceive, interact with, and manipulate physical environments. However, transmitting such high-dimensional and heterogeneous data over wireless channels in real time poses substantial challenges in terms of bandwidth, latency, and semantic integrity. In this paper, we propose a novel vision-tactile fusion semantic communication (VT-FSC) framework tailored for remote embodied intelligence applications. By leveraging cross-modal feature fusion and attention-guided semantic compression, the proposed system transforms raw visual and tactile data into a unified low-dimensional semantic representation. This compact representation is then robustly transmitted through noisy wireless channels and decoded at the receiver to reconstruct both the visual scene and the tactile signal accurately. To ensure perceptual alignment, encoder and decoder are jointly optimized via human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms. Experimental results in the multi-model dataset show that our method achieves up to 15% higher ST-SIM and 47% lower RMSE than baselines, validating the effectiveness of our framework in achieving high semantic compression rates and accurate perceptual reconstruction for remote embodied intelligence applications."

A Lagrangian-based optimization approach is employed to analytically derive 21 minimum copper loss reference cases, which are generalized through a sector-based reference mode selector with anomaly-sector correction to comprehensively cover 153 distinct fault scenarios. Unlike existing generalization methods that rely on restrictive assumptions or simplified reference formulations, the proposed approach maintains optimal reference generation under complex multi-fault conditions. This unified strategy achieves full fault coverage with reduced memory requirements compared to conventional lookup-table, curve fitting, or online optimization schemes, while preserving low torque ripple and minimum copper losses. The framework is also inherently scalable, enabling straightforward extension to higher order fault conditions. Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed control in minimizing losses and maintaining low ripple torque across all tested fault scenarios."

    "abstract": "Interactions among circular RNAs (circRNAs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) involve almost all stages of the circRNA life cycle. Therefore, circRNA-RBP binding site identification is extremely important for the regulation of human diseases. Various approaches have been used to identify RBP binding sites on circRNAs. Sadly, these approaches are frequently constrained by insufficient feature learning and poor scalability. As a result, we provide a novel model named iDeep-cancer that predicts circRNA-RBP interactions solely using circRNA sequences. A hybrid deep learning model and feature encoding are used in the iDeep-cancer technique. In order to create the feature space, feature encoding uses four feature extraction techniques while accounting for the chemical makeup of circRNA sequences. The hybrid network includes an improved dense convolutional network (DenseNet), a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU), and a self-attention mechanism (Self-attention). DenseNet is used to learn high-level localized features, and the combination of BiGRU and self-attention captures long-term dependencies in sequences. We conducted ablation tests and compared iDeep-cancer with other cutting-edge techniques on 13 datasets in order to verify its efficacy. Findings indicate that iDeep-cancer performs better than current techniques."

    "abstract": "Dense focal stack images inherently encode depth cues and are crucial for various 3D vision applications. However, existing generation methods are susceptible to misalignment and introduce a domain gap between synthetic and real-world data due to off-axis aberrations. To address these challenges, we introduce DFS-Net, an aberration-aware dense focal stack image generation network. DFS-Net consists of two core modules: all-in-focus image synthesis and aberration-aware point spread function (PSF) generation. The all-in-focus image synthesis is achieved through a densely connected fusion network based on multi-scale focus migration and focus property detection. This fusion network can effectively fuse misaligned multi-focus images into an all-in-focus image. The aberration-aware PSF generation is realized through a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network. Supervised by ray-tracing-based PSFs, the MLP network can generate spatially varying PSFs for arbitrary spatial positions and focus distances. By selecting a set of focus distances, the generated PSF maps are locally convolved with the all-in-focus image to produce an aberration-aware dense focal stack. We conduct extensive comparative experiments on all-in-focus image fusion and focal stack generation against state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that DFS-Net can synthesize all-in-focus images with high subjective and objective quality, as well as generate dense focal stacks that closely approximate ray-tracing results. In addition, we conduct comparative experiments on the depth-from-focus and salient object detection tasks using the generated focal stacks. The experimental results demonstrate that our DFS-Net can significantly enhance the performance of existing depth-from-focus and salient object detection models. The code and dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/North-Li/DFS-Net."

    "abstract": "Electric vehicles (EVs) have the potential to revolutionize the energy and transportation sectors, yet widespread adoption faces challenges, notably the complexity of managing energy demand. While prior studies have modeled EV impacts in developed economies, little work has analyzed such impacts under the constraints of fossil fuel-dominated, subsidy-heavy systems like Iran. So, this paper investigates the impacts of EV integration on Iran's energy and transportation infrastructure, advocating that EVs are instrumental in decarbonizing and grid balancing. Our focus turns to Iran's energy landscape as a compelling case study for a fossil-fuel-rich country, due to its specific geographical aspects and unique energy sector challenges. The study extensively analyses historical peak demand data and national statistics, underscoring the urgent need for more sustainable energy management practices and the modernization of transportation systems. The analysis emphasizes the critical challenge posed by surging peak power demand in Iran while highlighting the pivotal role that EVs could play in reshaping Iran's transportation and energy sectors. Numerical analysis reveals that managing EV energy through V1G and V2G can help alleviate the peak demands, providing a flexible alternative to traditional network upgrades. Moreover, the calculated estimates of peak power demand for unconstrained charging versus the impact of V1G and V2G can assist decision-makers in assessing future energy flexibility requirements, identifying strategies to overcome potential barriers to EV adoption, and exploring different scenarios."

    "abstract": "Medical Question Answering (MQA) systems are vital for clinical decision support, yet most existing models struggle with complex query processing, fine-grained context awareness, and explainability. This study introduces ICONQUER, a transformer-based MQA model that integrates instruction-finetuned embeddings and knowledge graph (KG) augmentation to improve semantic coherence, contextual relevance, interpretability and response accuracy. We designed five sequential experiments to evaluate ICONQUER across MedQA and HotPotQA datasets: (i) representation analysis of multiple embeddings, (ii) answer generation on MedQA development data, (iii) validation on the MedQA test set, (iv) robustness testing with external biomedical knowledge sources (Wikipedia, BioPortal), and (v) cross-domain generalization on HotPotQA. Results show that ICONQUER achieves the strongest semantic alignment (cosine similarity = 0.9446 on MedQA train; 0.9387 on MedQA test; 0.914 on HotPotQA), consistently outperforming state-of-the-art MQA systems leveraging E5, BioBERT, and BERT-Large baselines. While external knowledge enrichment yielded limited benefits, knowledge graph integration substantially improved interpretability and the capture of semantic relationships. This advancement enabled more contextually precise answers, positioning ICONQUER as a promising tool for clinical decision-making. Future work will extend ICONQUER by incorporating broader biomedical ontologies (e.g., SNOMED CT, UMLS), clinical trial repositories, and electronic health records. These enhancements aim to improve adaptability across medical subfields and to strengthen explainability through intuitive medical reasoning, thereby supporting global applicability. Further efforts will address the integration of advanced AI techniques, reinforcement of data security, support for multilingual use, and improvements in transparency and flexibility."

    "abstract": "When faults occur in the distribution network accessed with photovoltaic (PV) sources, the performance of the traditional power direction identification criterion is affected by the PV low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) control strategy. The paper analyses the distribution characteristics of negative-sequence voltage and current after forward and backward phase-to-phase faults, and the change characteristics of the positive-sequence measured impedance angle after three-phase faults, and accordingly proposes a composite fault direction identification method applicable to distribution networks with high proportion of PV sources. The proposed method makes use of the negative-sequence voltage magnitude to distinguish phase-to-phase and three-phase faults. For phase-to-phase faults, the direction identification is achieved based on the negative-sequence current magnitude, while for three-phase faults, the operation range of traditional power direction criterion is adjusted to improve the operating reliability. Further, the threshold selection of the proposed method is discussed. Theoretical analysis and simulation test show that, compared with the traditional power direction criterion, the proposed method has outstanding performance in systems with high proportion of PV sources, especially for the faults with high transition resistance."

Existing empirical parameterizations lack a robust physical basis and exhibit limited generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a remote sensing–based framework for the first global-scale estimation of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">h<sub>s,max</sub></i>, which integrates physical constraints and data-driven methods.

Subsequently, XGBoost–based inversion models were constructed separately for different land surface types, with site-level meteorological variables and the back-calculated <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">h<sub>s,max</sub></i> as inputs.

Results demonstrate that the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">h<sub>s,max</sub></i> models for different land surface types achieved high accuracy, with a mean root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.079 and a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.92. A contribution analysis using SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) reveals that relative humidity (RH) is the dominant predictor, while secondary factors vary by land surface type. The global monthly <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">h<sub>s,max</sub></i> estimates for 2001–2020 exhibit distinct climate-driven spatial patterns. Temporal variability is low (CV < 10%) in humid regions but exceeds 20% in arid regions. In conclusion, the proposed parameterization framework shows both the physical consistency and high accuracy in global scale <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">h<sub>s,max</sub></i> estimation, providing essential parameter support for studies of land–atmosphere interactions."

    "abstract": "Vehicle-Infrastructure Collaboration (VIC) integrates vehicles and roadside infrastructure using advanced communication technologies, forming a crucial component of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In a VIC system, tasks generated by vehicles can either be processed locally or offloaded to nearby edge servers. Current research often focuses on optimizing task scheduling but overlooks the inherent spatiotemporal correlations among tasks, which can lead to redundant computations due to similar tasks producing identical results. Additionally, the diversity in research scenarios and model constructions has resulted in the absence of a unified simulation verification platform, making it difficult to compare and validate various scheduling algorithms. To address these challenges, we have developed a comprehensive VIC simulation platform (CVSP). This platform not only features vehicle simulation capabilities like those of SUMO for modeling vehicle movement, but it also allows for the customization of driving scenarios and configurations, including edge resource settings, and incorporates a unified algorithm execution module for evaluating the performance of scheduling algorithms. Using CVSP can provide a clearer understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of scheduling algorithms, which in turn benefits the development of VIC systems. To tackle the spatiotemporal correlations observed in vehicular tasks, we propose a branch and bound algorithm based on computation-reuse (BB-CR). This algorithm integrates a computational reuse model derived from fused vehicle and road data. We simulate both non-congested and congested scenarios of vehicles traversing intersections to validate the performance of the baseline and BB-CR on the CVSP. The results highlight the versatility of the CVSP, showing that the BB-CR algorithm reduces system costs and minimizes the probability of task loss compared to the baseline. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/lzp991105/comprehensive-VIC-simulation-platform.git."

    "abstract": "Deep neural network (DNN) models are crucial for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. In a multi-access edge computing (MEC) system, IoT devices dispatch their requests to a nearby edge server to accelerate DNN inference. Recently, processing-in-memory (PIM) accelerators have emerged for DNN inference due to their power and area efficiency. However, current scheduling methods primarily focus on single-DNN workloads and do not fully utilize PIM’s potential for managing multi-DNN workloads in MEC scenarios. Additionally, PIM accelerators face challenges such as inflexible resource allocation and costly write operations, constraining the direct application of GPU scheduling techniques. In this paper, we define the multi-DNN scheduling problem on the PIM accelerator. To reduce the problem’s complexity, we propose a heuristic optimization algorithm, called Leader-Follower. Using this algorithm, we present PimShare, a scheduler for the PIM accelerator to process multi-DNN workloads. PimShare schedules multi-DNN inference requests to enable both temporal and spatial multiplexing, which can enhance hardware utilization. Compared with baseline scheduling methods, including those adapted from GPU scheduling, PimShare can achieve up to a two-order-of-magnitude improvement in throughput and scale the high throughput to workloads containing 18 DNN models. In addition, PimShare reduces write operations and processing latency."

    "abstract": "Video platforms have increasingly been observed forming partnerships with other service providers (e.g., digital music service provider) through the launch of membership bundles. This paper analytically investigates such strategic choices of competing video platforms regarding two paid membership strategies, i.e., standard plans and membership bundles. In the basic model, the chosen service provider is assumed to exhibit similar horizontal attributes as the video platform. Therefore, compared to standard plans, membership bundles reinforce the intensity of mismatches, even though they bring incremental benefits. Our study unveils the following intriguing findings. First, when the incremental value consumers receive from membership bundles is sufficiently small (large), both platforms prefer to adopt standard plans (membership bundles). Second, in the scenario where the incremental value is moderate, both platforms can be better off by adopting asymmetric membership strategies if network effects are strong. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the provision of membership bundles will intensify platform competition. This result implies that the provision of membership bundles may hurt platforms' profitability when network effects are very weak and the incremental value is not very large. However, given that membership bundles can increase social welfare, policymakers may encourage their applications. In the model extensions, the robustness of our results is tested. We allow for alternative preference correlations across bundled services, endogenize the revenue-sharing rate via the incremental value created by bundling, and introduce asymmetric intensities of network effects for different plans."

While Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) provides significant advantages, it still faces considerable challenges when dealing with such scenarios. This paper proposes DynaMo, a decentralized UAV framework addressing the challenges of tracking fast-moving vehicles in dynamic environments. DynaMo prioritizes spatiotemporal relevance and adapts to diverse vehicle behaviors with a novel freshness metric.

Additionally, a novel theoretical framework that aids in the analysis of the suggested system's performance is offered. The applied strain has a linear relationship with the circuit output voltage, and this system can also be made more sensitive. The impact of ambient temperature in the strain measurement is also deliberated in details. The measured results are compared with the theoretical results with change in ambient temperature variations and it is found that the results align completely with the proposed new theory with considering ambient temperature variations.

Despite these advancements, many existing designs of soft hands still lack effective in-hand vision and the ability for each finger to achieve active multi-degree-of-freedom motion. This paper proposes a cable-driven soft robotic hand that can achieve dexterous grasping and manipulation, vision-guided grasping, vision-based slip detection and compensation, as well as visually servoed in-hand manipulation. The hand has five soft fingers, each capable of independent flexion/extension motion and bidirectional ad/abduction motion. A red-green-blue-depth (RGB-D) camera is integrated into the palm of the soft hand to enable in-hand vision capability. Modeling of the soft hand is established to analyze its kinematics, statics, and manipulability. A series of experiments are conducted to demonstrate its dexterous grasping and manipulation capabilities on a variety of objects. Using 3D point cloud data from the in-palm camera, an effective vision-guided grasping strategy is developed to grasp objects on a table. The in-hand vision also enables slip detection and compensation during grasping to maintain the grasp stability. Furthermore, a hierarchical, visually servoed controller is developed to perform closed-loop in-hand object manipulation. With its high dexterity and visual feedback capabilities, the soft hand will find important applications such as household object manipulation and food picking/sorting, and may also be used as a prosthetic hand or an auxiliary hand for humans."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the evolution of hydrogen (H) behavior in back-gated IGZO/HfO. transistors subjected to low-temperature annealing (200 °C in air), focusing on its impact on initial electrical characteristics (Id-Vg) and positive bias temperature instability (PBTI). For initial electrical performance, a negative threshold voltage shift is observed in the Id-Vg curve after annealing. Combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, this shift is attributed to an increase in hydroxyl-related hydrogen within the IGZO layer. Regarding device reliability, a model-based decoupling analysis is employed to separate the contributions of electron trapping (e-trapping) and hydrogen doping (H-doping). The results reveal that hydrogen-induced degradation is suppressed by approximately 10.67% to 26.02% after annealing. Based on this, a physical model for H states in IGZO/HfO2 films during annealing was proposed. These results offer new insight into the role of hydrogen in IGZO devices and provide a theoretical and experimental foundation for the optimization of H-doping during process integration."

Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has introduced new opportunities to enhance the design study process, providing capabilities such as creative problem-solving, data handling, and insightful analysis. However, despite their growing popularity, there remains a lack of systematic understanding of how LLMs can effectively assist researchers in visualization-specific design studies. In this paper, we conducted a multi-stage qualitative study to fill this gap, which involved 30 design study researchers from diverse backgrounds and expertise levels. Through in-depth interviews and carefully-designed questionnaires, we investigated strategies for utilizing LLMs, the challenges encountered, and the practices used to overcome them. We further compiled the roles that LLMs can play across different stages of the design study process. Our findings highlight practical implications to inform visualization practitioners, and also provide a framework for leveraging LLMs to facilitate the design study process in visualization research."

However, existing research lacks methods that achieve both high accuracy and real-time performance. To address this, we propose a combined estimation framework based on the generalized momentum Kalman filter (GMKF) and the error-state Kalman filter (ESKF), aiming to accurately and frequently estimate external disturbances during dynamic interactions with the environment. The GMKF is used to estimate ground reaction forces (GRFs), which are then fed into the ESKF to obtain the robot’s basic states and external wrenches. The proposed framework is experimentally validated on the BQR3 quadruped robot, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority."

    "abstract": "In modern datacenters, the effectiveness of end-to-end congestion control (CC) is quickly diminishing with the rapid bandwidth evolution. Per-hop flow control (FC) can react to congestion more promptly. However, a coarse-grained FC can result in Head-Of-Line (HOL) blocking. A fine-grained, per-flow FC can eliminate HOL blocking caused by flow control, however, it does not scale well. This paper presents Pyrrha, a scalable flow control approach that provably eliminates HOL blocking while using a minimum number of queues. In Pyrrha, flow control first takes effect on the root of the congestion, i.e., the port where congestion occurs. And then flows are controlled according to their contributed congestion roots. A prototype of Pyrrha is implemented on Tofino2 switches. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, the average FCT of uncongested flows is reduced by 42%-98%, and 99th-tail latency can be <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1.6\\times $</tex-math> </inline-formula>-<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$215\\times $</tex-math> </inline-formula> lower, without compromising the performance of congested flows."

    "abstract": "Bitsliced cipher implementations demonstrate enhanced performance and security on high-end processors through specialized instruction utilization. However, IoT processors, particularly 32-bit architectures, present significant implementation challenges due to limited register sizes and instruction sets, hindering efficient parallelism in bitsliced SPN ciphers. This study presents optimization strategies for implementing bitsliced SPN ciphers on 32-bit processors using common instruction sets. The linear layer optimization employs a decomposition algorithm that transforms complex permutation operations into minimal instruction sequences. This approach recursively identifies optimal instruction combinations while maintaining computational efficiency. For the non-linear layer, operations are constrained to basic logic instructions (NOT, AND, OR, XOR). A novel encoding method for the Bit-slice Gate Complexity (BGC) model is proposed to optimize S-box transformations within these constraints using Boolean satisfiability solvers. Additionally, a comprehensive benchmarking framework facilitates standardized performance evaluation across implementations. Experimental evaluation of the optimized implementations on ARM Cortex-M and Xtensa LX processors demonstrates significant performance improvements. The proposed techniques achieve reductions of 9.7% and 67.6% in Cycles Per Byte for AES and QARMAv2 implementations, respectively."

A key architectural innovation is a shared error-location solver that exploits the inherent error correlation between the sub-codes, which substantially reduces hardware complexity. The resulting structure not only maintains the original DEC capability but is also shown to deterministically correct additional error patterns that are uncorrectable by the conventional single-code approach. Implementation of a (12,8) decoder using this architecture demonstrates a 68% area reduction and a 21% improvement in operating speed over a conventional decoder on GF(2<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">8</sup>).

Image captioning with context and content is a significant research problem. In this work, we attempted to develop a storytelling system that can caption images, considering content, context, syntax, and knowledge. Our methodology combines Capsule Networks for image encoding, Knowledge Graphs for content and context awareness, and Transformer Neural Networks for decoding. During feature extraction, spatial, geometrical, and orientational details are extracted using Capsule Networks. The corpus is passed through the Knowledge Graph to equip it with content, context, and semantics. The decoding phase combines the Knowledge Graph and the Transformer Neural Network for knowledge-driven captioning. Our model is trained on MSCOCO, Flickr8k, and Flickr32k, and tested on MSCOCO, Flickr8k, Flickr32k, and Google Images. The results provide good content and context understanding with B4: 49.97, M: 39.14, C: 136.53, and R: 74.61. The usage of adverbs and adjectives within the generated sentence, according to the objects’ geometrical and semantic relationship, is phenomenal.

By eliminating PTS doping, the LTG avoids drawbacks such as increased band-to-band tunneling and random dopant fluctuations while maintaining strong gate-to-channel electrostatics through a layered trench design. We benchmark the LTG against conventional leakage control methods–PTS, bottom dielectric isolation (BDI), local BDI (LBDI), and trench gate (TG)–under realistic fabrication variations, particularly a 6 nm source/drain over-etch. Under these conditions, the PTS structure suffers a 2,840-fold increase in off-current and a 3.84×103-fold reduction in on/off ratio, whereas the LTG shows only 21.5-fold and 4.69×102-fold changes, respectively, demonstrating significantly improved robustness. A 3-stage ring oscillator simulation reveals that the LTG achieves 1.9% shorter delay and 2.4% lower dynamic power under identical conditions. These results highlight the LTG’s enhanced gate-to-channel control and minimized parasitic capacitance, establishing it as a strong candidate for future nanoscale devices demanding superior variation immunity and power-performance efficiency."

    "abstract": "Coarse-grained Reconfigurable Architecture (CGRA) is a competitive accelerator architecture for computation-intensive loop kernels. Spatial CGRA is a typical CGRA that performs all the operations spatially to reduce reconfiguration costs within a single iteration, demanding high data parallelism. To achieve this goal, one of the main challenges is the loop-carried dependency between memory accesses. Many existing CGRA compilers struggle to precisely analyze the dependency distance, especially when accesses involve complex address patterns. Consequently, these compilers often default to setting the distance to one, based on a worst-case assumption, leading to degraded performance. However, we observe that a precise distance can improve performance significantly, raising the requirement for an efficient distance calculation approach. Another challenge is the performance constraints of single-bank memory, which necessitate the designer partitioning the original data into a multi-bank memory. However, we observe that the mapping result can cause the inter-iteration conflict, thereby invalidating the memory partition scheme. Therefore, an efficient post-mapping conflict detection is required. In this paper, we develop a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP)-based approach for calculating dependency distance and detecting conflicts, which determines the maximum available dependency distance and identifies conflicts within both intra- and inter-iterations. Besides, we formulate access scheduling as a graph coloring problem, which can minimize conflicts and improve performance. Overall, we develop a comprehensive end-to-end framework with architectural and compiler support for efficient data parallelism on spatial CGRA. We conduct extensive experiments to systematically evaluate the impact of different approaches on performance and compilation. Evaluation results show that our architecture can achieve 13.16× and 1.19× (up to 1.68×) average performance improvements compared to a RISC-V CPU and a state-of-the-art CGRA SoC, respectively. Besides, our architecture has 7.38× and 1.18× (up to 1.65×) average energy efficiency gains compared to these two architectures."

High computational resource consumption and the need for rapid convergence constitute major challenges in this area. To address these challenges, this study puts forward an electrical-thermal coupling algorithm. This algorithm is based on the tetrahedral spectral element time-domain (TSETD) method, and it successfully merges the high accuracy of the spectral element method (SEM) with the strong geometric adaptability of the finite element method (FEM). In the TSETD, a collapse transformation method facilitates the conversion of orthogonal basis functions from a hexahedral to a tetrahedral reference element for simplified element matrix analysis and calculation. Moreover, non-equidistant Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL) spectral interpolation nodes for tetrahedral elements are produced by this study utilizing the Warp&Blend transformation. This approach makes direct nodal numerical integration calculation possible through Vandermonde matrices, leading to faster convergence when compared with traditional Gaussian integration. For addressing both electrical and thermal fields, the algorithm incorporates time-domain solvers. Representative cases derived from modern integrated circuit test series are utilized for validation. Results from these cases confirm the method’s ability to combine high accuracy with efficiency concerning complex electrothermal coupling challenges."

It has inspired pioneering solutions for vital tasks in autonomous driving, such as dense mapping and closed-loop simulation, as well as comprehensive scene feature for driving scene understanding and reasoning. Given the rapid growth in related research, this survey provides a comprehensive review of both technical evolutions and practical applications in autonomous driving. We begin with an introduction to the preliminaries of learning-based 3D reconstruction to provide a solid technical background foundation, then progress to a rigorous, multi-dimensional examination of cutting-edge methodologies, systematically organized according to the distinctive technical requirements and fundamental challenges of autonomous driving. Through analyzing and summarizing development trends and cutting-edge research, we identify existing technical challenges, along with insufficient disclosure of on-board validation and safety verification details in the current literature, and ultimately suggest potential directions to guide future studies."

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised Referring Expression Grounding (WREG) aims at grounding the target region based on a given expression, where the mapping between regions and expressions is unknown during training. Recent WREG methods leverage the strategy of generating pseudo-labels utilizing Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) to avoid the cross-modal heterogeneous gaps arising from the two-stage reconstruction strategy. However, mainstream VLPs are trained with image-text alignment data, which makes the generated labels inapplicable to REG task. Furthermore, due to the constraints of WREG data, it is challenging to ensure the quality of the pseudo-labels. To this end, we propose a Cyclic Pseudo-label Generation and Refinement (CPGR) method to alleviate the above limitations. Specifically, we cycle through the process of Generation-Refinement-Grounding to alleviate the impact of missing region annotations. We perform REG task-adaptive fine-tuning on BLIP-2 to generate REG-style descriptions with Region-Centrality. Then, we design a Pseudo-label Refinement module by utilizing cross-modal token attention to enhance the reliability of pseudo-labels and ensure their Reference-Discrimination. Experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods. Our code and models will be released at https://github.com/5jiahe/CPGR."

    "abstract": "Although continuous-time (CT) analyzes offer valuable theoretical insights into improving robustness, they often fail to incorporate critical sampling effects and other discrete-time (DT) dynamics essential for practical implementations. Consequently, DT analyzes are required to comprehensively evaluate how various discretization approaches influence system performance and robustness in servo-drive applications. This study investigates a discrete disturbance observer (DOB) framework for servo-drive systems, examining both differentiator- and estimator-based DOB designs implemented via Euler and Tustin discretization methods. By analyzing the impact of these designs on sensitivity peaks, noise sensitivity, and disturbance rejection, the study derives design constraints for the nominal plant model and observer bandwidth using DT sensitivity analyses and the Bode integral theorem. Theoretical evaluations and experimental results consistently demonstrate that the Tustin method, particularly when applied to differentiator-based DOB, delivers better disturbance attenuation and control performance. This systematic approach not only provides practical guidelines for tuning DOB parameters, but also assists in choosing discretization techniques most suitable for optimizing practical servo drive systems in real-world applications."

    "abstract": "Fuel supply interruptions at gas-fired power plants are a leading cause of power outages during winter storms, often affecting even plants holding firm contracts. These challenges are especially acute in the Northeastern U.S., where pipeline congestion during peak heating demand restricts gas deliveries to the power sector. This paper examines the potential of Advanced Exchange Agreements, under which industrial customers transfer firm supply and transportation capacity to power plants during emergencies in exchange for compensation. We develop an optimization framework for the joint operation of gas and electricity systems during winter emergencies. The framework captures competing gas uses, contract types, and curtailment priorities, and is applied to a system representing the Northeastern U.S. during the 2014 Polar Vortex, leveraging a novel dataset on gas deliveries by sector and contract type. Our results show that the net benefits of the proposed initiative vary widely (ranging from 1.0% to 40% of baseline costs on days with unserved electric energy), based on assumptions on the share of firm contracts held by industrial customers and the subset of power plants eligible for participation in the bilateral agreements. Limiting power plant participation in the Advanced Exchange Agreements emerges as a greater barrier to realizing the potential benefits of the proposed initiative than modest firm contract holdings of industrial customers."

By adjusting the quantity and parameters of polarization transformation base matrices, three different encryption schemes are realized. For an eavesdropper without the key, the bit error rates (BERs) of the three encrypted signals are 0.495, 0.499, and 0.502, respectively, thus confirming the effectiveness of the encryption schemes. To enhance resistance to brute force attacks, a one-dimensional logistic chaotic mapping system is introduced, expanding the key space to 3.03×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">55</sup> .

    "abstract": "Objective: Accurate and continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure (BP) is essential for effective management of cardiac and hypertension-related conditions. The limitations of non-invasive measurement techniques and the insufficient accuracy of invasive methods highlight the need for novel approaches. This study introduces a machine learning-based methodology for precise and continuous BP estimation by analyzing electrocardiography (ECG) signals in sub-frequency bands. Methodology: ECG and BP recordings from five subjects, sourced from the IEEE database, were utilized. The signals were segmented into specific sub-frequency bands (e.g., 2-40 Hz, 5-15 Hz), resulting in 594 machine learning models. A 10-second epoching process was applied to the ECG signals to enhance prediction accuracy. Statistical features were extracted from the time domain, and correlation analysis was performed to identify BP-relevant features for model training. Gaussian process regression, decision tree, and ensemble bagged tree algorithms were employed to develop and evaluate the prediction models. Results: Among the tested models, the best performance was achieved using the 2-40 Hz frequency band of the 10-second epoch ECG signals, yielding mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of 1.80 for systolic BP and 1.36 for diastolic BP, with a coefficient of determination (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) of 0.99. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that analyzing ECG signals within specific frequency ranges strengthens their correlation with arterial blood pressure. Moreover, the inclusion of epoched ECG signals significantly enhances the predictive accuracy of BP estimation models, providing a promising foundation for non-invasive BP monitoring applications."

    "abstract": "Aligning a pair of cross-modality images (e.g., MR-CT, CBCT-CT) is important, yet conventional approaches, including registration or Image-to-Image (I2I) translation methods often have limitations. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a “Register by Generation (RbG)” framework, a novel 2D deep learning approach designed to generate images that are structurally well-aligned with the fixed image while preserving the detailed intensity and contrast of the moving image, which we refer to as the reference image. Our approach operates in two sequential key stages: first, we employ a novel semi-global reference-augmented image synthesis network incorporating Patch Adaptive Instance Normalization (PAdaIN). This method leverages a down-sampled reference image to guide local adaptive synthesis, generating a more accurately aligned image with a reduced risk of hallucinations. In the second stage, we introduce a detailed refining reference-augmented network featuring a Deformation-Aware Cross-Attention (DACA) block, which aims to recover finer details and textures that may be missing from the initial stage. This unique component (DACA block) enables the transfer of corresponding relevant features from the reference image, effectively performing a “copy-and-paste” operation within the latent feature space. Additionally, we propose a novel combination of loss functions that enables self-supervised training on misaligned datasets, eliminating the need for pre-aligned data. We rigorously evaluate our method on multiple misaligned datasets using metrics focused on structural alignment and distributional consistency, demonstrating comprehensively superior performance. Furthermore, we test its robustness by simulating intentional misalignments in a well-aligned dataset. Additionally, experiments from a case study and downstream segmentation tasks highlight the broad applicability of our approach."

    "abstract": "A novel control methodology for Multi-Active Bridge (MAB) converters, termed the Single PWM (SPWM) technique, aimed at reducing both conduction and switching losses, is proposed in this paper. The proposed control algorithm achieves soft switching across all load conditions while optimizing the converter's overall conduction loss by minimizing the RMS currents of the three ports for the MAB converters, particularly under light load conditions. By employing only two control variables— primary and secondary phase shifts (ɸd) and zero-voltage turn-on intervals (α or β)—the control complexity is significantly reduced compared to conventional MAB control algorithms, which rely on multiple variables and incur high computational overhead. The SPWM control method thus enables efficient and straightforward converter operation under both step-up and step-down conditions. Simulation and experimental results at a 10 kHz operating frequency and 70 kW power delivery demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves soft switching and minimizes the RMS currents of all three ports under various voltage and power conditions, leading to efficiency improvements of up to 0.6% compared to conventional SPWM techniques."

    "abstract": "Efficient power management in smart grid relies on collecting fine-grained power consumption data from users. However, these data may reveal sensitive information about individuals' habits and lifestyles. Various multidimensional data aggregation schemes leveraging public key encryption (PKE) algorithms have been proposed to address this problem. Never theless, most of these schemes come with significant performance costs. In addition, if the secret key of a smart meter was leaked, the confidentiality of encrypted user power data could be at risk. In this article, we propose a lightweight, multidimensional, and privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme with fault-tolerance and key-leakage resilience for smart grid without relying on a trusted third party (TTP), named FKLM-PDA, in which a novel data packaging method that transforms users' multidimensional data into a one-dimensional format is designed, enabling data center parse aggregated results in each dimension, reducing computation and communication costs. For better efficiency, an effective encryption algorithm is proposed to replace the expensive additive homomorphic PKE, like the Paillier cryptosystem, which combines a random masking with secret-sharing based key separation, ensuring threshold key-leakage resilience under a bounded, non-colluding leakage model. Furthermore, not only does FKLM-PDA enhance the fault tolerance mechanism of data transmission from smart meters to a corresponding fog node, but also it supports dynamic user management for joining and exiting improving scalability. Security analysis confirms that FKLM-PDA is privacy-preserving and secure while guaranteeing key-leakage resilience, fault tolerance, authentication, and data integrity. Through performance evaluations, FKLM-PDA outper forms the existing schemes and is superior in computation and functional in communication."

The A-EFIE overcomes the low-frequency breakdown problem of the electric-field integral equation (EFIE), meeting the EM simulation requirements for interconnects from DC to sub-THz frequencies. The layered medium Green's function (LMGF) is integrated into the A-EFIE formulation, extending the proposed method to the electromagnetic simulation of high-density multilayer interconnects embedded in dielectric substrates. This work proposes a novel integration of the LMGF into the A-EFIE formulation for lossy conductors, in which both exterior and interior problems are considered. By accurately characterizing conductor losses and skin effects, the proposed method is well-suited for broadband EM simulation of multilayer interconnects in advanced packaging. Compared with the FEM implementation in the HFSS software, the proposed LMGF-based method eliminates the need for meshing stratified dielectric structures in integrated circuits, achieving at least two orders of magnitude reduction in mesh elements. Numerical examples are conducted on different chip-level multilayer interconnects to validate the effectiveness and efficiencies of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Automated neonatal pain recognition and assessment based on deep learning is an emerging interdisciplinary topic that combines clinical pediatric medicine and affective computing. To improve the recognition accuracy of neonatal pain facial expressions, this paper proposes a Cross-hierarchical Multi-head Sparse Vision Transformer Network (CMS-ViT). Based on the Transformer architecture, the network presents a multi-head dynamic token sparsification fusion module, which performs dynamic feature selection and information fusion through three stages: selection, pairing, and fusion. This module sparsifies the tokens involved in computation to reduce redundancy. By inserting the sparsification module into different hierarchical layers, the network gradually reduces computational complexity. A cross-hierarchical feature fusion module is then embedded into the backbone to integrate semantic information from different depths, mitigating information loss caused by sparsification and fusion, and ultimately generating more discriminative feature representations by leveraging high-level semantic cues. In addition, the model utilizes pretrained parameters obtained via masked autoencoding on large-scale facial expression datasets, enhancing performance on the neonatal pain facial expression recognition task. Experimental results show that CMS-ViT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the Facial Expression of Neonatal Pain (FENP) dataset and demonstrates good generalization on the AffectNet and RAF-DB datasets."

    "abstract": "In-memory computing (IMC) has emerged as a promising solution for artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators due to the reduced data movement and improved parallelism in the crosspoint array. However, IMC faces several limitations such as the device variations affecting the computing accuracy, the area- and energy-consuming peripheral circuitry, and the time-consuming high-voltage program-verify operations of the nonvolatile memory (NVM). In addition, the relatively large summation currents cause IR drop within the array, leading to further loss of accuracy. To overcome these issues, this work presents 1-bit quantized networks based on spin-orbit-torque magnetoresistive random access-memory (SOT-MRAM) with high resistance–area (RA) product. We provide a detailed statistical characterization of SOT-MRAM arrays and develop quantization-aware training of various neural networks. Our results indicate that SOT-MRAM enables: 1) high inference accuracy, thanks to excellent uniformity; 2) negligible input-dependent IR drop nonlinearity, thanks to high resistance; and 3) high-speed, low-power reconfiguration, thanks to fast device programming. These results support high-RA SOT-MRAM for digital-like and reconfigurable IMC accelerators of edge AI."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a data-driven framework for policy-oriented benchmarking and catalyzation of innovation productivity across 65 U.S. metropolitan areas. The study achieves a high level of research rigor by integrating multiple complementary analytical modules and systematically validating results through robust statistical and diagnostic tests. Specifically, the methodological design synthesizes three components: (1) a Multi-Feature Selection (MFS) pipeline that combines Random Forest, Select K-Best, and Recursive Feature Elimination to ensure statistically reliable identification of innovation determinants; (2) Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) with parameterized kernel functions optimized to capture complex nonlinear interdependencies among innovation factors; and (3) a Particle Swarm Optimization-enhanced Gradient Boosting Machine (PSO-GBM) that delivers exceptional predictive accuracy (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$R^{2}$</tex-math></inline-formula> = 0.984, RMSE = 358.0) while demonstrating minimal overfitting (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$R^{2}$</tex-math></inline-formula> differential between training and testing = 0.016). Rigour is further reinforced through systematic residual analysis and comprehensive sensitivity analysis, which together provide robust validation of the framework's reliability. These diagnostics reveal significant regional disparities in innovation performance relative to model predictions, with striking counter-intuitive results. Several metropolitan areas substantially outperform expectations through strategic ecosystem alignment and policy coherence, while others exhibit considerable innovation deficits despite apparent structural advantages. Sensitivity analysis identifies STEM education infrastructure as the most influential driver of innovation, challenging conventional policy assumptions. The empirically validated framework equips engineering managers and policymakers with actionable, quantitative insights for designing targeted interventions, allocating resources effectively, and transforming underperforming regions into resilient innovation ecosystems through evidence-based strategies. <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Managerial Relevance Statement</b> This research provides engineering managers and policymakers with a robust, diagnostic tool to enhance regional innovation ecosystems. For engineering managers, the framework identifies key leverage points, such as local STEM talent pipeline strength, for making strategic decisions about corporate R&D location, university partnership formation, and long-term talent acquisition. For policymakers, the model offers a predictive capability to move beyond generic strategies, enabling the design of targeted interventions. It helps answer critical questions: Should a region prioritize R&D tax credits or STEM education funding? Our analysis provides quantitative evidence that a 50% increase in STEM degrees is associated with a 33% rise in innovation productivity, while R&D expenditure alone has a more limited impact, highlighting the need for a coordinated strategy. The framework pinpoints specific regions that are underperforming their potential, allowing for focused benchmarking and the transfer of best practices to close performance gaps. Stakeholders can leverage our framework to simulate the impact of potential interventions before committing resources, thereby optimizing public and private investment. This study also contributes to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure)."

The ultimate objective being to enhance consistency and efficiency in claims processing by leveraging LLM capabilities to understand complex legal language. The methodology involves training and testing various models on a bicycle insurance policy and hypothetical claims against the policy. Key achievements include the introduction of an agent-based approach that significantly improves the acceptability of written claims handler responses. The findings indicate that, by using a combination of agents with crafted prompts, LLMs can produce acceptable claims handler responses to claim descriptions."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an optimal design method for surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motors (SPMSMs) based on electromagnetic performance prediction using a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based regression model enhanced with attention mechanisms. Among various machine learning techniques aimed at improving design efficiency through prediction, CNNs are well-suited for performance prediction as they effectively capture spatial structures and local patterns, extracting key features from motor designs. Additionally, the integration of attention mechanisms, which we applied to the CNNs, further improves prediction performance by assigning greater weights to critical design features, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy and learning efficiency. Moreover, attention mechanisms enable the identification of relationships among features, overcoming the limitations of localized learning in conventional CNN models. In this study, the effectiveness of attention mechanisms is evaluated, and a CNN-based regression model incorporating these mechanisms is developed. The proposed regression model is then applied to optimize the design of an SPMSM."

    "abstract": "Zero-shot text-to-video diffusion models are crafted to expand pre-trained image diffusion models to the video domain without additional training. In recent times, prevailing techniques commonly rely on existing shapes as constraints and introduce inter-frame attention to ensure texture consistency. However, such shape constraints tend to restrict the stylized geometric deformation of videos and inadvertently neglect the original texture characteristics. Furthermore, existing methods suffer from flickering and inconsistent facial expressions. In this paper, we present DiffPortraitVideo. The framework employs a diffusion model-based feature and attention injection mechanism to generate key frames, with cross-frame constraints to enforce coherence and adaptive feature fusion to ensure expression consistency. Our approach achieves high spatio-temporal and expression consistency while retaining the textual and original image properties. Extensive and comprehensive experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of our proposed framework in generating personalized, high-quality, and coherent videos. This not only showcases the superiority of our method over existing approaches but also paves the way for further research and development in the field of text-to-video generation with enhanced personalization and quality."

    "abstract": "In integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems, based on sensed information such as user positions, UAV scheduling could be optimized to enhance the communication performance. However, sensing errors are inevitable, leading to a performance degradation. This paper proposes a sensing-error-aware (SEA) multi-UAV scheduling scheme (SEA-scheduling). First, the impact of the sensing errors on communication performance is analyzed, and a SEA communication rate is derived. Then, targeting to maximize this SEA rate, multi-UAV collaborative scheduling is jointly optimized with sensing resource allocation. The problem is solved by decomposing into two subproblems, i.e., a joint UAV position schedule, user association and bandwidth allocation optimization subproblem (PUB) and a sensing resource optimization subproblem (SRO), which can be solved iteratively. A generative diffusion(GD)-driven multi-agent reinforcement learning (GD-MADRL) algorithm is proposed to solve PUB, and a classical simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is adopted to solve SRO. The main idea of GD-MADRL is to introduce the GD model in MADRL to generate training data with sensing errors, enhancing the robustness of generated UAV scheduling strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that when there are sensing errors, the proposed SEA-scheduling scheme improves the communication rate by up to 30% compared to existing sensing-error-unaware schemes."

    "abstract": "The rise of 6G networks brings ultra-fast communication and broad connectivity, enabling intelligent applications such as IoT, smart cities, and autonomous vehicles. However, training AI models in these environments often faces privacy concerns and limited labeled data. Federated Learning (FL) provides a privacy-preserving solution by allowing clients to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. Yet, FL still struggles with the scarcity of labeled data due to privacy constraints. Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) can alleviate this issue by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data. While combining SSL and FL (FSSL) offers promise, it also introduces new challenges, such as confirmation bias and degraded performance under non-IID data distributions. Most existing FSSL methods assume uniform labeling capabilities across clients, which is rarely the case in practice. This leads to a new challenge only occur in FSSL called annotation heterogeneity, where some clients have many labeled samples while others have few or none. When combined with data heterogeneity, this dual-data heterogeneity (data and annotation heterogeneity) severely affects global model performance. Therefore, FSSL must learn under label scarcity while preserving privacy, remain stable when non-IID data is compounded by annotation heterogeneity, and stay communication-efficient for mobile deployment. In this work, we propose Federated Fisher Focus Filtering (FedF3), an enhanced framework built upon our previous SynFMPL method, to address the combination effect of dual-data heterogeneity. FedF3 introduces a two-stage strategy, Adaptive Loss Filtering stabilizes early training by suppressing unreliable contributions under dual heterogeneity, and Fisher Focus Selection preserves accuracy with Fisher-guided sparsity to meet communication budgets. Our method demonstrates robust performance improvements across diverse and heterogeneous FL settings, mitigating the negative effects of dual-data heterogeneity while preserving personalization and privacy."

    "abstract": "In narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) networks, latency reduction is a significant issue especially regarding IoT applications with strict latency requirements. The signalling overhead constitutes the major factor of latency increase. 3GPP made several attempts to decrease the signalling overhead for massive machine type communications (mMTC) in NB-IoT networks. Among that attempts, early data transmission (EDT) is one of the latest efforts that reduces the signalling overhead by allowing data transmission without a connection establishment. Although EDT can support the transmission of multiple data packets besides one, it cannot deal with the randomness of data packet arrivals at buffered IoT devices. In this work, a new data transmission scheme is proposed that reduces signalling overhead by employing piggybacking. Specifically, the proposed scheme concerns buffered IoT devices, which transmit the first data packet of the buffer by participating in the contention-based random access (RA) and the following data packets on the reserved data channels without taking part in RA again, according to the proposed scheme. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is evaluated with simulation experiments versus the number of IoT devices and mean interarrival time of data packets at each IoT device. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme reduces dropped packets, service delay and enhances throughput."

    "abstract": "Behavioral forgetting is a key cognitive function that adaptively suppresses outdated action policies. Despite its importance, its implementation within AI avatars for metaverse environments remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the difficulty of integrating flexible memory control into existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) frameworks and the practical constraints of real-time deployment. To address this gap, we introduce Forgetting-Enabled Avatar Control (FEAC), a dual-model architecture that integrates a large language model (LLM)-based memory evaluator with a policy network based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). In FEAC, forgetting decisions are made via in-context learning and implemented through an adaptive observation gating mechanism. We evaluate FEAC in a virtual warehouse exploration task across nine forgetting regimes over 5×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">6</sup> steps. The results reveal a U-shaped trade-off where moderate forgetting achieves an optimal balance between exploration efficiency and behavioral stability. Furthermore, comparative analysis demonstrates that FEAC outperforms a heuristic rule-based baseline by 17% in optimal regimes and maintains robust performance even under aggressive suppression schedules. Additionally, FEAC reduces redundant revisits, stabilizes reaction times, and maintains compact, goal-directed trajectories. These outcomes demonstrate that neuroscience-inspired forgetting mechanisms can enhance avatar efficiency and adaptability, charting a path toward broader metaverse applications such as virtual training and navigation."

Closed-form expressions for the secrecy capacity (SC) and secrecy outage probability (SOP) are derived and validated through Monte-Carlo simulations. The proposed analytical framework explicitly accounts for the joint effects of non-ideal hardware (NIH), imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC), and imperfect channel state information (CSI), thereby providing a realistic evaluation of secrecy in IoT networks. Numerical results reveal that NIH has a negligible impact on the secrecy of the common message but significantly degrades the secrecy of private messages at high transmit powers. Moreover, both NIH and imperfect SIC introduce non-vanishing SOP error floors, while imperfect CSI at the eavesdropper can substantially enhance secrecy. The number of transmit antennas and the operating frequency are also shown to critically influence secrecy performance. Overall, the findings highlight that HIS-RSMA is a promising solution for secure and efficient transmission in IoT networks, underscoring the need for joint optimization of transceiver design, antenna configuration, and physical-layer security strategies in beyond fifth-generation (B5G) wireless systems."

To evaluate their equalization capability, C+L-band recirculating transmission experiments were conducted with spectral equalization performed solely by the LLVSEs in the recirculating loop. Net bitrates exceeded 1 Tbps per channel for transmission distances up to 1120 km, and total net bitrates of 74.9, 67.0, and 59.2 Tbps were achieved after 640-, 1120-, and 1600-km transmission, respectively.

To better address these issues, we propose a Multimodal Road Crack Segmentation Network–TMENet, based on complex scenes. In this article, we introduced text guidance in road crack segmentation tasks to supplement more detailed crack features. Firstly, we designed the Textual Crack Enhancer module(TCE Module) to fine-tune the Text Transformer in the Clipseg model to enhance its ability to parse specific crack descriptions. Secondly, we designed a multiscale Mamba module(Ms-Mamba Module) that integrates multiscale composite convolution and residual connections to improve the sensitivity of the model to local and multiscale details and enhance the network’s ability to recover lost features. Then, we designed a Laplacian edge detection module (LED module) that combines deep visual features and high-frequency edge information to enhance the crack edge detection capability in complex scenes through a refined feature adjustment mechanism. Finally, TMENet achieved the best results in comparative testing with seven state-of-the-art segmentation networks on the CampCrack800, AsphaltCrack300, Crackseg9K, and CRKWH100 datasets. In addition, TMENet has achieved excellent results in actual road testing, and the test results show that TMENet is an effective auxiliary method to improve the accuracy of road safety detection."

    "abstract": "Intent-Based Networking (IBN) often leverages the programmability of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to simplify network management. However, significant challenges remain in automating the entire pipeline, from user-specified high-level intents to device-specific low-level configurations. Existing solutions often rely on rigid, rule-based translators and fixed APIs, limiting extensibility and adaptability. By contrast, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer a promising pathway that leverages natural language understanding and flexible reasoning. However, it is unclear to what extent LLMs can perform IBN tasks. To address this, we introduce IBNBench, a first-of-its-kind benchmarking suite comprising eight datasets: Intent2Flow-ODL, Intent2Flow-ONOS, Intent2Flow-Ryu, Intent2Flow-Floodlight, FlowConflict-ODL, FlowConflict-ONOS, FlowConflict-Ryu, and FlowConflict-Floodlight. These datasets are specifically designed for evaluating LLMs performance in intent translation and conflict detection tasks within the industry-grade and research-focused SDN controllers such as ODL, ONOS, Ryu, and Floodlight. Our results provide the first comprehensive comparison of 33 open-source LLMs on IBNBench and related datasets, revealing a wide range of performance outcomes. However, while these results demonstrate the potential of LLMs for isolated IBN tasks, integrating LLMs into a fully autonomous IBN pipeline remains unexplored. Thus, our second contribution is NetIntent, a unified and adaptable framework that leverages LLMs to automate the full IBN lifecycle, including translation, activation, and assurance within SDN systems. NetIntent orchestrates both LLM and non-LLM agents, supporting dynamic re-prompting and contextual feedback to robustly execute user-defined intents with minimal human intervention. Our implementation of NetIntent across ODL, ONOS, Ryu, and Floodlight achieves a consistent and adaptive end-to-end IBN realization."

As a result, the adaptability of UAVs to unknown environments is improved, enhancing the success rate of planning and ensuring safety. Specifically, a probabilistic cost-weighted kinodynamic search method is proposed, which computes trajectory costs using probabilistic weights. On the basis, different penalty weights are assigned for traveling in free and unknown spaces, ensuring that paths are prioritized to be found from free space. Additionally, an obstacle uncertainty-aware planning method is leveraged to actively avoid potential obstacles in unknown space, reducing the flight risk caused by obstacle uncertainty.

This paper aims to optimize UAVs' trajectories, pricing strategies and users' offloading decisions, enabling UAVs to move to suitable locations and provide computing offloading services at appropriate prices, thereby reducing delay and energy, and enhancing the utilities of both UAV and users. The user utility specifically consist of throughput, energy consumption, delay penalties, and expenditures on purchasing computing resources. The UAV's utility consists of computing energy consumption, delay penalties, and revenue from selling computing resources as incentives. We formulate the pre-offloading problem to solve users' offloading selection, and transform the problem into a multi-user non-cooperative game using game theory while proving the existence of Nash equilibrium. Then we model the interaction between UAV and users using Stackelberg game model and prove the existence of Stackelberg equilibrium. We use multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) and propose DRL and Game Theory-based Trajectory Optimization and Task Offloading (DGTT) algorithm to solve UAVs' trajectories and obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium solution. We sequentially solve for the pricing strategy and offloading decisions, thereby obtaining the optimized utilities of both UAV and users. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to verify the feasibility of DGTT algorithm, along with comparative experiments that demonstrate our proposed DGTT algorithm's excellent performance in optimizing UAV and user utilities, while reducing system energy consumption and delay."

    "abstract": "Modern neural networks have undergone extensive hardware optimization to address the increasing computational demands. While most existing acceleration strategies concentrate on linear operations, the relative cost of these nonlinear operations has become a critical efficiency bottleneck. This work presents QUNF+, a hardware-centric, quadratic-based approximation framework that offers a universal, scalable, and accurate approach for accelerating a wide range of nonlinear functions. Unlike conventional piecewise linear methods, QUNF+ segments functions uniformly and applies second-order Taylor expansions, yielding superior accuracy with fewer segments. QUNF+ also introduces a hardware-efficient approximation scheme with adjustable precision and an optional remainder compensation mechanism. In addition, we propose a set of novel function remapping techniques further reducing approximation error with minimal overhead. We design a fully integrated hardware architecture incorporating Canonical Signed Digit encoding and logic pruning to minimize resource usage without accuracy loss. Experimental results demonstrate that QUNF+ achieves up to 4.1x, 1.5x and 1.7x improvements in power, area, and latency, respectively, over state-of-the-art PWL methods. Application to real-world Transformer models results in an accuracy degradation of less than 0.72% and 0.10% on NLP and CV tasks, with system-level evaluations showing up to 24.38% reduction in total energy consumption and 92.39% in nonlinear operation energy. These results establish QUNF+ as a robust and scalable solution for nonlinear acceleration in modern AI hardware."

To imitate an industrial silicon photonics chip, we fabricated a sample with a similar geometry that incorporated V-groove alignment features for fiber coupling. Two reliability tests, the tensile cycling test (TCT) and the side tensile cycling test (STCT), were performed to accelerate sample failure and generate fatigue failure data. Both tests revealed the same failure mode, which is characterized by the appearance of slow intensity cycles in the insertion loss due to a growing gap between optical fibers and the adhesive at the joint, resulting from fiber displacement during tensile cycles after strain relief (SR) failure. The power law model (PM) was applied to the collected fatigue data for both reliability tests. The PM revealed that both tests shared a common failure mechanism, involving minor delaminations between the ribbon coating and the SR adhesive. Notably, the PM exponents from STCT (0.80 ± 0.02) and low-load TCT (0.812 ± 0.002) suggest a similar mechanism, while high-load TCT showed a distinct mechanism (2.324 ± 0.001), characterized by adhesive residues dragged by the ribbon after breakage due to high loads."

    "abstract": "Existing speech steganalysis suffers from generalization in dynamic scenarios such as unknown or random Embedding Strengths (EBS). The central challenge is domain mismatch, a problem that remains largely unexplored in speech steganalysis. To fill the gap, this letter proposes a novel multi-source domain adaptation method called Fuzzy Clustering-Based Domain Adaptation (FCDA). First, to enable effective clustering of samples with similar actual EBS, FCDA employs Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering, allowing soft estimation across multiple Embedding Rate (EBR) levels. Second, to enhance the steganographic classification performance, we construct the backbone network integrating a dual-primary classifier with an auxiliary EBR hierarchy classifier, which leverages the strength-sensitive representation. Third, to better realize the training of multi-objective tasks and enhance feature discriminability, the domain-consistent optimization loss is introduced. Experimental results show that FCDA outperforms state-of-the-art steganalysis methods and multi-source domain adaptation methods."

    "abstract": "Vertical federated learning (VFL) has made significant strides in enhancing data privacy and security for cross-silo applications. However, despite its benefits, VFL remains vulnerable to emerging security threats, particularly backdoor attacks. While most existing research on VFL backdoor attacks has focused on image and natural language processing tasks, the security of tabular data—commonly used in high-risk domains such as finance and healthcare—has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we introduce chamaeleon, a novel backdoor attack targeting VFL for tabular data. Our approach achieves two key advancements. First, to address the challenge of restricted label access in VFL, chamaeleon employs a two-step inference method to extract label information. This method combines a label classifier with a top-<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i> confidence filtering mechanism, enabling the precise identification of target-label samples (i.e., backdoored samples) with a precision of approximately 99.85%. Second, to overcome the limitations of fixed trigger patterns, which can disrupt the semantic integrity of tabular data (e.g., altering “male” to “pregnant”), chamaeleon introduces a dynamic trigger design. Each backdoored sample is injected with a unique trigger, generated by a transformer-based model inspired by large language models, ensuring semantic consistency. Additionally, a one-on-two adversarial game is implemented to optimize the generator’s performance with limited training data. Extensive evaluations across six models and six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack. We also examine various factors that could influence the attack success and systematically analyze potential defense mechanisms to mitigate this newly identified threat."

    "abstract": "Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are a critical infrastructure for modern society. More than half of their large electricity demand is used by aeration systems, which regulate the fundamental biochemical processes that purify the water. The slow dynamics of these reactions allow aeration intensity to be flexibly adjusted over short periods with minimal effects on water treatment quality. Leveraging this operational flexibility to counterbalance renewable energy variability presents a large untapped opportunity. Although grid operators offer financial incentives for flexible consumers who can adjust power consumption in response to grid imbalances, prequalifying assets for such programs requires precise quantification of their power and energy flexibility. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to quantify the flexibility of aeration systems in WWTPs. For power flexibility, we conduct a statistical analysis of real-world WWTP data. For energy flexibility, we propose a modified gradient boosting model using decision trees, trained on historical measurements and using future inputs to predict system dynamics. Our approach achieves biological oxygen demand (BOD) prediction errors of 0.18–0.37 mg/L, compared to a measured average of 3.85 mg/L. We show that for short activations the BOD limit is only exceeded in 2% of cases, demonstrating the feasibility of unlocking WWTP flexibility for grid services, contributing to the cost-effective mass integration of renewable energy."

The results demonstrate that the fiber supports 11 spin-orbit alignment/anti-alignment modes, with adjacent modes exhibiting an effective refractive index difference (Δn<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">eff</sub>) exceeding 2.03×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup> at 1550 nm and surpassing 1.98×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup> across the 1530 - 1650 nm.

When increasing the number of propagated Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (WDM) channels from 6 to 17, HAs experience critical transient and steady-state power excursions. The effective adaptation and application of the link-control technique allow us to reduce these power excursions from 4.61 dB to 0.73 dB and from 4.07 dB to 0.14 dB for transient and steady-state regimes, respectively. This technique proved to be simple and effective, presenting a high potential to be tested in other wavelength bands."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of multi-omics data has provided new opportunities for cancer subtype classification. Due to the ability to model gene associations by constructing graph among genes, multi-omics cancer classification based on graphs has attracted considerable attention from researchers. However, due to the high-dimensional nature of multi-omics data, existing graph construction methods based on cosine similarity may lead to noise and low-quality edges. Moreover, considering the complexity of associations within and across omics, existing methods either focus solely on multi-omics fusion at the graph structure level or only consider multi-omics fusion at the representation level, making it challenging to comprehensively model this complex relationship. To this end, we propose a novel multi-omics integration method that combines graph-level structure fusion and locus-level feature fusion to enhance the performance of cancer subtype classification (GL-Fusion). In the graph-level structure fusion module, we integrate multi-omics gene-gene graphs using similarity network fusion method and optimize the graph structure with structural entropy and the protein-protein interaction network. In the locus-level feature fusion module, we employ a locus-level graph convolutional network to integrate multi-omics features, learn gene-level fused representations, and predict cancer subtypes. Empirical validation across four publicly accessible datasets (BRCA, HNSC, LGG, THCA) indicated that our method achieved superior performance compared to 12 representative multi-omics cancer subtyping methods. Ablation experiments, experiments with different omics combinations, and evaluation experiments on modeling associations within and across omics were used to further validate the effectiveness of the method.

    "abstract": "Reliable gait recognition under low-light conditions remains challenging for traditional cameras. Event cameras, with their high dynamic range and fine temporal resolution, offer a promising alternative but suffer from sparse signals under small motion amplitudes and vulnerability to noise or irrelevant movements (e.g., shadows). To address these issues, we propose FusionGait, a complementary fusion framework that integrates event with standard frames to achieve robust gait recognition. Specifically, we propose a Self-supervised Hierarchical Feature Extractor (SSL-HFE) built upon DINOv2, which employs learnable prompts to bridge the gap between gray frames and RGB frames, extracts multi-level semantic features, and enhances their discriminability through a self-supervised learning strategy. Then, we introduce the Complementary Fusion Learning Module (CFLM), which employs cross-cost volumes to explicitly model pixel-level correlations between frames and events, enabling effective cross-modal interaction and fusion. Furthermore, we propose EvGSimulator, a sensor-specific data augmentation strategy that simulates diverse illumination conditions based on physical properties. The framework maintains robustness even when real frames are unavailable by reconstructing frame-like representations from events, and it scales to ultra–high-frame-rate scenarios with hundreds of frames per second. We also collect DAVIS346-Gait-RGE, the multi-view semi-indoor & outdoor gait dataset captured with a DAVIS346 event camera, including three modalities: event streams, gray frames, and reconstructed frames. Experiments across multiple datasets show FusionGait achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively surpassing single-modality methods."

    "abstract": "Power conversion devices are widely used in aerospace, defense, modern industry, and transportation, etc., and their reliability is critical to the stable operation of high-power supply systems. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, deep learning techniques have been increasingly applied to anomaly detection in power conversion devices due to their high detection efficiency. However, conventional approaches often fail to fully capture the spatiotemporal cascade features of increasingly complex systems, thereby limiting the effectiveness of feature extraction. To address this limitation, this article proposes a spatiotemporal cascade representation (STCR) model that enhances anomaly detection accuracy by jointly learning temporal and spatial features, as well as local and global dependencies. In the temporal domain, a self-attention mechanism is employed to model global dependencies, while local temporal information is extracted using a sliding-window approach. In the spatial domain, a spatial feature fusion matrix is designed to capture and integrate cross-component information. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the stability and effectiveness of the proposed STCR framework. Finally, experimental validation on a three-phase inverter system shows that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, achieving at least a 4% improvement in fault detection rate."

Experimental validation using a 2×1 MISO testbed over 2-meter indoor links with 16-QAM and 64-QAM OFDM demonstrates enhanced performance, achieving BER below <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$10^{-3}$</tex-math></inline-formula> under varying LED-luminaire operating conditions while conventional methods fail to meet this threshold.

    "abstract": "Real-time autonomous control of decentralized drone swarms in dynamic and cluttered environments remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a natural language-driven framework that integrates a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) with distributed model predictive control (MPC) to enable scalable and responsive UAV swarm autonomy. The system architecture comprises a ground control unit, an intelligent mission planning agent, and a decentralized swarm of drones. Mission objectives and target coordinates supplied by external sources (e.g., satellites, command center or airborne platforms), are processed by fine-tuned Phi-2 LLM trained on over 200,000 command variations. The LLM interprets these natural language inputs into structured mission plans, including drone assignments, formations, and operational modes (e.g., swarm-based, multi-target, or single-agent deployments). These plans are dispatched via the Agent mission allocator to the UAVs, each of which leverages a local MPC controller to execute its assigned task. The controllers dynamically optimize flight trajectories while ensuring collision avoidance, formation maintenance, and seamless role transitions. The framework is validated in a high-fidelity simulation environment that combines the ROTORS quadrotor dynamics simulator with Unreal Engine’s photorealistic and depth-aware rendering, facilitating vision-based navigation in cluttered environments. Experimental results demonstrate high mission success rates, accurate formation tracking, and robust adaptability to mid-mission updates, affirming the potential of combining LLM-driven intent parsing with decentralized MPC for intuitive, safe, and scalable swarm control. Future work will focus on extending this framework to physical UAV platforms for real-world deployment."

    "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is pivotal in shipping management, maritime activity monitoring, and military intelligence. However, existing target detection methods often perform poorly in SAR scenarios due to complex background environments, multi-scale target variations, speckle noise in images, and occlusions. In order to tackle these challenges, we present a detection model named OMAP2-YOLO. First, we boost feature extraction efficiency through reparameterization of the backbone network with OREPA,based on the YOLOv8 architecture. Next, we introduce the MultiSEAM module, which integrates various attention mechanisms to mitigate the interference of complex backgrounds and occlusions on target detection. We then design the QFE module to build a more refined feature pyramid. This module enables the model to effectively detect targets at multiple scales and enhances detection performance by utilizing fine-grained features from the P2 layer. Finally, we propose the Focaler_SIoU loss function, which offers improved convergence and enhances sensitivity to small targets. Extensive experiments on the HRSID and SSDD datasets demonstrate the exceptional robustness and reliability of the OMAP2-YOLO model.Compared to baseline methods, the proposed model achieves notable performance improvements on both the HRSID and SSDD datasets. On the HRSID dataset, it improves Detection Rate (DR) by 3%, F1-Score (F1) by 2%, and Average Precision (AP) by 3.1%, while reducing False Alarm Rate (FAR) by 0.2213. On the SSDD dataset, it achieves improvements of 6% in DR, 11% in F1, and 8.5% in AP. These advancements underscore the potential of OMAP2-YOLO for real-time maritime surveillance and management."

However, the analytical intractability of exact distance distributions often hinders closed-form performance evaluations and obscures parameter-performance relationships. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a low-complexity polynomial substitute for inter-point distance distributions and a systematic framework for parameter mapping. The framework employs two complementary mapping schemes, Relative Entropy Minimization (REM) which promotes fidelity to the original distribution in the Kullback-Leibler sense, and Mean Square Error Minimization (MSEM) which minimizes the mean squared error between the two distributions. These mappings yield parameter correspondences between the original and substitute distributions, enabling efficient and accurate approximations. The substitutes are validated on representative spatial models, preserving fidelity to the original distributions while using a low-complexity polynomial representation. This advancement facilitates closed-form evaluations and optimizations in random networks, enhancing the analytical toolkit for stochastic geometry and control theory."

    "abstract": "Robotic soft tissue manipulation in surgery presents significant challenges due to the tissue’s high deformability and the spatial constraints of the surgical environment. While data-driven methods for affordance estimation are common, they often face challenges with data requirements and generalization in surgical scenarios. To address these challenges, a novel framework is proposed that combines a deformation model-based shape controller with an analytical affordance estimation approach for multi-contact scenarios by employing a manipulability metric. The method leverages the deformation Jacobian matrix derived from a linearized deformation model to evaluate the manipulability of candidate multi-contact points, providing a robust and data-efficient solution. For tissue manipulation, a differentiable deformation model is employed to efficiently compute forward and backward deformation processes in real-time. Point-based visual features are constructed to represent and track the tissue deformation, enabling precise control through visual feedback. The proposed framework has been validated through simulations and physical experiments. These results demonstrate the real-time (∼ 60Hz) ability to achieve targeted configuration with high accuracy (< 1mm RMSE for each marker position) and a strong correlation (near-zero p-value) between the predicted affordance and the observed manipulation efficiency, confirming the effectiveness of our approach in soft tissue manipulation and affordance estimation."

Despite these advancements, many existing designs of soft hands still lack effective in-hand vision and the ability for each finger to achieve active multi-degree-of-freedom motion. This paper proposes a cable-driven soft robotic hand that can achieve dexterous grasping and manipulation, vision-guided grasping, vision-based slip detection and compensation, as well as visually servoed in-hand manipulation. The hand has five soft fingers, each capable of independent flexion/extension motion and bidirectional ad/abduction motion. A red-green-blue-depth (RGB-D) camera is integrated into the palm of the soft hand to enable in-hand vision capability. Modeling of the soft hand is established to analyze its kinematics, statics, and manipulability. A series of experiments are conducted to demonstrate its dexterous grasping and manipulation capabilities on a variety of objects. Using 3D point cloud data from the in-palm camera, an effective vision-guided grasping strategy is developed to grasp objects on a table. The in-hand vision also enables slip detection and compensation during grasping to maintain the grasp stability. Furthermore, a hierarchical, visually servoed controller is developed to perform closed-loop in-hand object manipulation. With its high dexterity and visual feedback capabilities, the soft hand will find important applications such as household object manipulation and food picking/sorting, and may also be used as a prosthetic hand or an auxiliary hand for humans."

    "abstract": "Graph transformer networks have received more attention in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, they overlooked the influence of graph connectivity strength in positional encoding and distribution. In order to address the above deficiencies, we proposed the novel graph transformer with structural embedding and training (GTSET) for HSI classification. Specifically, the structural embedding module firstly aimed at extracting effectively local and non-local feature information via patch-based distance encoding and centrality correlation coefficients based on graph connectivity strength, alleviating spectral variability. Secondly, the structural training module aimed at addressing imbalanced structural position distribution of labeled samples by leveraging the topological graph connectivity to determine their structural position distribution and reweighting the influence of labeled samples on the graph transformer training stage, exploring the guiding role of labeled samples in low spatial resolution of HSI. Next, we further refine training weights based on the spectral feature smoothness of labeled samples. Finally, comprehensive experiments on three real-world HSI datasets demonstrate that the GTSET achieves superior performance in HSI classification with limited labeled samples, compared to other popular classification methods. Implementation of GTSET, along with examples, can be found on the GitHub repository: https://github.com/xuchengchao0/GTSET."

    "abstract": "The Internet of Drones (IoD) is increasingly adopted in mission-critical applications, but it remains vulnerable to a wide range of cyberattacks due to its open communication channels and resource-constrained nodes. Existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) often neglect class imbalance and computational limitations, resulting in poor generalization and impractical deployment. This study aims to develop an efficient and deployable IDS framework for the IoD by addressing two key challenges: (i) the severe class imbalance in real-world traffic datasets, and (ii) the high computational complexity of Deep Learning (DL)-based models. We propose a two-phase methodology. In Phase 1, validated undersampling strategies are applied to rebalance the CIC-IoT2023 dataset, after which baseline classifiers are trained to assess detection performance. In Phase 2, the best-performing models serve as teacher networks in a multi-teacher knowledge distillation (MTKD) framework—implemented with average-weighted and confidence-weighted variants—to train lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) student models of varying capacities. These students are optimized for deployment on resource-constrained IoD edge devices. Effectiveness is assessed using both classification and computational efficiency metrics. Results show that Instance Hardness Threshold undersampling consistently outperformed Random Under Sampler across all baseline models, enhancing detection of minority attack classes. The best-performing models—LSTM and XGBoost—were selected as teachers for MTKD. Applying average-weighted and confidence-weighted MTKD to MLP1x8 increased accuracy by 0.03% and 0.09%, respectively, while confidence-weighted also reduced inference time by 0.0006 s. These gains were achieved without increasing the computational footprint, as the model retained its minimal size (0.0039 MB) and low parameter count (448). The proposed two-phase framework provides a practical solution for building lightweight and accurate IDS models suitable for real-time deployment in resource-constrained drone environments."

    "abstract": "Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) enhance global accessibility by supporting Unicode characters in web addresses. However, this capability introduces new security vulnerabilities, particularly through homoglyphs—visually similar characters such as the Cyrillic ‘’ (U+0435) and the Latin ‘e’ (U+0065)—which enable attackers to craft deceptive domain names. These IDN homograph exploits are increasingly used in phishing attacks, creating URLs that are visually indistinguishable from legitimate sites. As the adoption of IDNs continues across browsers and domain registries, the risk of such exploits grows. According to the IDC 2023 Global DNS Threat Report, 90% of organizations faced domain-based attacks, with average losses of $1.1 million per incident. In this study, we propose a web protection model for the real-time detection and mitigation of IDN homograph threats. Central to our model is the construction of Unisimchar, a dynamic homoglyph database that extends prior work by incorporating Unicode block-level structures and performing pixel-level similarity analysis using 32×32 glyph images. Unlike static or manually maintained lists, Unisimchar enables automated and scalable identification of confusable character pairs through a threshold-based visual matching algorithm. The model processes over 1 million domain names sourced from Majestic Million, Zone Files, and Daily Domains, revealing that 80% of homoglyph pairs occur within high-traffic domains worldwide, with regional concentrations observed in Pakistan and Europe. With a multithreaded architecture, the model achieves domain-level detection within 0.07 seconds, making it suitable for real-time threat prevention. The comprehensive evaluation includes a human perception study to validate visual similarity thresholds and quantitative experiments using standard metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. The results demonstrate that our model significantly improves the accuracy of homoglyph detection compared to existing methods, offering a practical and extensible defense mechanism against modern IDN homograph exploits in the web ecosystem."

    "abstract": "Packet sampling is crucial for managing datacenter networks, serving fault diagnosis, traffic measurement, and intrusion detection functions. However, traditional sampling techniques, such as those based on sketches or ports, either lack packet–level granularity or provide insufficient visibility, leading to functional performance degradation. Recent research has employed the software-defined networking (SDN) model to enable flow-based packet sampling. However, these approaches often introduce substantial control and computation overhead, limiting their scalability. This paper presents Viper, a novel priority-based, high-visibility per-flow packet sampling mechanism tailored to address these challenges. Specifically, Viper leverages existing priority-based traffic scheduling mechanisms to prioritize shorter flows over longer ones. Then, a logical centralized controller orchestrates sampling policies for packets of different priorities. In-depth analysis indicates that the orchestration performed by the controller significantly impacts Viper’s performance. Consequently, we model this process as a nonlinear optimization problem, seeking to maximize the utility of sampling. Then, we propose an online primal–dual interior–point algorithm to address this optimization problem and prove the algorithm’s convergence, optimality, and efficiency. Experimental results show that Viper increases visibility by 3.83% to 8.3%, with negligible control overhead and a substantial reduction in sampling load by at least 20.51%."

However, in real-world settings, AI systems may experience performance degradation over time, due to factors such as shifting data distributions, changes in patient characteristics, evolving clinical protocols, and variations in data quality. These factors can compromise model reliability, posing safety concerns and increasing the likelihood of inaccurate predictions or adverse outcomes. This review presents a forward-looking perspective on monitoring and maintaining the “health” of AI systems in healthcare. We highlight the urgent need for continuous performance monitoring, early degradation detection, and effective self-correction mechanisms. The paper begins by reviewing common causes of performance degradation at both data and model levels. We then summarize key techniques for detecting data and model drift, followed by an in-depth look at root cause analysis. Correction strategies are further reviewed, ranging from model retraining to test-time adaptation. Our survey spans both traditional machine learning models and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), offering insights into their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss ongoing technical challenges and propose future research directions.

However, attackers have increasingly developed attack methods that induce these models to generate harmful content, raising serious concerns about their safety and robustness. Existing attack methods mostly use single-agent strategies and therefore do not capture the synergistic nature of real-world attacks, where attackers coordinate to hide malicious intent and make detection harder. In this paper, we propose CamouflageAttack, a multi-agent attack framework that jointly improves attack and camouflage effectiveness through synergistic adversarial prompting. Specifically, CamouflageAttack mimics real-world synergistic attack behaviors by coordinating the strategy, camouflage and action agents to generate prompts that evade detection while reliably inducing targeted model responses. The strategy agent proposes candidate prompts to maximize attack success, the camouflage agent refines these prompts to enhance linguistic naturalness and the action agent applies the finalized prompt to execute the attack. Extensive experiments in both offline settings and real-world applications show that CamouflageAttack consistently achieves higher attack success rates and stronger camouflage effectiveness than existing methods.

    "abstract": "Traditional quantitative genetics rely on known pedigrees for estimating polygenic breeding values and variance components. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing, estimation of empirical relationships between individuals have become feasible. The single-step genomic BLUP procedure integrates polygenic and genomic information but requires intricate pedigree connections, leading to computationally demanding matrix operations. Here, we propose DYpREG, a flexible proximal operator multi-objective regularization method. DYpREG is a splitting algorithm that accommodates two distinct loss functions and a regularization function that can be chosen as LASSO, ridge regression (RR) or elastic net (EN). Notably, it incorporates pre-calculated breeding values without the need for extensive relationship matrix computations. Evaluated on two traits with different heritabilities from mice and pig, DYpREG with RR regularizer showed the best predictive performance compared to DYpREG with LASSO and EN regularizers as well as to all methods lacking polygenic information. The mean squared error (MSE) reduction was notable for both mice traits (1.5% and 24.77%) and both pig traits (2.8% and 2.1%). Comparative analyses with Bayesian reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and spike-and-slab (BayesC) regression also revealed consistent improvements. Hence, DYpREG effectively integrates polygenic information, enhancing prediction accuracy in genomic evaluations."

Unlike conventional offline 3D detectors that remain fixed during inference, TTC enables immediate online error correction without retraining, allowing autonomous vehicles to adapt to new scenarios and reduce deployment risks. To achieve this, we equip existing 3D detectors with an Online Adapter (OA) module-a prompt-driven query generator for real-time correction. At the core of OA module are visual prompts: image-based descriptions of objects of interest derived from auxiliary feedback such as mismatches with 2D detections, road descriptions, or user clicks. These visual prompts, collected from risky objects during inference, are maintained in a visual prompt buffer to enable continuous correction in future frames. By leveraging this mechanism, TTC consistently detects risky objects, achieving reliable, adaptive, and versatile driving autonomy. Extensive experiments show that TTC significantly improves instant error rectification over frozen 3D detectors, even under limited labels, zero-shot settings, and adverse conditions. We hope this work inspires future research on post-deployment online rectification systems for autonomous driving."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design, implementation, and experimental validation of a multi-section waveguide-based receiver protector developed for front end protection of high sensitivity microwave receivers. The structure exhibits a low insertion loss of 0.9 dB under low-power conditions, ensuring minimal signal degradation. The limiter also provides over 50 dB of attenuation by activating a diode element embedded in the waveguide. The attenuation level is also controllable via the applied bias voltage, supporting sensitivity-time-control (STC) functionality. The diode is mounted beneath a vertically aligned thin rod, and its mechanical position is adjustable. This enables frequency tuning between 2.7 GHz and 3.5 GHz, providing a tunable bandwidth of up to 800 MHz. At the tuned center frequency, the device achieves isolation exceeding 50 dB, while the bandwidth over which the isolation remains above 30 dB exceeds 200 MHz. High-power pulse tests with incident power up to 2.4 kW confirmed isolation above 30 dB, demonstrating the limiter’s robustness and effectiveness in protecting microwave receiver front-ends under severe electromagnetic conditions. Unlike prior works that report these capabilities in isolation, this study demonstrates their integration within a single S-band waveguide PIN-diode limiter, delivering low loss, wideband isolation, tunability, STC capability, and kW-class robustness simultaneously."

    "abstract": "Hand-held light field (LF) cameras often exhibit low spatial resolution due to the inherent trade-off between spatial and angular dimensions. Existing supervised learning-based LF spatial super-resolution (SR) methods, which rely on pre-defined image degradation models, struggle to overcome the domain gap between the training phase—where LFs with natural resolution are used as ground truth—and the inference phase, which aims to reconstruct higher-resolution LFs, especially when applied to real-world data. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel self-supervised learning-based method for LF spatial SR, which can produce higher spatial resolution LF images than originally captured ones without pre-defined image degradation models. The self-supervised method incorporates a hybrid LF imaging prototype, a real-world hybrid LF dataset, and a self-supervised LF spatial SR framework. The prototype makes reference image pairs between low-resolution central-view sub-aperture images and high-resolution (HR) images. The self-supervised framework consists of a well-designed LF spatial SR network with hybrid input, a central-view synthesis network with an HR-aware loss that enables side-view sub-aperture images to learn high-frequency information from the only HR central view reference image, and a backward degradation network with an epipolar-plane image gradient loss to preserve LF parallax structures. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art ones in reconstructing higher spatial resolution LF images without pre-defined degradation.

This study addresses the integrated AGV positioning and scheduling problem (AGV-PSP) under uncertainty through a novel framework integrating reinforcement learning (RL), combinatorial optimization, and high-fidelity simulation. We formulate the AGV-PSP as a Markov Decision Process where RL learns the state value function, estimating the long-term operational value of terminal locations. Based on the value function, our positioning policy strategically locates AGVs in high-value areas, while our scheduling policy balances immediate and long-term rewards using integer linear programming solved by an improved Hungarian algorithm. Experiments demonstrate 35.6% higher rewards and 36.6% lower costs compared to benchmarks on average. Sensitivity analyses validate the framework’s robustness across varying uncertainty."

The rate and power propagation expressions for both amplifiers are numerically solved to evaluate the gain performance across different wavelengths in the S+C band. However, increasing the doping concentration degrades the HOA’s performance due to the nonlinear ion-ion interaction mechanism (IM), including both homogeneous upconversion (HUC) and inhomogeneous upconversion (IUC). The mathematical model incorporates the gain variations induced by the combined effects of HUC and IUC. The gain characteristic obtained from the mathematical model is compared with a simulation model implemented in OptiSystem, considering IM and excluding IM. However, in the OptiSystem® model, IUC is not included for TDFA due to the software’s limitations. The numerical model demonstrates a gain of >28.17 dB across the entire S+C band, whereas the OptiSystem® model exhibits a gain of >21.95 dB over the same wavelength range. The gain variations observed due to the IM effect in the numerical and OptiSystem® models are <6.66% and <7.39%, respectively. Furthermore, at a wavelength of 1460 nm, the inclusion of IM effects results in a maximum gain enhancement of 2% observed at pump power 900 mW when increasing the pump power from 700 mW to 1500 mW, indicating early population inversion."

    "abstract": "Most state-of-the-art (SOTA) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning approaches depend on global environmental knowledge. While algorithms like adaptive soft actor-critic (ASAC) have improved training efficiency, their obstacle avoidance in partially observable environments remains limited. To address this, we propose a depth-based collision risk prediction (DCRP) algorithm that integrates into the ASAC framework. DCRP processes depth images alongside UAV pose and velocity to calculate a dense collision risk signal, enriching the reward function for more effective avoidance learning. Furthermore, we enhance the policy network with a novel skip connection that directly injects critical state information into the final action output. This innovation mitigates gradient vanishing and accelerates policy learning. Additionally, a generalized transfer learning (GTL) strategy accelerates convergence in complex environments by leveraging policies pre-trained in simpler ones. Extensive evaluation in high-fidelity AirSim environments demonstrates the superiority of our method. It outperforms several SOTA baselines, achieving an approximately 20% higher task success rate and 39% faster training efficiency on average, while maintaining a real-time inference time of around 15 ms."

Traditional arbitration methods for integrating automation and human inputs often rely on system-specific, parameter-dependent functions that are based on shared control metrics such as trust, workload, or attention. Meanwhile, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) enforce safety constraints on automated systems but are typically limited to safeguarding plant states. This work introduces a novel arbitration method based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), where shared control metrics such as workload, attention, and trust are expressed as real-time inequality constraints. The resulting quadratic-programming formulation determines the automation assistance input that enforces these constraints while preserving feasibility and safety. This CBF-based arbitration provides a systematic, interpretable, and scalable foundation for safe human–autonomy integration."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP, have enabled the task of open-vocabulary segmentation. CLIP demonstrates impressive zero-shot capabilities in various downstream tasks that require holistic image understanding. However, due to the image-level contrastive learning and fully global feature interaction, ViT-based CLIP struggles to capture local details, resulting in poor performance in segmentation tasks. Our analysis of ViT-based CLIP reveals that anomaly tokens emerge during the forward process, attracting disproportionate attention from normal patch tokens and thereby diminishing spatial awareness. To address this issue, we propose Self-Calibrated CLIP (SC-CLIP), a training-free method that calibrates CLIP to generate finer representations while preserving its original generalization ability—without introducing new parameters or relying on additional backbones. Specifically, we mitigate the negative impact of anomaly tokens from two complementary perspectives. First, we explicitly identify the anomaly tokens and replace them based on local context. Second, we reduce their influence on normal tokens by enhancing feature discriminability and attention correlation, leveraging the inherent semantic consistency within CLIP’s mid-level features. In addition, we introduce a two-pass strategy that effectively integrates multi-level features to enrich local details under the training-free setting. Together, these strategies enhance CLIP’s feature representations with improved granularity and semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SC-CLIP, achieving state-of-the-art results across all datasets and surpassing previous methods by 9.5%. Notably, SC-CLIP boosts the performance of vanilla CLIP ViT-L/14 by 6.8 times. Furthermore, we discuss our method’s applicability to other vision–language models and tasks for a comprehensive evaluation. Our source code is available at https://github.com/SuleBai/SC-CLIP."

    "abstract": "Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) is widely used in distributed services in Data Center Networks (DCNs) due to its high performance. As DCNs expand in scale, RDMA faces scalability issues. The reason is that the high concurrency Queue Pairs (QPs) lead to cache misses on RDMA Network Interface Card (RNIC) and frequent evictions, and the behaviour of fetching the cache via PCIe leads to performance degradation of RDMA. In this paper, we model the behaviour of Work Queue Element (WQE) on RNIC as a producer-consumer model and investigate that the root cause of WQE cache misses is the mismatch between the production rate of the CPU and the consumption rate of the RNIC. We design Weir from the perspective of WQE cache control to avoid cache misses and improve throughput under high concurrent QPs. Weir determines the cache occupancy on the RNIC by monitoring the number of active QPs and the increase/decrease in the life cycle of WQEs, and calculates the production rate and pacing by credit. The implementation of Weir exhibits minimal CPU overhead. Evaluation results show that Weir can maintain 97Gbps throughput without degradation even with up to 16K concurrent QPs, and effectively reduces various observable cache misses by <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$5\\times $</tex-math> </inline-formula> to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$10\\times $</tex-math> </inline-formula> compared to commercial RNICs.

Specifically, a max-min problem is formulated to jointly optimize the digital beamforming at the base station and BD-RIS configuration. We first focus on a fully-connected (FC) BD-RIS solving the problem via alternating WMMSE updates and Riemannian gradient descent. We then extend the method to group-connected (GC) and single-connected (SC) architectures. Simulations show FC achieves the highest fairness, GC offers near-FC performance with lower complexity, and SC maintains reasonable fairness with minimal hardware cost."

    "abstract": "Forest fires are a growing environmental threat, contributing to air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and ecosystem degradation. Due to their nonlinear dynamics and dependence on meteorological and topographical factors, predicting and managing wildfires remains challenging. This study proposes a hybrid model that directly couples a Deep Neural Network (DNN) ignition predictor with a physics-based Cellular Automata (CA) spread engine to improve wildfire prediction and propagation simulation. Unlike existing approaches that treat data-driven learning and physical simulation separately, the proposed model establishes a direct link between deep learning and physical simulation by tightly coupling a deep ignition predictor with a physics-based CA spread engine. The DNN’s fire-occurrence output—comprising a probability map and predicted ignition coordinates—is directly injected into the CA as seed fires, creating a seamless chain from ignition prediction to spatial propagation. By leveraging real-time meteorological data, including wind, temperature, humidity, and vegetation types, the proposed model accurately forecasts fire ignition points and simulates spatial fire spread across heterogeneous landscapes. Its CA rules integrate empirical fire physics and a spot-fire mechanism, ensuring realistic yet computationally efficient propagation. This hybrid approach enhances early detection, supports environmental risk control, and enables more effective mitigation strategies. The simulation results show that fire intensity increases with slope and wind, while humidity mitigates spread, offering guidance for targeted mitigation strategies. By combining a learned ignition predictor with a physically grounded and computationally efficient CA engine, the proposed model advances the practical realism of CA-based wildfire forecasting, offering a scalable and adaptable tool for proactive environmental management."

    "abstract": "Accurate surface defect detection is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and performance of wind turbine blades (WTB), thereby optimizing their operational reliability. Due to limitations in drone flight and the small size of certain defects, existing algorithms struggle to detect minor target defects within the high-resolution images associated with WTB. This paper proposes KGP-YOLO, an innovative detection method for WTB surface defects in high-resolution images, which for the first time introduces keypoint localization and Bi-Level Routing Cross-Attention (BRCA). The network comprises a filter and a detector. We propose the Keypoint-aware Geometric-guided Preprocessing Network (KGP-Net) as the filter, select the advanced object detection model YOLOv11 as the detector, and integrate the BRCA module into YOLOv11.Initially, KGP-Net is employed to identify blade regions within high-resolution images and extract cropped images containing only the blade regions. This ensures the model focuses exclusively on the target blade areas, minimizing interference from irrelevant background regions. Subsequently, integrating the BRCA module into YOLOv11 introduces a dynamic sparse self-attention mechanism, significantly enhancing the network’s ability to capture deep-level features essential for effectively identifying complex WTB surface defects. The proposed method achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 87.3% on the self-built SY-PLUS dataset, 92.4% on the public DTU dataset, and 88.5% on the public Blade30 dataset, while maintaining acceptable inference latency. Experimental results confirm that this method excels in detecting small object defects, even in high-resolution scenarios (e.g., 1080P), meeting the demands of practical applications."

However, their sensitivities are relatively low compared to other sensing methods such as surface plasma resonance (SPR). A novel coupled resonator was explored previously by integrating microscale pillars with QCM to achieve orders of magnitude improvement in the sensitivity of the QCMs. This study aims to further understand the coupling mechanism and the impact of micropillar geometry on the developed resonator performance. The micropillars with different cross-sectional shapes including square, circle, oval, and different heights, were studied to evaluate their effects the sensitivity enhancement and quality factor (Q-factor) of micropillar enhanced QCM. In addition, a 3D numerical model was developed to further understand the coupling behavior between the micropillars and QCM substrate. The results show that the sensitivity of the micropillar-enhanced QCM is greatly influenced by the micropillar’s height regardless of the micropillar shapes. This work provides valuable guidance to the design and performance improvement of the micropillar-QCM sensors for a variety application."

However, developing a robot e-skin that can cover the entire surface of a robot on a large scale still faces significant challenges in terms of flexibility, lightweight design, less-wires, and reduced computational complexity in signal processing to enhance robustness and biocompatibility. Inspired by the biological structure of the epidermis and dermis in human skin, this paper proposes a full-textile, less-wires, flexible robot e-skin suitable for large-area applications that can simultaneously and in real-time detect key tactile information such as touch position and force. The robot e-skin employs a cotton textile substrate integrated with a sensing layer of graphene, carbon nanotubes, and natural silk sericin, achieving lightweight and flexible mechanical properties. Integration with the CR5 collaborative robot demonstrates the tremendous potential of this electronic skin in enhancing human-machine interaction and safety collision avoidance."

    "abstract": "Multiscale sparse representation offers significant advantages in point cloud geometry compression, delivering state-of-the-art performance compared to both standardized solutions and other learned approaches. A crucial component of this framework is the cross-scale occupancy prediction, which employs the lower-scale reference representation either from the current frame alone or from both the current and temporal reference frames to establish conditional priors for either static or dynamic coding. However, existing works mainly use local computations, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e.g.</i>, sparse convolutions and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>NN attention, to exploit correlations in such a representation; these methods usually fail to adequately capture global coherence. In addition, the fixed configuration of lossless-lossy scales cannot adapt to temporal dynamics, which limits the reconstruction quality of temporal references in dynamic coding. These limitations constrain the generation of more effective priors used for conditional coding. To address these issues, we propose two new techniques. The first is KPA (Key Point-driven Attention), which integrates both local and global characteristics. The second is AdaScale (Adaptive Lossy/Lossless Scale), which decides whether the transitional scale should be in lossless or lossy mode based on temporal displacement, thereby enhancing the reconstruction quality of the temporal reference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including rules-based standard codecs like G-PCC and V-PCC, as well as learning-based approaches like Unicorn and TMAP, across both static/dynamic and lossy/lossless coding scenarios."

    "abstract": "Deployment of microwave-based sensors for ice detection faces significant challenges, including the lack of a wireless communication link, high costs and maintenance due to internal power sources, performance degradation when mounted on metallic surfaces, and susceptibility to environmental variations causing calibration difficulties. Addressing these issues, this article introduces a battery-free wireless ice detection sensor based on substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) resonators. All features of wireless connection, self-calibration, and noise resistance in one standard UHF RFID (Ultra High Frequency Radio Frequency Identification) band are realized simultaneously in a low-cost and robust architecture, utilizing a dual-band SIW configuration. This configuration includes two connected SIW cavities coupled through a window, an RFID chip connected and matched to the SIW cavity, an etched slot antenna on the SIW surface, and a sensing hole in the coupling window. One of the bands changes with the relative permittivity difference between ice and water within the sensing hole, while the other remains fixed to serve as a reference, allowing compensation for environmental changes and distance ambiguity. To validate the concept, the proposed wireless sensor was fabricated, and practical measurements were made by placing the sensor at a distance from an RFID reader. The sensor operates without a battery by harvesting energy from signals transmitted by the reader. The measured results at 906 MHz indicate significant phase changes between the air, water, and ice conditions. In contrast, no observable phase alteration occurred in the upper part of the band at 917 MHz. The proposed wireless sensor holds great promise for RFID applications and provides a highly reliable solution for ice detection on surfaces such as aircraft, wind turbines, and pipelines, as well as for other applications."

As a unit power block, submodule (SM) is a key component to achieve the scalability and reliability of the MMC. Therefore, it is important to test an SM under various operating conditions during the development stage before the final full assembly. To reduce the development cost and time, various methods have been presented to test a single SM without a full MMC assembly. Recently, owing to the advancement of processing power, real time simulators are beginning to be incorporated to test an MMC controller as a controller-hardware-in-the-loop-simulation. This article proposes the realization of a versatile powering test scheme for a single SM combining a real-time simulator, referred to as partial power-hardware-in-the-loop (partial PHIL) test. For demonstration, an industrial SM for a 5MW MMC-based motor drive system is tested using the partial PHIL test with full scale voltage and current levels. Various operating conditions are considered, including initial boosting operation, magnetization of the induction motor at standstill, full-load operation, and a step change in speed reference."

The model employs a composite loss function incorporating Dice, Focal, Tversky, and boundary losses to address class imbalance and complex anatomical variations. Evaluated on the CirrMRI600+ dataset, comprising 310 T1-weighted (T1W) and 318 T2-weighted (T2W) MRI scans, our approach achieved state-of-the-art performance with Dice scores of 0.9453 on T1W and 0.9018 on T2W, outperforming existing baselines by 6.6% and 4.3%, respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures for cirrhotic liver segmentation and highlight the potential for integrating such models into clinical workflows for fibrosis staging, volumetric assessment, and treatment planning."

    "abstract": "The dangerous electricity consumption behaviors of enterprises may lead to energy-related safety incidents during the production process, like overloading. To address these risks, the government has increasingly relied on Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled monitoring systems to analyze electricity consumption curves in real-time. The essence of government monitoring electricity consumption behaviors is to conduct a comparative analysis of electricity consumption curves in combination with historical data. However, there are two difficulties in the working process: 1. Clustering based on time-series data is the core of electricity curve analysis, but existing methods are only suitable for clustering discrete data points. 2. It is prone to misjudge behaviors not existing in historical data, lacking of common feature capture for behaviors. Therefore, this paper proposes an IoT-integrated early warning method operated within a multi-layered IoT architecture (perception → network → edge → cloud). First of all, designing a time-series feature capture enhancement module based on Self-Organizing Mapping (SOM) and Hierarchical Clustering algorithm (HCA). The SOM is utilized to capture the features of the power consumption curves, and the capture effect is enhanced through reintegration by HCA. Secondly, constructing a multi-scale feature extraction ensemble fusion framework. Exploring the common features of electricity consumption behavior avoids the situation of misjudgment during the work process. Finally, through the practical application in the regional power grid of a certain area in China, the proposed method achieves an early warning accuracy of 97.99%, which is more than 20% higher than that of the current methods."

Previous studies have proposed a range of project team resilience activities to address types of disruption, suggesting that different team resilience capacities require different resources. Drawing on the capacity view of team resilience, this study adopts a mixed-methods research approach. The qualitative phase reveals that (1) goal volatility is the most common creeping disruption, while anticipating change, planning adjustment, and adapting to new practices are the three components of ITT program team resilience; and (2) change potency, program psychological safety, business understanding, and IT improvisation are key resources in fostering ITT program resilience capacity. A quantitative survey of 177 ITT programs was used to externally validate and extend the qualitative findings. Results confirmed that ITT program team resilience significantly enhances program performance, particularly under conditions of high program goal volatility, and four identified resources are positively associated with ITT program resilience capacity. This study extends the literature on IT project management by distinguishing program team resilience in the ITT program context from project team resilience."

This paper proposes a second-order cone programming (SOCP) estimator for vehicle cooperative localization based on Polarized Identity fusion of the relative distance (RD) and the angle of arrival (AOA) between the target vehicle and the base station. First, the positioning error between the target CAVs and the base station is studied in a three dimensional (3D) driving environment. Second, with assumption of unknown and known NLOS status information, the optimal estimation analysis of SOCP is carried out using the polarized identity method. Meanwhile, the complexity and accuracy of the proposed algorithm are evaluated under different driving scenarios, both with and without the NLOS status information between the target CAVs and the base station. The simulation results show that the localization performance of the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art in the simulations environment of the vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). Finally, the experiment results demonstrate the ability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to handle NLOS scenarios with known status information."

In this paper, a control method for unbalanced current in grid type energy storage based on negative sequence virtual impedance is proposed, analyze the reasons for the fluctuation of grid type energy storage current, and adopts the inner-loop positive-negative sequence separation control method, adding virtual impedance to suppress the negative sequence current only in the negative sequence control loop. And the relationship between the virtual impedance values and system stability in the background of grid harmonics are analyzed. Finally, simulations and experiments show that the addition of virtual impedance only in negative sequence does not affect the normal operating conditions, but has the characteristic of producing effects under unbalanced grid voltage. The method is simple to implement and the output current and active power fluctuations of the grid type energy storage are effectively suppressed."

    "abstract": "Multimodal intent recognition is vital for understanding human interactions across diverse real-world scenarios, leveraging various modalities to discern user intents. However, current approaches predominantly prioritize text, overlooking rich semantic cues in video modalities, such as body language and expressions, which are closely linked to intent and can be more easily integrated with both text and audio semantics. This paper introduces ViSK, a Visual Semantic Knowledge Discovery model using adaptive perturbation and gradient-based quantification. First, we employ Video Swin Transformer as the backbone to extract feature maps from video frames in the form of spatiotemporal blocks which are considered as the elementary units of visual semantics. Then, we employ an adaptive perturbation module to generate instance-aware noises by transforming input features into perturbation parameters through stacked convolution layers. The noises are applied to obtain perturbed features after scaling. Finally, on the basis of high-quality perturbed features, we introduce a quantification mechanism by estimating gradients based on the DNN’s Lipschitz condition to evaluate the contribution of each spatiotemporal block for intent recognition. The original features are then weighted by the quantification score to achieve visual semantic knowledge features for video-based intent recognition. To assess the effectiveness of discovered visual semantics in enhancing multimodal fusion, we also construct a multimodal intent recognition framework to refine and leverage semantic features. Extensive experiments across two challenging datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Visualization results provide deeper insights into discovered semantics and serve as a pioneering work for interpretability research in multimodal intent recognition <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a</sup>."

    "abstract": "Internet service providers (ISPs) require modern networks to deliver high service satisfaction across diverse traffic types while maintaining minimal operational overhead. Traditional routing algorithms, although computationally efficient, rely on fixed heuristics and often fail to accommodate increasingly dynamic and heterogeneous network demands. In contrast, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based routing algorithms offer greater flexibility but typically introduce considerable computational cost. This issue is especially pronounced in prevalent centralized software-defined networking (SDN) architectures, resulting in excessive overhead and increased latency as the network grows. In this paper, we model a hybrid-traffic network scenario and propose a quality of service (QoS)-aware and low-cost routing algorithm based on graph reinforcement learning within a hybrid knowledge-defined networking (KDN) architecture. Routing decisions are jointly made by a global controller and distributed forwarding devices, with the unified objective of maximizing the minimum service satisfaction rate across the network. To reduce computational overhead and minimize disruptions from frequent route updates, we investigate two efficient implementation strategies: partial deployment (horizontal) and intermittent activation (vertical). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms benchmarks regarding the minimum service satisfaction rate, even under previously unseen topologies. Remarkably, our evaluation shows that 50% of the maximum achievable performance gain can be obtained through a lightweight implementation where just 28.5% of forwarding devices conduct policy inference, operating for only 60% of the total run time."

    "abstract": "Objective: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses a significant challenge for central nervous system drug delivery due to its selective permeability. Focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with bubble agents enables non-invasive, targeted BBB disruption. However, current methods for assessing efficacy and safety have limitations of high cost, low temporal resolution, or moderate predictive reliability, etc. Methods: This study proposes a novel gated attention-based model (GAB) for predicting BBB opening outcomes using time-domain acoustic signal clips. The GAB architecture incorporates an acoustic encoder to extract spectral and temporal features from short clips while modeling dependency between adjacent clips. A multi-way gated attention mechanism aggregates clip-level features, enhancing inter-class discriminability through adaptive selection. A task-specific loss function combining classification and similarity constraints further improves prediction by reducing redundancy in attention patterns. The outcomes of 174 FUS treatments were classified into three categories: BBB not opened, BBB opened without hemorrhage, and BBB opened with hemorrhage. Results: The GAB achieved superior performance in hemorrhage prediction (accuracy = 86.6 ± 4.9%, recall = 82.1 ± 10.9%, AUC = 0.894 ± 0.036, F1 score = 0.846 ± 0.062) compared to traditional cavitation dose-based methods and our previously developed frequency-domain deep learning models. Visualization of attention weights revealed that the model effectively distinguished broadband inertial cavitation signals (associated with hemorrhage) from ultra-harmonic stable cavitation signals (linked to safe BBB opening). Conclusion: The proposed method enhances temporal resolution, achieves superior predictive performance with interpretable cavitation features, and shows strong potential for real-time outcome prediction in FUS-mediated BBB disruption."

Pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) play a critical role in this field, serving as compliant actuators capable of generating substantial forces. However, this type of actuator still faces challenges in generating bidirectional force over a large range of motion. In this article, we introduce a three-dimensional (3-D)-printed PAM with a telescopic structure using a nested structure. The actuator's large volumetric deformation enables it to generate high bidirectional forces using positive and negative pressures, while also providing a wide range of motion with significant extension and contraction ratios. The use of 3-D printing not only simplifies the design and fabrication process but also offers significant advantages in mass production and industrial implementation. The proposed actuator can generate an extension blocked force of 659 N with an extension ratio of 447.1% and contract with payloads up to 7 kg up to a contraction ratio of 76.9%. A rotational configuration of the actuator is also presented with a blocked torque of 18.5 Nm. These actuators were then implemented into grippers and extendable links for robotic manipulators."

In this article, we present a novel switchable variable stiffness actuator (SVSA) with 2 degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) for legged walking robots, capable of modulating output stiffness without changing potential energy stored in the spring and overcoming spring force, to perform energetically conservative legged locomotion. We introduce two independently controlled motors to drive both ends of a lockable spring along the shank and thigh, and the locking module consists of a globoid worm and worm gear for rigid locking, along with a solenoid to actively control the engagement of the spring with fast speed. Experiments validate the locking robustness and efficiency of the lockable spring, verifies the energy efficiency of the proposed SVSA. Finally, the applicability of the proposed SVSA to legged walking robot is comprehensively explored to propose an energy-efficient locomotion strategy."

However, the growing diversity of modulation schemes in dynamic environments, coupled with the scarcity of labeled training data, poses significant challenges for few-shot incremental AMR (FSI-AMR) in dynamically changing wireless communication environment. To address this issue, FSI-AMR offers a promising solution. In this work, we introduce an adversarial margin-guided rectified prototypical learning (AMG-RPL) framework, which effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting of base modulation classes while improving adaptability to novel modulation types. The proposed approach integrates an adversarial margin learning mechanism with dual classifiers during base training, enabling the extraction of transferable modulation-invariant features while retaining discriminative modulation-specific characteristics. Furthermore, a rectified prototype learning strategy is designed to refine class prototypes in incremental sessions, minimizing cognitive bias and facilitating rapid few-shot adaptation. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that AMG-RPL outperforms existing advanced methods in FSI-AMR tasks."

However, coordination among agents remains challenging due to limited observability, often leading to inefficient exploration of policy spaces and increased communication overhead. Existing communication mechanisms partially alleviate these issues but typically add complexity without adapting to changing conditions. We propose the signaling-driven incentive communication (SDIC) framework, a novel approach that integrates Markov signaling games (MSGs) into CTDE to enable more efficient and targeted interagent communication. By integrating value-based methods with sparse communication, SDIC reduces unnecessary exchanges while generating tailored signals that enhance policy alignment and improve coordination. Furthermore, SDIC incorporates partner modeling, allowing agents to anticipate the behavior of others and thus strike an effective balance between communication efficiency and computational complexity. Our experimental results, including extensive evaluations in StarCraft II and SUMO traffic simulations, demonstrate SDIC’s superior coordination, task success, and communication efficiency with manageable computational complexity. Ablation studies validate the critical roles of SDIC’s components in reducing overhead and ensuring effective policy alignment."

    "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) communication technology is regarded as a promising enabler for achieving ultra-high data rate transmission in next-generation communication systems. To mitigate the high path loss in THz systems, the transmitting beams are typically narrow and highly directional, which makes it difficult for a single beam to serve multiple users simultaneously. To address this challenge, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), which can dynamically steer the incident electromagnetic waves, have been integrated into THz communication systems to extend coverage. Existing works mostly remain theoretical analysis and simulation, while prototype validation of RIS-assisted THz systems is scarce. In this paper, we designed a kind of liquid crystal-based RIS operating at 220 GHz supporting both single-user and multi-user communication scenarios, followed by a 220 GHz THz-RIS communication system prototype. To support simultaneous multi-user transmission, we designed an OFDM-based resource allocation scheme. Beamforming optimization is performed in both single and muti-user scenarios. Specifically, to enhance the system performance of multi-user scenario, we developed a received power based feedback control method. In our experiments, the received power gain with RIS is no less than 10 dB in the single-beam mode, and no less than 5 dB in the multi-beam mode, compared to the case without RIS. With the assistance of RIS, the achievable rate of the system could reach 2.341 Gbps with 3 users sharing 2 GHz bandwidth and the bit error rate (BER) of the system decreased sharply. Finally, an image transmission experiment was conducted to vividly show that the receiver could recover the transmitted information correctly with the help of RIS. The experimental results also demonstrated that the received signal quality was enhanced through power feedback adjustments."

    "abstract": "The classical asynchronous fault diagnosis method requires that the communications between a plant and a diagnoser are reliable, i.e., the diagnoser can receive all information recorded by sensors. However, in some practical networked systems, it is possible that some observations generated by the system are lost, due to sensor failure or communication malfunction between the sensors and the diagnoser. In such a case, the traditional asynchronous fault diagnosis approach is not applicable. In this work, we study the asynchronous diagnosis problem subject to intermittent sensor failures, which is called <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">robustly asynchronous diagnosis</i>.

Moreover, a necessary and sufficient condition for determining the robustly asynchronous diagnosability is established by using the developed diagnoser structure. Finally, a manufacturing process example is presented to illustrate the introduced approach."

The existing FFDL data model fails to incorporate system dynamics and disregards valuable prior knowledge. This study proposes a more robust, time-varying data model achieved by integrating a network of local autoregressive with exogenous inputs (ARX) models into the FFDL structure. This allows the new model to incorporate partial, prior knowledge of the nonlinear system’s dynamics across various operating points. By leveraging the structural similarity between FFDL and ARX models, the proposed multi-ARX (M-ARX) model provides a more global and physically grounded understanding of the system, replacing the nonphysical approximation of the traditional FFDL method. The proposed controller’s practicality is demonstrated on a nonlinear multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) three-tank system (3TS). Its performance is compared with the traditional MFAC-FFDL approach across diverse measurement noise conditions to more accurately reflect real-world experimental scenarios, employing multiple control performance criteria. The results show that the novel M-ARX-MFAC consistently tracks desired references by incorporating local system information through weighted ARX coefficients. Its data model parameters demonstrate a more robust evolution when subjected to measurement noise. When operating with identical control parameters, M-ARX-MFAC significantly outperforms MFAC-FFDL in terms of both input intensity and smoothness across various measurement noise scenarios."

To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel XSS attack detection model based on two-stage Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, effectively mitigating the impact of adversarial samples. Our model leverages the ability of AST parsing and analysis of HTML and JavaScript code to effectively eliminate redundant information and adversarial perturbations introduced by adversarial samples. The two-stage process first extracts JavaScript code from the HTML AST, then identifies malicious code fragments from the JavaScript AST. Finally, the LSTM neural network is trained to classify samples as malicious or benign. By analyzing the HTML and JavaScript components of web pages, our model identifies and eliminates adversarial perturbations that interfere with detection, significantly enhancing the security and reliability of the detection process. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate our model's superior performance, achieving an accuracy rate of 0.991 and an F1 score of 0.998 against standard XSS samples, outperforming existing models. More importantly, when facing adversarial XSS samples, most existing detection models exhibit severe robustness degradation with the detection rate (DR) below 0.880, whereas our model maintains a detection rate of over 0.982, significantly higher than state-of-the-art models and demonstrating its significant effectiveness in defending against XSS adversarial attacks."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a theoretical analysis and experimental validation of a recently proposed scalable optical multibeam beamformer architecture based on an Xbar layout, confirming its scalability and robustness to fabrication errors compared to state-of-the-art optical multibeam architectures. It is shown that the Xbar architecture enables efficient routing and combination of optical signals to form distinct, independently controlled radiation patterns. A comprehensive theoretical analysis of the crossbar beamformer underscores its scalability by comparing 4×64 Xbar and Blass matrix architectures using typical phase shifter loss values. The Xbar beamformer exhibits a 23 dB loss, while the Blass matrix reveals a loss exceeding 129 dB which results in a >100 dB gap between the two architectures. Furthermore, the robustness to fabrication errors is analyzed using a beamforming fidelity metric, which in the Xbar architecture exceeds 97% even for a 64×64 array in the presence of significant fabrication imperfections. Experimental validation of the beamformer's capabilities in beam steering and multibeam operation is presented using a 4×4 silicon photonic integrated circuit. Beam scanning is demonstrated by successfully tuning the beamformer's phase shifters to match the transmit position, emulated by proper phasing of the four input signals. Finally, multibeam operation is experimentally demonstrated by successfully distinguishing four distinct signals with BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK, and 16QAM modulation formats arriving simultaneously at the four beamformer input ports, with their phases configured to emulate simultaneous transmission from four orthogonal directions. The results confirm the multibeam beamformer's capability to accurately separate the four signals, effectively resolving them from their respective spatial directions, achieving EVM values of 28.6% for BPSK, 26.5% for QPSK, 25.0% for 8PSK, and 12.9% for 16QAM."

This paper studies a channel access problem in an uplink MBN. To solve the integer programming problem efficiently and distributedly, we develop a multi-dimensional conflict graph to model the band-related interference relationship and construct a generalized local altruistic game. The proposed game tackles the action-related neighbor problem and we prove that it is an exact potential game, with the social welfare being the potential function. A distributed algorithm utilizing spatial adaptive play is implemented to determine the optimal Nash equilibrium. Simulations indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the local altruistic game and a classic graph coloring algorithm."

In this work, we present a highly flexible hardware acceleration unit for HDC learning tasks based on the binary spatter-code model. Integrated into the execution stage of the Klessydra-T03 RISC-V core, the unit accelerates the core arithmetic operations of HDC and can be configured at synthesis time in terms of hardware parallelism, supported operations, and size of the local memories, trading off execution time with hardware resources to match application needs. A custom RISC-V Instruction Set Extension efficiently controls the accelerator, with instructions fully integrated into the GNU Compiler Collection toolchain and exposed to the programmer as intrinsics. Dedicated Control and Status Registers allow specifying the characteristics of the high-dimensional space and the target learning tasks at runtime, controlling the hardware loops of the accelerator and enabling the same hardware architecture to be used for various tasks. The dual flexibility coming from hardware configuration and software programmability sets this work apart from application-specific solutions in the literature, offering a unique, versatile accelerator adaptable to a wide range of applications and learning tasks."

We analyze and highlight the advantages of adopting inner data levels for error sampling. To mitigate the worsened ISI-induced jitter in multilevel signaling, this work further proposes an unbalanced MMPD operation that improves the phase detection confidence, easing the trade-off between dithering jitter and tracking ability. Our results demonstrate that the unbalanced MMPD design effectively enhances PD gain, making it a promising solution for high-speed wireline transceivers. The unbalanced MMPD is integrated into the CDR circuit of an 80-Gb/s PAM6 receiver for verification. The receiver features a 3-bit SAR ADC with uneven slicing levels. Utilizing LSB conversion for error sampling, this ADC achieves data and error sampling without additional error samplers. Measurement results from a 28-nm CMOS prototype demonstrate higher tracking bandwidth with an eye-opening margin of over 176 mUI. At 80 Gb/s, the receiver consumes 166.5 mW with an energy efficiency of 2.08 pJ/bit."

    "abstract": "Traditional finite-time/fixed-time control methods have been extensively studied due to their ability to quantitatively determine the settling time of a system. However, these approaches have several drawbacks, such as slow convergence rates, state-dependent settling times, and low control precision. To address these limitations, this paper presents an innovative fast fixed-time control theory based on a variable exponential strategy. This approach significantly improves the practical convergence speed and control accuracy, while eliminating the drawback of state-dependent settling time inherent in conventional finite-time control frameworks. Leveraging the proposed theory, a high-precision fast fixed-time sliding mode control scheme is developed for permanent magnet synchronous motors. This methodology significantly improves control accuracy and reduces practical convergence time through the variable exponential strategy. Lyapunov stability analysis proves that the closed-loop tracking error can converge rapidly to an ultra-small neighbourhood near the origin within a fixed time. Experimental results further validate the superiority of the proposed scheme, demonstrating exceptional performance in key metrics, including convergence speed and control accuracy. The latter achieves an enhancement of up to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$55.1\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula>.

    "abstract": "Rogowski coil (RC), valued for its high bandwidth, galvanic isolation, and ease of integration, is widely employed in high-speed integrated power electronics. However, near-magnetic interference (NMI) arising from inductive coupling with adjacent current sources is often underestimated, which undermines the RC's robustness in crucial applications such as characterization, protection, and control. This paper first reveals the inevitability of NMI in RCs. Building upon this, the mutual inductance equation between the RC and external interference sources is derived in detail, establishing a solid theoretical foundation for efficient and quantitative interference evaluation. The derivation methodology is further generalized to arbitrary points in space, allowing for the quantitative analysis of the effect when the circuit under test (CUT) is offset from the RC's center. Theoretical analysis highlights the number of turns as a key factor, demonstrating that appropriately increasing it can effectively mitigate the influence of both external NMI and internal CUT eccentricity. The inherent design trade-off between measurement bandwidth and interference immunity is further analyzed. Design guidelines for establishing the upper and lower limits of the number of turns are derived, and the differential mode rejection ratio (DMRR) is introduced as an intuitive metric to quantify the interference suppression capability. The accuracy of the proposed NMI model and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies are corroborated by Ansys Q3D simulations and extensive frequency- and time-domain experiments."

A typical fusion paradigm is that all sensors are pre-configured and hard-wired with respect to a specific environment or task, which means that such a fusion is exclusively customized to a pre-defined PNT task. Even the plug-and-play PNT systems still rely on specific types and numbers of sensors and positioning algorithms. As a consequence, it would be difficult for this established fusion to be freely and promptly adapted to fit another PNT environment or task, and PNT users would have to re-configure the hardware and re-compile the software PNT systems. In this study, we propose a novel multi-sensor fusion framework, i.e., “componentized PNT”, where all candidate sensors, regardless of their types and quantities, are taken as plug-and-play components to be freely connected to a central PNT platform with regard to switching environments and tasks. Our componentized PNT is featured by an edge-computing architecture and a standard hardware/software interface definition, and as a result, the sensor-specific processing algorithm is deployed in the edge sensors while the sensor-shared fusion algorithm deployed in the central PNT platform. This standardized interface allows a PNT fusion solution for a new task or environment to be rapidly established without modifying the platform software or reconfiguring hardware interfaces, thereby achieving a higher level of scalability compared with typical plug-and-play systems. A hardware prototype was developed and validated through real-time experiments involving sensor addition, disconnection, and replacement in complex environments. As sensor components are integrated, the system consistently achieves 34-78% improvement in 3D positioning accuracy, demonstrating the system’s true plug-and-play capability and autonomous reconfiguration across multiple domains and dynamic tasks."

    "abstract": "Transient signals in radar or communication systems need to be rapidly identified and analyzed; a high-speed acquisition system is frequently used to capture and analyze such signals. However, the generation of a substantial volume of data at a high sampling rate poses challenges for storage space and processing speed. Such high-frequency, short-duration signals are hard to acquire until the system runs out of space, or the acquisition system has not completed the processing when these signals appear. Therefore, spectrum sensing is used in the high-speed acquisition system to capture and process the valid frequency interval of signals, thereby filtering out invalid signals. Traditional serial spectrum sensing architectures are unable to fast process data with tens of Gbps throughput and multi-GHz bandwidth, resulting in slow response and the effective information loss of signals. To solve the problem, a parallel spectrum sensing structure based on weighted-overlap-add (WOLA) with energy detector (ED) is proposed. An efficient filter bank is used to decompose the wideband signal into several narrowband signals, and then the narrowband signals are simultaneously detected based on an energy detection method. Compared with the traditional filter banks, the complex convolution operation is directly changed into lightweight multiply-accumulate operations, which greatly reduce the amount of computational complexity. The proposed structure is designed and implemented in the high-speed acquisition system with a sampling rate of 20 GSa/s and a sensing bandwidth of 8 GHz. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed structure achieves a frequency resolution of 2.44 MHz, the fastest spectrum sensing time of less than 20.26 <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">µ</i>s, and a data throughput of 20.944 Gbps. For signals with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) higher than 5 dB, the detection probability is more than 90%. The transient signals can be effectively captured by deploying the proposed structure in a high-speed acquisition system."

We formulate the problem of placing optoelectronic transmitters (TXs, e.g., lasers) and receivers (RXs, e.g., photodetectors (PDs)) on a transceiver plane. The formulation aims to maximize the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) among two hovering UAVs. We prove that the optimum tiling of TX and RX elements on an in-band full-duplex (IBFD) transceiver is NP-complete. Using a genetic algorithm (GA), we investigate solutions to the optimum tiling problem for various transceiver shapes, including circular, hexagonal, rectangular, and square shapes. The optimum SINR does not occur at a fixed coverage ratio but instead varies non-monotonically with link range. For each transceiver shape, we find diverse tiling patterns until the grid size becomes equal to the beam footprint. Furthermore, we identify unique laser placement patterns for each transceiver shape that sustain optimal performance over varying link ranges. Despite the increasing number of TXs (28 at 40 m to 52 at 100 m for square shape transceiver), the GA finds the same optimized tiling geometry, allowing the design to scale across distances for multiple platforms without need for mechanical steering."

    "abstract": "Time series domain adaptation aims to transfer the complex temporal dependence from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain. Recent advances leverage the stable causal mechanism over observed variables to model the domain-invariant temporal dependence. However, modeling precise causal structures in high-dimensional data, such as videos, remains challenging. Additionally, direct causal edges may not exist among observed variables (e.g., pixels). These limitations hinder the applicability of existing approaches to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we find that the high-dimension time series data are generated from the low-dimension latent variables, which motivates us to model the causal mechanisms of the temporal latent process. Based on this intuition, we propose a latent causal mechanism identification framework that guarantees the uniqueness of the reconstructed latent causal structures. Specifically, we first identify latent variables by utilizing sufficient changes in historical information. Moreover, by enforcing the sparsity of the relationships of latent variables, we can achieve identifiable latent causal structures. Built on the theoretical results, we develop the Latent Causality Alignment (<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">LCA</b>) model that leverages variational inference, which incorporates an intra-domain latent sparsity constraint for latent structure reconstruction and an inter-domain latent sparsity constraint for domain-invariant structure reconstruction. Experiment results on eight benchmarks show a general improvement in the domain-adaptive time series classification and forecasting tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios.

    "abstract": "Decision-making in city autonomous driving is considered highly challenging due to the randomness of dynamic participants and the complexity of road structures and rules. Although teacher-student knowledge distillation holds promise for addressing urban driving scenarios, it generally suffers from low teacher utilization, which undermines driving safety and route completion rate. In this paper, a Causal Representation-Augmented Joint Decision-Making (CRAJ) framework is proposed to enhance the representational capacity of the teacher model through causal representation, enabling it to provide tailored instruction for reinforcement learning-based student. Based on this foundation, CRAJ incorporates the Clustered Collaborative Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) algorithm to expand student exploration through a multi-population co-evolutionary mechanism. Furthermore, during the inference phase, CRAJ integrates the Unsupervised Confidence Mamba (UCM) component to optimize teacher-student collaborative decision-making by evaluating state confidence, thereby avoiding high-risk decisions. Validation has been conducted in a series of simulated and real-world scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed decision scheme has increased driving scores by 17.6% in simulated environments and improved success rates by 16.4% in real-world testing, significantly enhancing the safety, sample efficiency, and decision-making performance."

    "abstract": "Double patch clamp technique, using two micropipette electrodes to patch and measure electrophysiological signals of two neurons, is essential for investigating the functional connections between neurons in brain. However, the interactive mechanical disturbances from the dual-micropipette motions inside viscoelastic brain tissue cause dynamic drifts of neurons, making double patching low efficiency and challenging. In this paper, an interactive mechanical modeling of two micropipettes approaching two cells in elastic environment was established to estimate the dynamic drift of the cells. Based on that, a synchronous descent strategy, an appropriate relative position of two cells, and an online trajectory plan of two micropipettes were determined to improve double patch clamp efficiency. Finally, a robotic double patch clamp operation process was established for functional connectivity measurement between neurons in brain slice. The effectiveness of the proposed work is validated through both finite element modeling and experiments. The double patch clamp experiments on neurons in visual cortex demonstrate that our method achieves a 40% improvement in success rate and a 38% improvement in speed in comparison to the traditional manual method. With the above advantages, diverse functional connectivity activities between neurons were found using our system, paving a solid ground for further research."

We propose a Homotopy Optimization Method (HOM) tailored for the narrow passage problem, utilizing a novel collision constraint interpolation method using signed distance functions (SDF). The framework begins by decomposing the environment into convex objects and representing it as a simplicial complex based on their connectivity. This representation enables topological analysis to induce a easy-to-hard sequence of collision constraint interpolation that preserves homotopy equivalence. Using this collision constraint interpolation, the optimization proceeds through a series of subproblems, gradually guiding the path to the final solution. Several examples are presented to demonstrate how the proposed framework addresses narrow passage path planning problems."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive framework for 6G-enabled cooperative robotics, focusing on decentralized multi-robot Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). We propose standardized communication protocols, data formats, and architectural principles to enable seamless real-time collaboration among robotic agents. A feature-based map representation is introduced to facilitate efficient and lightweight data exchange, while 6G network slicing is leveraged to ensure ultra-reliable, low-latency communication for both control and mapping traffic. We implement a decentralized multi-quadrotor SLAM system for feature tracking, validated through 3D simulations in a dynamic environment. Results demonstrate successful collaborative mapping and localization despite sensor noise and intermittent communication. The study highlights the transformative potential of 6G in enabling scalable, reliable, and efficient cooperative robotic systems."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a planar co-aperture co-polarized in-band full-duplex (IBFD) 2-D phased antenna array, which has two independent steering beams with a wide scanning range. A two-port slot-coupled patch antenna is proposed as the high port-isolation dual-polarized element for the 2-D IBFD phased array. The sequential rotation strategy is firstly theoretically revealed for achieving high beam-isolations of the co-circularly-polarized (CP) IBFD array with two simultaneously steering beams. To validate the proposed method, a 10 × 10 co-aperture IBFD prototype was fabricated and measured. Measured results show that two beams can independently scan within ± 50°, and the average beam-isolation is over 41.3 dB within 10.6 to 12.3 GHz. The prototype can be operated with either a co-circular-polarized state or an orthogonal-circular-polarized state, and two steering beams can be operated simultaneously for transmitting, receiving, or both. And all radiation beams’ characteristics keep unchanged with all operating states. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first co-aperture co-polarized IBFD phased array enabling dual-beam independent steering functionality. It shows promising capability for in-band full-duplex applications."

    "abstract": "Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have recently achieved brilliant achievements in computer vision. Inspired by the success of DPMs, we present TrajDiff, a model based on conditional diffusion probabilistic models for agent future trajectory prediction, which speculates the agent future states through a series of stochastic iterative denoising processes. Specifically, we map the trajectory prediction task into the latent heatmap space, translating hard keypoint prediction into soft cluster center learning. The core architecture is a U-shaped encoder-decoder network (U-Net) that is trained with a denoising objective. During inference, conditioned on the observed past trajectory heatmaps, random pure Gaussian noise is initialized to drive the reverse sampling process. The U-Net iteratively removes various levels of Gaussian noise from initialized images, resembling Langevin dynamics, and generates multi-modal predicted future trajectory heatmaps. Furthermore, we introduce a novel residual block with a mutual attention mechanism that can elegantly consider the interactions between the agent and the surrounding environment at multiple scales, assisting in generating physically and socially acceptable trajectories. We verify TrajDiff on the Stanford Drone Dataset and the ETH and UCY Datasets. The experimental results show that TrajDiff outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with considerable accuracy gains, while significantly reducing computational requirements."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of Vision Language Models (VLMs), VLM-based Image Quality Assessment (IQA) seeks to describe image quality linguistically to align with human expression and capture the multifaceted nature of IQA tasks. However, current methods are still far from practical usage. First, prior works focus narrowly on specific sub-tasks or settings, which do not align with diverse real-world applications. Second, their performance is sub-optimal due to limitations in dataset coverage, scale, and quality. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Enhanced Descriptive image Quality Assessment (EDQA). Our method includes a multi-functional IQA task paradigm that encompasses both assessment and comparison tasks, brief and detailed responses, full-reference and non-reference scenarios. We introduce a ground-truth-informed dataset construction approach to enhance data quality, and scale up the dataset to 495K under the brief-detail joint framework. Consequently, we construct a comprehensive, large-scale, and high-quality dataset, named EDQA-495K. We also retain image resolution during training to better handle resolution-related quality issues, and estimate a confidence score that is helpful to filter out low-quality responses. Experimental results demonstrate that EDQA significantly outperforms traditional score-based methods, prior VLM-based IQA models, and proprietary GPT-4V in distortion identification, instant rating, and reasoning tasks. Our advantages are further confirmed by real-world applications including assessing the web-downloaded images and ranking model-processed images. Datasets and codes will be released."

    "abstract": "Benefiting from smartphones' powerful computing and sensing capabilities, biometric authentication is widely applied to them for conveniently verifying users' identities. However, most biometric features can be easily acquired or reproduced, making them vulnerable to replay and impersonation attacks. To address this issue, we propose DBreathLock, a non-contact deep breath-based authentication system that utilizes a smartphone emitting inaudible frequency-modulated continuous waves (FMCW)-based sonar signals and synchronously records breath sounds and sonar echoes of chest-abdominal-joint (C-A-joint) movements. Then, we implement a dual-protection barrier to defend against advanced replay attacks (ARAs). First, by analyzing the energy features of C-A-joint movements, we develop a Deep Breath Activity Detection method to detect deep breath fragments alongside the capability of resisting ARAs. Second, we take C-A-joint movements and smartphone vibrations caused by holding a smartphone as features and design a liveness detection mechanism to further fortify the resistance to ARAs. Furthermore, a multi-stream identity authentication model is designed to verify legitimate users by fusing biometric features from C-A-joint movements, deep breath sounds, and correlation sequences of both. Extensive real-world experiments with 40 users demonstrate DBreathLock's authentication accuracy of 95.97%. Additionally, it successfully defends against advanced replay, impersonation, simple hybrid, and advanced hybrid attacks, achieving the AUC of 0.9792, and FPRs of 2.17%, 2%, and 4.17%, respectively."

    "abstract": "Underwater networking is vital for enabling collaboration between divers, vehicles, and sensors in marine exploration, monitoring, and emergency response. Yet achieving reliable communication in such dynamic, bandwidth constrained environments remains challenging. Acoustic and radio frequency technologies suffer from attenuation, latency, and hardware overhead, while optical wireless systems typically require specialized transceivers or strict alignment, limiting practicality in mobile underwater networks. To address these limitations, we present AquaLink, a QR code–driven Optical Camera Communication (OCC) framework that enables robust underwater messaging using commodity smartphones and tablets. At its core, AquaQR employs blue–green 2-bit color encoding, Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) error correction, and geometric augmentations tailored for optical stability in turbid waters. An auto-configuration module adapts parameters before transmission, and a lightweight enhancement pipeline ensures real-time robustness under diverse conditions. Field trials in pool, lake, and coastal environments achieve over 90% decoding success at 5 m and up to 2× higher throughput than prior QR-based systems. By eliminating specialized hardware, AquaLink provides a scalable, low cost foundation for underwater visual networking, supporting message exchange, peer interaction, and localized link formation."

The scheme exploits the narrowband gain characteristics of SBS to efficiently compress broadband echo signals into narrow pulses within the optical domain. Target distance is demodulated in real time by directly measuring the time delay of the transmitted signal after pulse compression. This method breaks through the bandwidth limitations of traditional electronic ranging technology and reduces processing latency. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves flexible tuning and expansion of distance resolution (<4.12 m) and maximum unambiguous range (>750 m). The minimum relative error for long-distance measurements is as low as 0.132%, with a detection sensitivity better than −50 dBm."

    "abstract": "Manual composite layup processes are labor intensive and highly dependent on operator skill, often resulting in inconsistent quality. Although high-precision systems such as Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) exist, their use is frequently limited by high cost, fixed gantry architectures, and restricted steering capability on complex geometries. This paper presents a mobile dual-arm robotic system for semi-automated composite layup using prepreg strips. The proposed system is mobile and can reposition itself to access large or highly curved molds without dedicated infrastructure. The platform integrates structured-light 3D vision for pose estimation of deformable prepreg strips and mold surfaces, dual-arm manipulation for material handling, and hybrid force/motion control for compliant compression along non-planar geometries. The mobile base autonomously repositions around the mold to extend the effective layup workspace beyond the reach of a fixed-base manipulator. Experiments on a multi-angled mold show that the system maintains a nearly constant contact force and achieves stable layup quality across inclined surfaces of the mold. These results indicate that a mobile dual-arm manipulator can provide a cost-effective and adaptable alternative to traditional fixed-base layup solutions for composite manufacturing in flexible or variable production environments."

    "abstract": "Reliable microneedle guidance during subretinal injection remains a major clinical challenge. One of the reasons is that surgeons must infer the 3D position of the needle from a stereomicroscope that offers limited depth perception and from narrow B-scan iOCT cross-sections that cover only a fraction of the operative field. While spiral OCT scanning has been previously introduced for fast and continuous volumetric visualization of the surgical field, our work builds upon this technique by focusing on the development of a lightweight, geometry-based pose extraction framework. The proposed pipeline estimates the pose of the needle directly from the sparse 3-D point cloud generated by a single spiral OCT sweep containing just 2 000 A-scans (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\approx$</tex-math></inline-formula> 20 ms acquisition at 100 kHz). This reduction in A-scans shortens OCT acquisition time for needle tracking and, together with the elimination of pixel-wise segmentation and neural-network inference, slashes computational load and facilitates real-time deployment. A multi-pass RANSAC line fit exploits prior knowledge of needle geometry and trocar-constrained approach vectors to converge rapidly and reject outliers. Validation on <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ex vivo</i> porcine eyes demonstrates a median orientation error below <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${3.0}^{\\circ }$</tex-math></inline-formula> and a lateral tip error under 20 <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mu$</tex-math></inline-formula>m, with an end-to-end latency of 46 ms that supports pose updates beyond 20 Hz. Because each spiral volume produces a local point cloud, successive sweeps can be fused on-the-fly to yield a dense, continuously updated 3-D rendering of the needle and neighbouring retina in broader field. This live volumetric feedback lets surgeons see both instrument trajectory and local retinal topography at a glance, promoting safer needle advancement, more precise bleb placement, and earlier recognition of inadvertent tissue deformation than is possible with conventional 2-D en-face displays."

    "abstract": "In battery management systems, the ac bus-based modular equalizer, typically connected to a common ac link, enables fast and flexible power balancing. However, the reliance on synchronized control signals and dedicated communication links increases the wiring complexity. This article proposes a modular equalizer embedded with power line communication (PLC), leveraging the ac bus for simultaneous power and data transmission. Based on this, a distributed control scheme is proposed, where modular equalizers communicate via PLC to share state of charge and receive target power commands, while adjusting their power outputs based solely on local measurements. This scheme eliminates the need for synchronous drive lines and dedicated communication links, thus simplifying wiring and enhancing scalability. The stability of the distributed control strategy is proven, guaranteeing reliable power flow. Crosstalk analysis confirms tolerable mutual interference between power balancing and data transmission without functional degradation. Finally, experimental results from a four-equalizer prototype demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PLC-embedded modular equalizers."

    "abstract": "High-power 940-nm vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser arrays with different amounts of honeycomb-aligned VCSEL pixels usually serve as the carrier for the time-of-flight (ToF) applications. Under the pulsated ToF application at a relatively low DC bias, the demand of concurrent applications in free-space optical (FSO) transmission can be supported. To demonstrate the multiple functionalities of square-arrayed VCSELs, both non-return-to-zero on-off keying (NRZ-OOK) and quadrature amplitude modulation discrete multitone (QAM-DMT) formats are used to enable directly encoded FSO transmission. The maximum NRZ-OOK encoding data rates for the 1-/2-/2.5-Watt VCSEL arrays are 1.7/1.5/1.3 Gbps and 2.0/1.7/1.6 Gbps, respectively, to meet datacom and telecom standards. By changing the data format to the 4-QAM-DMT stream, the maximum data rates can reach 3.5/3.42/3.32 Gbps, respectively. A VCSEL array with more VCSEL pixels performs worse transmission but provides greater optical power. In addition, the VCSEL arrays operating beyond 1.4Ith exhibit higher transverse modes to degrade the QAM-DMT performance. For the 8-/16-/32-QAM-DMT transmission using the 1-Watt VCSEL array, the maximum data rates are obtained as 5.19/6.56/7.25 Gbps, respectively. These high-level QAM-DMT performances can surpass NRZ-OOK to explore the possibility of an FSO link using a typical high-power VCSEL array for lidar and ToF applications."

The obtained data demonstrate the feasibility of uniform plasma-assisted healing of cathode powders with high thermal efficiency (0.30–0.33 kWh/kg). These findings confirm that the proposed plasma-based regeneration process can achieve rapid and energy-efficient recovery of degraded cathode materials. The values of the main parameters are taken from the CFD-based heat balance (this work) rather than from experimental measurement; the sensitivity is ±0.03 kW h/kg to the carrier gas prehealing, powder, and powder specific heat."

    "abstract": "Function caching is one of the fundamental techniques in FaaS platforms to alleviate coldstart overhead. However, as cache instances consume significant cloud resources (e.g., memory), it is challenging to balance function performance and cache cost. Current systems use simple and rudderless cache polices with a “local cache control” design, which ignores function characteristics such as workload skewness from hot functions and results in either cache contentions or cache resource waste. <p xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">In this paper, inspired by software-defined networks, we propose <monospace>Flame</monospace>, an efficient cache system to manage cached functions with hotspot-aware instance scheduling and cache allocation. It consists of a two-layer design. Firstly, by decoupling the cache control plane from worker nodes and introducing a centralized cache controller, <monospace>Flame</monospace> can schedule functions from a global view of the cluster’s status, thereby reducing inter-node workload skew. Second, <monospace>Flame</monospace> divides the prior monolithic cache pool within each node into multiple partitions and dynamically assigns them to different hot functions, thereby further mitigating intra-node cache contention. Experimental results from realworld workloads show that <monospace>Flame</monospace> can reduce cache resource usage by 36% on average while improving function performance by nearly 7× compared to the state-of-the-art method.</p>"

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and tool use, making them promising candidates for autonomous agent applications. However, training LLM agents for complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in a lower bound of the multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for long-horizon planning tasks."

    "abstract": "Magnetic-core current transformers (CTs) are susceptible to high-frequency resonance during nanosecond-scale pulsed current measurements due to distributed parasitic elements, resulting in limited bandwidth and reduced accuracy. To address this issue, an optimized design approach based on segmented damping resistors is proposed. A PCB-based coplanar interwound structure is further introduced into a conventional magnetic-core CT with self-integration to enable precise damping configuration and reduce parasitic inductance, supporting the development of dynamic damping networks. Meanwhile, a distributed-parameter equivalent circuit model incorporating parasitic effects is constructed to elucidate the resonance suppression mechanism, where theoretical analysis establishes the relationship between segmentation and oscillation attenuation, and Simulink simulations are conducted to evaluate output behavior under varying segment counts. Furthermore, experimental tests using a square-wave excitation with a 20 ns rise time are carried out to compare undamped and segmented damping configurations, showing that high-frequency oscillations are effectively suppressed, with damping performance improving as the segment number increases. In particular, a 13-segment configuration reduces overshoot to 19.7%, achieving a 72.9% decrease compared to the undamped case. These results verify the effectiveness of segmented damping in mitigating high-frequency parasitic effects and offer a theoretical and engineering basis for the precision design of fast pulsed current measurement systems."

    "abstract": "In complex environments, achieving high-precision navigation and positioning for wheeled robots is challenged by cumulative errors in inertial navigation systems, low accuracy in zero-velocity detection, and significant sensitivity to environmental conditions. To address these issues, this study proposes an IMU-based inertial navigation method for wheeled robots that integrates adaptive wavelet denoising with a fused LSTM-KAN zero-velocity detection and update framework.Specifically, the wavelet decomposition levels and thresholding parameters are optimized using a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. A flexible thresholding function is introduced, which combines a Softplus envelope with a hard-threshold masking mechanism to effectively suppress non-stationary noise in IMU data, thereby enhancing signal stationarity and periodicity.Furthermore, a deep learning architecture incorporating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KAN) is developed to achieve robust recognition of the zero-velocity state, significantly improving the accuracy of zero-velocity updates (ZUPT). To mitigate inertial bias errors, the IMU is mounted at the center of the wheel, and a rotational modulation technique is employed to transform constant bias into sinusoidal components that can be removed through integration, thereby further enhancing system stability.Field experiments were conducted over three representative terrain types—flat roads, grassland, and rugged terrain—to evaluate the positioning accuracy of the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that, without relying on external vision systems or high-cost sensors, the proposed approach reduces inertial navigation errors by an average of 98.21%. The method exhibits high accuracy, robustness, and adaptability to diverse environments, offering an efficient and low-cost solution for autonomous navigation in GNSS-denied scenarios."

Second, an adapted K-means algorithm combined with analytical phase weighting is employed to rapidly generate candidate subarrays and perform beamforming. Finally, an efficient search algorithm is developed to identify a low-sidelobe solution.

    "abstract": "Traditional quantitative genetics rely on known pedigrees for estimating polygenic breeding values and variance components. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing, estimation of empirical relationships between individuals have become feasible. The single-step genomic BLUP procedure integrates polygenic and genomic information but requires intricate pedigree connections, leading to computationally demanding matrix operations. Here, we propose DYpREG, a flexible proximal operator multi-objective regularization method. DYpREG is a splitting algorithm that accommodates two distinct loss functions and a regularization function that can be chosen as LASSO, ridge regression (RR) or elastic net (EN). Notably, it incorporates pre-calculated breeding values without the need for extensive relationship matrix computations. Evaluated on two traits with different heritabilities from mice and pig, DYpREG with RR regularizer showed the best predictive performance compared to DYpREG with LASSO and EN regularizers as well as to all methods lacking polygenic information. The mean squared error (MSE) reduction was notable for both mice traits (1.5% and 24.77%) and both pig traits (2.8% and 2.1%). Comparative analyses with Bayesian reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and spike-and-slab (BayesC) regression also revealed consistent improvements. Hence, DYpREG effectively integrates polygenic information, enhancing prediction accuracy in genomic evaluations."

Compared to traditional stereo matching, learning-based stereo depth estimation provides a data-driven approach to infer dense and precise depth maps from stereo image pairs. However, these methods always suffer performance degradation in environments with sparse textures and lacking geometric constraints, such as the unstructured terrain of Mars. To address these challenges, we propose M<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>Depth, a depth estimation model tailored for Mars rovers. Considering the sparse and smooth texture of Martian terrain, which is primarily composed of low-frequency features, our model incorporates a convolutional kernel based on wavelet transform that effectively captures low-frequency response and expands the receptive field. Additionally, we introduce a consistency loss that explicitly models the complementary relationship between depth map and surface normal map, utilizing the surface normal as a geometric constraint to enhance the accuracy of depth estimation. Besides, a pixel-wise refinement module with mutual boosting mechanism is designed to iteratively refine both depth and surface normal predictions. Experimental results on synthetic Mars datasets with depth annotations show that M<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>Depth achieves a 16% improvement in depth estimation accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods in depth estimation.

However, for patient-side surgical assistants, existing systems lack intuitive and safe interaction strategies to mitigate preoperative infection risks and intraoperative collisions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a multifunctional proximity-aware skin that integrates multizone Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensing for interaction during both preoperative and intraoperative phases of AR-assisted telesurgery. On the patient side, a monocular camera providing AR visualization is mounted at the end of a robotic arm equipped with the skin. The skin uses a time-division multiplexing strategy to eliminate crosstalk and ensure reliable proximity awareness. During preoperative preparation, the skin-based contactless teleoperation allows surgical assistants to adjust the AR robotic arm for a high-quality field of view, while the contactless gesture recognition enables mode switching between rotation, translation, and locking. In the intraoperative phase, the skin facilitates obstacle avoidance to ensure patient-side safe assistance. Accuracy evaluations demonstrate effective crosstalk suppression under the proposed time-division multiplexing strategy. Functional experiments, laparoscopic phantom and tissue tests, as well as user studies validate the system's effectiveness to improve patient-side assistance."

This article proposes a novel AFTC framework with the goal of decoupling design for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems, thereby recovering the use of SP in AFTC design. An observer is developed for fault diagnosis and state estimation based on the system outputs, and the boundedness of the estimation errors is guaranteed. Next, an active fault-tolerant controller integrated with an adaptive mechanism is constructed for fault accommodation using the obtained fault information. To mitigate bidirectional influences between the observer and controller designs, all estimation errors and disturbances are treated as new disturbances in the AFTC system (AFTCS), and adaptive updating terms are designed to compensate for these disturbances. The stability of the AFTCS is analyzed, ensuring that all signals in the closed-loop system remain bounded and that the output tracking error converges to a neighborhood around zero. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated through a numerical simulation example."

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), increasingly deployed in sensitive environments like environmental monitoring and defense systems, are vulnerable to both accidental failures and intentional attacks. Existing anomaly detection methods—particularly those based on fixed statistical models or machine learning—often fall short in dynamic network settings where topological structure changes rapidly. Unlike prior work that primarily applied persistent homology to static graphs or coverage-hole detection, this paper introduces a dynamic, topology-aware anomaly detection framework that continuously tracks the evolution of Betti numbers in WSNs. By monitoring shifts in both connected components (Betti-0) and cycle structures (Betti-1), the method identifies anomalies caused by node or link disruptions. The novelty lies in employing temporal Betti number variations as lightweight, training-free indicators of network integrity, enabling early detection of both benign failures and malicious intrusions. The approach was evaluated using MATLAB simulations across dense and sparse topologies under multiple node failure scenarios. Results showed a detection rate of 95.4%, a false positive rate of 3.2%, and an overall accuracy of 96.8%, consistently outperforming statistical and learning-based baselines in dynamic WSN conditions."

    "abstract": "The success of collaborative task completion among networked devices hinges on the effective selection of trustworthy collaborators. However, accurate task-specific trust evaluation of multi-hop collaborators can be extremely complex. The reason is that their trust evaluation is determined by a combination of diverse trust-related perspectives with different characteristics, including historical collaboration reliability, volatile and sensitive conditions of available resources for collaboration, as well as continuously evolving network topologies. To address this challenge, this paper presents a graph neural network (GNN)-aided distributed agentic AI (GADAI) framework, in which different aspects of devices’ task-specific trustworthiness are separately evaluated and jointly integrated to facilitate multi-hop collaborator selection. GADAI first utilizes a GNN-assisted model to infer device trust from historical collaboration data. Specifically, it employs GNN to propagate and aggregate trust information among multi-hop neighbours, resulting in more accurate device reliability evaluation. Considering the dynamic and privacy-sensitive nature of device resources, a privacy-preserving resource evaluation mechanism is implemented using agentic AI. Each device hosts a large AI model-driven agent capable of autonomously determining whether its local resources meet the requirements of a given task, ensuring both task-specific and privacy-preserving trust evaluation. By combining the outcomes of these assessments, only the trusted devices can coordinate a task-oriented multi-hop cooperation path through their agents in a distributed manner. Experimental results show that our proposed GADAI outperforms the comparison algorithms in planning multi-hop paths that maximize the value of task completion."

A key component, Spatiotemporal Consistent Null-Text Optimization (SCNO), jointly models continuity across viewpoints and timestamps, mitigating inconsistencies in multi-frame editing. To further enhance fidelity, the Source-Attention-Guided Editing (SAGE) module leverages self-attention maps to preserve spatial structures, reuses cross-attention maps for semantic consistency, and aggregates multi-layer source attention to prevent unintended edits when target objects exit the scene. Building upon these components, we develop a round-by-round editing pipeline, enabling diverse local and global modifications—including semantic, stylistic, and attribute-based adjustments—while maintaining coherent dynamic scene structure. Extensive experiments on multi-view volumetric video datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves editing precision, semantic fidelity, and spatiotemporal consistency, outperforming state-of-the-art zero-shot methods and establishing a new benchmark for high-fidelity volumetric video editing."

    "abstract": "The increasing density of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) renders permanent faults and soft errors more prevalent, which critically reduces yield and reliability. Although error correction code (ECC) can mitigate this issue, existing ECCs are not optimized for fault correction. As a result, fault tolerance remains insufficient, and the error correction capability in the presence of faults is degraded. Therefore, to improve DRAM robustness by efficiently addressing both permanent faults and soft errors, this brief proposes a fault-aware adaptive on-die ECC (FADE) in which two ECC engines independently operate in either fault mode (FM) or error mode (EM) according to the number of faulty symbols (FSs). In FM, a fault polynomial is reconstructed by reusing the fault addresses that the built-in self-repair (BISR) stores in content-addressable memory (CAM). To calculate the corresponding fault magnitudes, a modified decoding equation is employed. As a result, the number of correctable FSs in FM doubles compared to the conventional ECC. Moreover, with the proposed symbol-based fault isolation, both fault tolerance and error correction capability in the presence of faults are drastically enhanced. Additionally, the experimental results show that the proposed design can be implemented with a reasonable overhead in terms of delay and area."

A unified framework and signal model are developed for detecting potential targets and tracking previously detected ones, even in arbitrary positions. Leveraging the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test technique, novel detection/tracking algorithms are proposed to handle unknown target responses and interference. Scalable AP-user and AP-target association rules are evaluated, explicitly considering multi-zone sensing scenarios. Additionally, a scalable power control mechanism extends fractional power control principles to ISAC, balancing power allocation between communication and sensing tasks. For benchmarking, a non-scalable power control optimization problem is also formulated to maximize the minimum user data rate while ensuring a Quality of Service constraint for sensing, solved via successive convex approximation. Extensive numerical results validate the proposed framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in both communication and sensing, revealing the impact of interference from other targets, and highlighting fundamental trade-offs between sensing and communication performance."

    "abstract": "As a critical geophysical parameter governing land-atmosphere interactions, soil moisture (SM) plays a pivotal role in regulating global water and energy cycles. Despite the proliferation of satellite-derived SM products, their utility in precision agriculture remains constrained by inherent limitations in spatial resolution and cross-regional generalizability. This study presents a novel machine learning framework that synergistically integrates multi-source earth observation data with in-situ measurements from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) to address these limitations. Leveraging the cloud-based computational capabilities of Google Earth Engine (GEE), we developed a high-resolution (60m) SM estimation model through systematically synergistic integration of Sentinel-2 multispectral reflectance, Sentinel-1 C-band SAR backscatter characteristics (VV, VH polarization, incidence angle) and ISMN ground measurements. The microwave-canopy interaction mechanisms were quantitatively characterized using the Michigan Microwave Canopy Scattering (MIMICS) model, informing the selection of optimal predictor variables from Sentinel-2 MSI spectral bands (B1-B8A, B9-B12) and SoilGrids texture parameters. A streamlined machine learning regression architecture was implemented, achieving optimized performance through feature importance analysis that identified clay content (32.98%) and sand content (28.25%) as dominant predictors. Validation across heterogeneous agricultural regions demonstrated robust performance (Bias < 0.05 cm³/cm³) in low-to-moderate moisture regimes (< 0.36 cm³/cm³), with systematic underestimation observed in saturated conditions. The operational pipeline generated monthly composite SM maps for Henan Province croplands (April 2018), establishing a transferable paradigm for global-scale high-resolution SM monitoring, particularly in low-stature crop environments (e.g., winter wheat). This methodology advances the synergistic use of microwave-optical-soil property data fusion and provides critical insights for extending the framework to other vegetation types."

    "abstract": "Handwriting brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that convert neural signals into handwriting hold promise for providing an intuitive communication avenue for individuals with paralysis. The literature has demonstrated that complex handwriting process involves multiple neural states, each of which contains a distinct encoding of motor parameters. However, existing motor decoding approaches mostly ignore the alternation of neural states, resulting in limited performance. This study proposes a state-dependent neural decoding framework (StateMoE), which explicitly models the transition process of multiple neural states in handwriting to enhance decoding performance. Specifically, the framework is constructed with a mixture of experts (MoE) architecture: 1) each expert serves as a candidate neural decoder that independently models a specific neural state; 2) state alternation is controlled by a recurrent router, which models the state transition process. In this way, StateMoE is capable of adaptively switching the neural decoders according to the incoming neural signals, thereby achieving state-dependent decoding. We evaluate StateMoE using intracortical neural recordings from the human motor cortex during an attempted Chinese character writing task. Experimental results show that StateMoE significantly enhances decoding accuracy, with a 6.92% improvement over existing methods. These findings highlight the effectiveness of StateMoE in decoding handwriting trajectories and its potential for BCIs toward complex motor tasks."

These factors undermine the effectiveness of Bayesian attack graphs and reveal the limitations of traditional security methods that rely on static assumptions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian attack graph method designed for large-scale, active intranet security assessments. It captures real-time intranet changes by extracting system audit logs and generates attack graphs with MulVAL, ultimately resulting in a time-spanning understanding of potential security risks. Furthermore, it identifies direct-risk paths by eliminating weak dependencies between actions and estimates the likelihood of action execution based on expectations, thereby substantially reducing the computational complexity of Bayesian security analysis. To validate the proposed method, this paper conducts dynamic threat modeling and quantitative security analysis on an enterprise intranet using logs from over 1,000 hosts. The results demonstrate that the proposed method not only provides internal network security risk values at any given time but also identifies specific and observable potential attack paths. Furthermore, this study provides a reference framework for prioritizing vulnerability remediation based on changes in internal network security conditions"

    "abstract": "Tensor canonical correlation analysis (TCCA) has garnered significant attention due to its effectiveness in capturing high-order correlations in multi-view learning. However, existing TCCA methods often underemphasize the characterization of individual structures and lack algorithmic convergence guarantees. In order to deal with these challenges, we propose a novel sparse TCCA model called STCCA-L, which integrates sparse regularization of canonical matrices and Laplacian regularization of multi-order graphs into the TCCA framework, thereby effectively exploiting the geometric structure of individual views. To solve this non-convex model, we develop an efficient alternating manifold proximal gradient algorithm based on manifold optimization, which avoids computationally expensive full tensor decomposition and leverages a semi-smooth Newton method for resolving the subproblem. Furthermore, we rigorously prove the convergence of the algorithm and analyze its complexity. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior classification performance of the proposed method. Notably, on the 3Sources dataset, it achieves improvements of at least 4.50% in accuracy and 6.77% in F1 score over competitors. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhudafa/STCCA-L."

To address these challenges, Coordinated Spatial Reuse (Co-SR) can potentially contribute to optimizing spectrum resource utilization. This mechanism is expected to enable simultaneous transmissions, thereby boosting spectral efficiency in dense environments and increasing the overall network performance. In this paper, we shed light on the performance of Co-SR for Wi-Fi 8 networks. For that, we propose an implementation of Co-SR aligned with ongoing Wi-Fi 8 standardization efforts. The evaluation is done on a Wi-Fi simulator, which allows us to study the performance of the proposed Co-SR mechanisms in relevant scenarios. The results obtained in a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) consisting of four APs show delay reduction with Co-SR ranging from 31% to 95% when compared to Distributed Coordination Function (DCF)."

    "abstract": "Due to the limited training samples in few-shot object detection (FSOD), we observe that current methods may struggle to accurately extract effective features from each channel. Specifically, this issue manifests in two aspects: i) channels with high weights may not necessarily be effective, and ii) channels with low weights may still hold significant value. To handle this problem, we consider utilizing inter-channel correlation to ensure that the novel model can effectively highlight relevant channels and rectify incorrect ones, thereby strengthening channel quality. Since the channel sequence is also 1-dimensional, its similarity with the temporal sequence inspires us to take Mamba for modeling the correlation in the channel sequence Based on this concept, we propose the Spatial-Channel State Space Modeling (SCSM) module for spatial-channel-sequence modeling to accurately extract effective features from each channel. In SCSM, we design the Spatial Feature Modeling (SFM) module to ensure the quality of spatial feature representations. We then introduce the Channel State Modeling (CSM) module, which treats channels as a 1-dimensional sequence and take mamba to capture the correlation between channels. Extensive experiments on the VOC and COCO datasets show that the SCSM module enables the novel detector to improve the quality of channel feature representations and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract": "Due to the variation of target electromagnetic characteristics with the bistatic synthetic aperture radar (BiSAR) observation angle and frequency, extended targets often appear as multiple discrete points in the imaging results, leading to a loss of structural information. Existing studies have not yet addressed this phenomenon, which can significantly impact the subsequent interpretation and analysis of BiSAR images. To clarify the imaging characteristics of BiSAR, this paper analyzes the morphology and distribution of targets in BiSAR imaging results, considering the electromagnetic scattering characteristics of typical targets, such as linear targets, plates, and dihedrals. Initially, the two-dimensional wavenumber relationship of typical targets is applied to directly derive the imaging morphology and distribution of linear targets in the BiSAR configuration through the wavenumber mapping of the envelope and phase. Next, using the imaging results of the linear target and applying a first-order Taylor approximation for wavenumber inversion, the imaging morphology and distribution of plates and dihedrals are derived. To improve the accuracy of the model in describing dihedrals, we update the scattering model of dihedrals under the BiSAR configuration, building upon the existing model. Additionally, by considering the coupling relationship between target size, BiSAR configuration, and imaging results, the variations in morphology and distribution of these three typical targets with configuration and target size are explored. Furthermore, based on the imaging characteristics of extended targets, the structural information of the targets is estimated, resulting in structured imaging outputs. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the accuracy of the derived imaging results and characteristics. This paper establishes the relationship between the BiSAR imaging principles and target scattering characteristics, and, for the first time, analyzes the morphology and distribution of extended targets in BiSAR imaging results. These insights enhance the interpretability of BiSAR images and lay the groundwork for more refined image interpretation."

Introduction: \"SAFEflowTM\" (SF) using real time flow measurement and feedback control, has been cleared by USFDA. We hypothesized that due to its architecture using video imaging there will be both benefits, and functional contrasts, with the behavior of legacy infusion pumps (LIPs). Methods: We conducted type-tests of critical metrics using AAMI [1] and IEC [2] standards together with computational simulations. Results were compared with claimed and measured performance of two widely-used LIPs. Results/Discussion: Across its rated flow range of 1-600 ml h-1, SF's measured flow performance was superior (95/95% confidence/reliability -4.3% to +4.5% mean flow rate accuracy) to claims of two LIP designs, Occlusion detection was more consistent and rapid across flow rates and requiring less user interaction. Conclusion: SF's infusion performance was superior with reduced weight, size, and low parts count compared to LIPs. Regulatory evaluation standards may require updating for this class of infusion device."

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements and research in small sea surface target detection for maritime SAR missions. Deep learning-based models facilitate accurate target detection and localization by transforming image or video frames into high-dimensional abstract representations, enabling effective detection in complex sea surface environments. However, challenges such as occlusion, blurring, and reflections on the sea surface significantly complicate small target detection. To address these challenges, this paper summarizes a range of effective approaches, including context information, multi-scale learning, anchor-free detection, super-resolution, attention mechanisms, and sample-oriented approaches. These approaches aim to enhance the performance of small target detection in applications such as uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV) and uncrewed supply vessels. Furthermore, this paper classifies small target datasets, providing a detailed overview based on their collection methods and application scenarios, while highlighting representative datasets.

This is crucial for applications in robotics, augmented reality, and indoor navigation. Despite advancements in such technology, creating datasets and frameworks for frequently changing indoor spaces within industrial settings remains challenging. Conventional datasets are small-scale, slow to collect, and rely on inefficient stationary devices, making them unsuitable for such environments. The proposed framework is designed to address these shortcomings and for practical application. It utilizes a LiDAR-based mobile mapping system for efficient data handling and employs a multiple-image query approach for robust localization. Additionally, the framework uses cluster-wise pose integration for multiple-image queries to address data sparsity and similarity problems in indoor localization. The results from experiments in diverse and challenging indoor spaces demonstrate that, even with extensive queries, the proposed method outperforms existing methods in localization accuracy, achieving robust performance with 96.5% of the estimated poses within a 1.0m error of the ground truth and an average error of 0.779m."

    "abstract": "Localization accuracy in dynamic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is degraded when moving objects violate the static-environment assumption. This paper proposes a dynamic Visual SLAM (VSLAM) method that integrates pseudo-semantic segmentation with weighted optimization to address the issue. First, an adaptive feature extraction module is designed, which establishes a Gaussian distribution model for intra-frame features and combines it with an inter-frame matching quality function to overcome the limitations of traditional feature extraction methods. Second, a depth-based pseudo-semantic segmentation method is proposed, where the K-means clustering algorithm is employed to perform clustering analysis on depth information, generating accurate dynamic object masks for precise exclusion of dynamic features. Finally, a weighted optimization model based on epipolar constraints is constructed. By calculating the distance from feature points to epipolar lines and assigning weights accordingly, the model suppresses interference from dynamic feature points while enhancing the contribution of high-confidence static feature points. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to ORB-SLAM3, the proposed method reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) of the Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by approximately 98.5% on the TUM dataset, while outperforming other existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of localization accuracy and robustness."

    "abstract": "The cascaded H-bridge (CHB) converter-based battery energy storage system (BESS) is a promising solution for large-capacity energy storage due to its modular architecture. However, the instantaneous power exchanged between the AC and DC sides generates a second harmonic current (SHC), which can degrade the lifespan of the BESS. To address this issue, this paper proposes a differential buck-based active power decoupling scheme that suppresses SHC without additional power semiconductors. The proposed scheme comprises two key components: a differential buck circuit designed on the AC-side of each H-bridge to provide a conduction path for SHC and a closed-loop control strategy for multi-battery clusters to ensure effective SHC suppression. Compared with conventional passive filtering schemes, the proposed scheme reduces the capacitance requirement while achieving superior SHC suppression performance, thus reducing the overall cost of CHB-based BESS. Moreover, adaptive SHC control strategies are developed to maintain effective SHC suppression under state-of-charge imbalance among battery clusters. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated through simulations and experiments."

    "abstract": "As mobile edge computing technology advances rapidly, latency-sensitive and resource-intensive applications are being offloaded to edge servers to enhance Quality of Service (QoS) for users. Traditional monolithic architectures, however, struggle to meet the escalating service and traffic requirements of distributed users due to their inherent inflexibility. In response to these challenges, microservices architecture, characterized by scalability and flexibility, has been adopted for dynamic deployment at the network edge. However, the deployment of these lightweight, dependency-rich components in a way that minimally impacts the makespan and maximizes quality of service is complex. Current studies often overlook the deployment of microservices with specific dependencies within constrained environments of edge server clusters and communication links. This paper introduces practical and effective strategies for the deployment and updating of microservices, tailored to various application contexts. Initially, two scenarios are analyzed: one constrained by bandwidth with unlimited storage, and the other by storage with unlimited bandwidth. For each scenario, optimal solutions are developed using a novel enhanced graph construction method. The study progresses to a more intricate scenario involving comprehensive constraints on storage, computation, and communication resources. An optimized deployment method is proposed, utilizing main path embedding followed by an innovative simulated annealing algorithm for iterative refinement. This method is validated by demonstrating that the main path coincides with the critical path. Furthermore, the dynamic reallocation of edge resources is explored through a critical path-based updating algorithm that optimizes microservice locations to reduce overall makespan. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our strategies outperform existing representative benchmark approaches in terms of overall performance and microservice deployment efficiency."

In this configuration, a vector summation technique is implemented within the array’s parallel feed network to allow the control of signal phase and magnitude by a reduced number of tunable phase shifters and control circuitry.

The phased array, controlled by eight analog and sixteen digital inputs, provides ±90° of continuous scan range with measured sidelobe levels of smaller than -8 dB within its 3-dB power gain bandwidth.

Several of such eight-element modules can be connected to form larger arrays. As a proof of concept, the performance of 16-element and 32-element arrays, created by connecting these modules, is tested, and their array factors are presented. Based on the results, the 16-element and 32-element arrays achieve a ±90° scan range with sidelobe levels below −9 dB at 24 GHz."

Here we highlight the physical properties of this never-before used spectrum for cellular by reviewing recent channel measurements for outdoor and indoor environments, including path loss, delay and angular spreads, and material penetration loss, all which offer insights that underpin future 5G/6G wireless communication designs. Building on the fundamental knowledge of the channel properties, we explore FR3 spectrum agility strategies that balance coverage and capacity tradeoffs, while examining coexistence with incumbent systems, such as satellites, radio astronomy, and earth exploration. Moreover, we discuss the potential of massive multiple-input multiple-output technologies, challenges for commercial deployment, and potential solutions for FR3, including multiband sensing for FR3 integrated sensing and communications. Finally, we outline 6G standardization features that are likely to emerge from 3GPP radio frame innovations and open radio access network developments."

The design introduces fully symmetric segmented planar coils with distributed series capacitors to equalize adjacent-turn potentials and suppress inter-turn capacitance at MHz, preserving a robust resonance. On the receiver, a symmetric multisecondary transformer is employed whose leakage inductance is reused as the series compensation element, removing a discrete inductor and improving magnetic integration. Each secondary feeds a dedicated gallium nitride (GaN) full-bridge synchronous rectifier, and the paralleled dc outputs naturally share extreme current without complex active balancing circuitry or control algorithms. A 3.13 kW prototype at 1 MHz delivers 24 V–127 A across a 100 mm air gap with 95.2% dc–dc efficiency (peak 96.2% at <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${\\boldsymbol\\sim}$</tex-math></inline-formula>70 A).

    "abstract": "The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) leverages Federated Learning (FL) for distributed model training while preserving data privacy, and meta-computing enhances FL by optimizing and integrating distributed computing resources, improving efficiency and scalability. Efficient IIoT operations require a trade-off between model quality and training latency. Consequently, a primary challenge of FL in IIoT is to optimize overall system performance by balancing model quality and training latency. This paper designs a satisfaction function that accounts for data size, Age of Information (AoI), and training latency for meta-computing. Additionally, the satisfaction function is incorporated into the utility function to incentivize IIoT nodes to participate in model training. We model the utility functions of servers and nodes as a two-stage Stackelberg game and employ a deep reinforcement learning approach to learn the Stackelberg equilibrium. This approach ensures balanced rewards and enhances the applicability of the incentive scheme for IIoT. Simulation results demonstrate that, under the same budget constraints, the proposed incentive scheme improves utility by at least 23.7% compared to existing FL schemes without compromising model accuracy."

    "abstract": "The intelligent development of high-speed railways (HSRs) necessitates support for various services to ensure safe and reliable train operations while providing high-quality travel experiences for passengers. Network slicing presents a promising solution via isolated and service-specific radio resource management. However, meeting heterogeneous quality of service (QoS) requirements in HSR communications is particularly challenging due to imperfect channel state information (CSI) caused by high-speed mobility. In this work, we investigate a slicing puncture strategy in a moving network with an imperfect train-to-ground downlink, supporting passenger entertainment and safety-related services. The system includes two transmission links: outboard and inboard. Given the impact of high-speed mobility, we characterize the statistical probability distribution of the actual CSI and model the average transmission rates in the outboard link. We aim to minimize the system Resource Block (RB) and power in the above two links while satisfying the diverse QoS requirements of services. Since the resource minimization problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming, we decompose it into three subproblems: RB allocation, power allocation, and slicing puncture optimization. A Speed-Aware Resource allocation and Slicing puncture (SA-RS) algorithm is proposed. Specifically, analytical expressions are derived for RB allocation, and a bisection-based algorithm is designed for power allocation. Moreover, the slicing puncture strategy is obtained using a genetic-based algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can improve the system performance compared with other baseline schemes under imperfect CSI."

    "abstract": "Coherent optical communication technology stands as a thriving research domain in modern communication. In pursuit of higher spectral efficiency, extensive research has been conducted on high-order modulation and broadband transmission technologies. However, these advancements are highly sensitive to transceiver in-phase/quadrature (IQ) skew impairments, posing a significant task of estimation and compensation for transceiver IQ skew. In this paper, an effective approach based on a specially designed training sequence (TS) to simultaneously estimate both transmitter-side and receiver-side IQ skew (Tx/Rx-skew) for coherent orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems is proposed, in which the TS is highly reusable and holds the potential for reducing the system overhead. Furthermore, the designed TS is also robust to the sampling frequency offset (SFO) and has the capacity to estimate the SFO. The effectiveness of the proposed joint transceiver IQ skew and SFO estimation scheme is verified by simulation in a dual-polarization coherent OFDM system. The results indicate that the proposed scheme can offer the joint estimation for SFO and transceiver IQ skew with the estimation errors below 2ppm and 0.2ps, for the range of [-500, 500] ppm and [-1.8<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</i>, 1.8<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</i>] accordingly."

    "abstract": "Precoding techniques, particularly linear precoding, are widely employed in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Although well-studied in the literature, linear precoding design still faces two fundamental challenges: high computational complexity and the lack of a general design approach. This paper presents an efficient and unified framework for linear precoding design in downlink multiuser systems that accommodates diverse criteria, such as weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization and weighted symbol error rate (WSER) minimization, while ensuring quality of service (QoS) requirements. The proposed framework achieves an order-of-magnitude reduction in per-iteration computational complexity compared to existing methods. In particular, by accurately characterizing the feasible signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) region, we transform the high-dimensional precoding design problem into a more manageable, low-dimensional SINR allocation problem. We propose an efficient SINR-based precoding (SBP) framework that employs a water-filling solution at each iteration, without the need for matrix inversion. The proposed framework can be extended to broadcast and interference channels with multi-antenna users under pre-fixed receivers. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves near-optimal performance while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to existing methods, such as the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) method."

A real-time virtual replica of the drone enables precise control, trajectory optimization, and feedback. A 224 cm × 224 cm arena with ArUco markers defines the coordinate system, while an overhead camera and OpenCV provide vision-based localization. The ESP32-controlled drone uses the YOLOv11-nano model for obstacle detection and a lightweight transformer model, Depth Anything (Lihe-Young-small-hf), for monocular depth estimation—eliminating the need for LiDAR or stereo sensors. Detected obstacles are mapped into a 3D grid for Dijkstra-based path planning. Real-time synchronization between the physical drone and its digital twin is achieved via MQTT within a ROS2–Gazebo environment. The proposed DT system achieves an RMS trajectory deviation of approximately 0.015 m, representing an order-of-magnitude improvement compared with DT–based UAV navigation studies under similar experimental conditions and maintains stable detection accuracy (mAP ≈ 0.994) throughout the manoeuvre. The proposed system offers a scalable, low-cost solution for indoor UAV autonomy with potential applications in warehouse automation, disaster management, and intelligent surveillance."

    "abstract": "The Strapdown Inertial Navigation System (SINS)/electromagnetic log (EM Log) integrated navigation system is widely employed on surface vessels and submarines. However, the EM Log measures only the fore-and-aft velocity of the vehicle relative to seawater, which is different from the vehicle’s true velocity direction due to the influence of pitch, roll, and sideslip, thereby degrading navigation accuracy. To address this issue, this paper proposes a motion-constrained SINS/EM Log integrated navigation method. This method uses the motion characteristics of marine vehicles to establish appropriate constraint conditions. Subsequently, constraint equations are formulated to reconstruct the sway and heave velocities that cannot be measured by the EM Log, as well as using the acceleration and heading rate to identify the turning maneuver and then correct the sideslip. The installation misalignment angles between SINS and EM Log are augmented to the state vector of the Kalman filter with regard to their negative effects on constraint conditions, and the error equations with SINS misalignment angles and EM Log installation misalignment angles under motion constraints are derived. The final results of simulation and experiment demonstrate that, compared with the augmented dimension method, the proposed method effectively suppresses the velocity error during the turning maneuvers and improves the overall system performance."

    "abstract": "The preponderance of traffic accidents takes place within urban intersection areas. It is crucial to extrapolate accident risk maps specifically for these locations to proactively mitigate and prevent future occurrences of traffic accidents. Nevertheless, inferring fine-grained intersection risk remains a challenging task, primarily due to the intricate structure of the road network, variability in scene information, and the stringent requirements for high-quality data. In this work, we propose an end-to-end Adaptive Risk-Feature Aware Fusion Network (ARFAF-Net) based on multimodal data to achieve fine-grained inference of traffic risk maps in intersection areas. Specifically, we introduce a Heterogenous Feature Adaptive Fusion Module to extract complementary features of risk from satellite imagery and streetscape data. The Dynamic Correlation Analysis Module is used to capture large-scale changes in risk in the region to improve multi-scale information perception. In addition, the Macro-Aware Guided Fusion Module is used to introduce macro-satellite image data features to enhance the accuracy of perceiving risks at the periphery of intersections. Ultimately, pixel-level extrapolation maps of intersection crash risk are generated, thereby offering more cost-effective and rational guidance for crash prevention. Both quantitative evaluation and qualitative analysis on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed ARFAF-Net achieves superior performance.

However, the consistency analysis of postarc sheath evolution in series-connected breaks with grading capacitors has drawn little attention in previous studies. This article focused on the dynamic development of postarc currents in series-connected vacuum interrupters (VIs) with various grading capacitor patterns. The concept of series-connected sheath consistency was introduced to quantitatively characterize the postarc sheath enhancement effect in series-connected VIs with SSCP, and the particle-in-cell (PIC) computational model was established. Furthermore, the influence of series-connected breaks, shield potential, and contact distance on postarc sheath evolution was investigated, which indicated that SSCP could affect the evolution process of postarc currents, sheath potential, and sheath thickness. Compared to conventional grading capacitor patterns (CGCPs), the postarc current peak was reduced by 20%. The maximum value of the consistency coefficient of SSCP is 0.20 (the ideal value is 0) in series-connected breaks. This article could be used for the evaluation of postarc sheath evolution consistency of series-connected SSCP, which promotes the advancement of ultrahigh-voltage multibreak tank VCBs."

    "abstract": "In radiometric measurements, the emissivity of natural objects exhibits a dependence on the viewing angle. Ignoring the angular effect of surface emissivity can increase the uncertainty of land surface temperature (LST) retrievals. To mitigate this issue, we evaluated the simulation performance of 11 parametric kernel-driven models (KDMs) and developed directional emissivity models using MYD21 and MYD03 products. Afterward, the directional and classification-based emissivities were input into the refined GSW algorithm to retrieve LSTs with and without considering angular effects (LST_GSW_DE and LST_GSW_CE, respectively). Coupled with the MYD21 LST product (LST_TES), three LSTs were evaluated via SURFRAD in situ data and ERA5-Land products. The main findings were as follows: (1) The RMSEs of directional emissivity simulated by different KDMs ranged from ˜0.0003 to ˜0.001, and their performance differences were generally slight, indicating that parameterized KDMs demonstrate reliable simulation performance in satellite-based directional emissivity modeling. (2) The directional emissivity simulation performances of different KDMs were ranked as follows: dual-kernel model (with both hotspot and base shape kernels) ≥ multikernel model > single-kernel model. The USEA and GUTA-sparse models exhibited advantages over the other KDMs when simulating impervious surfaces during the daytime. (3) We evaluated the three types of retrieved LSTs via SURFRAD in situ data. The rankings of the RMSE and MBE values were consistent: LST_TES was optimal, followed by LST_GSW_DE and LST_GSW_CE, with average RMSEs of 2.47 K, 2.62 K, and 2.80 K, respectively. Furthermore, we evaluated the three types of retrieved LSTs against the ERA5-Land data, and the rankings of the RMSE and MBE values were also consistent: LST_TES was comparable to (slightly better than) LST_GSW_DE in some seasons and consistently better than LST_GSW_CE. The average RMSEs were 2.45 K, 2.52 K, and 2.60 K. In addition, the RMSE and MBE values at different VZAs for the three LSTs increased with increasing VZA, especially when the VZA was greater than 40°. The results demonstrated that it is feasible to use KDMs to simulate directional emissivity from satellite data, offering theoretical interpretability and addressing the issues of discrete and missing emissivity data. Future studies could be devoted to establishing new KDMs or kernels that conform to different land surface and solar illumination conditions to improve the LST retrieval accuracy."

    "abstract": "Thermal analysis is increasingly critical in modern integrated circuits, where non-uniform power dissipation and high transistor densities can cause rapid temperature spikes and reliability concerns. Traditional methods, such as FEM-based simulations, offer high accuracy but are computationally prohibitive for early-stage design, often requiring multiple iterative redesign cycles to resolve late-stage thermal failures. To address these challenges, we propose ‘<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2D-ThermAl</i>’, a physics-informed generative AI framework that effectively identifies heat sources and estimates full-chip transient and steady-state thermal distributions directly from input activity profiles. ThermAl employs a hybrid U-Net architecture enhanced with positional encoding and a Boltzmann regularizer to maintain physical fidelity. Our model is trained on an extensive dataset of heat dissipation maps for over 200 circuit configurations, ranging from simple logic gates (e.g., inverters, NAND, XOR) to complex designs, generated using COMSOL and Cadence EDA flows. The dataset captures diverse activity patterns, and we note that material-dependent thermal properties may require targeted fine-tuning to ensure accuracy across different fabrication contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that 2D-ThermAl provides precise temperature mappings for large circuits, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of only 0.71°C and outperforms conventional FEM tools by running up to ∼ 200× faster. We analyze performance across diverse layouts and workloads and discuss its applicability to large-scale EDA workflows. Although thermal reliability assessments often extend beyond 85°C for post-layout signoff, our focus here is on early-stage hotspot detection and thermal pattern learning. To ensure generalization beyond the nominal operating range (25−55°C), we additionally performed cross-validation on an extended dataset that spans 25−95°C, maintaining a high accuracy (< 2.2% full-scale RMSE) even under elevated temperature conditions representative of the peak power and stress scenarios. Limitations such as 2D-only modeling and real-world validation are addressed with concrete future directions, including 3D extension, generalization across technology nodes, and transfer learning strategies. The code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/soumyadeepchandra/2D-ThermAl."

    "abstract": "To achieve higher voltage gains, cubic converter configurations are particularly valuable in photovoltaic (PV), battery chargers, and fuel cell applications where large voltage mismatches need to be bridged efficiently for direct integration with micro-inverters. Existing DC-DC cubic converters are typically employed to step up the voltage to the required levels; however, they often necessitate a high component count and operate at elevated duty cycles. This paper proposes a novel enhanced cubic step-up (NECS) DC-DC converter suitable for PV or fuel cell fed applications, capable of achieving high voltage gain with a reduced duty ratio and minimal component count. The proposed NECS DC-DC converter incorporates a hybrid active switch inductor (HASL) and a switched capacitor (SC) structure to enhance voltage conversion efficiency and minimize voltage stress across the power switches (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Q</i><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Q</i><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>). The converter’s operating principles are analytically derived, and its dynamic performance is assessed using the K-factor methodology. A laboratory prototype rated at 400 V, 50 kHz, and 250 W has been developed to experimentally validate the theoretical findings. The prototype achieves a voltage gain of 12.96 at a 45.6 % duty cycle with a peak efficiency of 95.8 %, demonstrating the converter’s effectiveness and suitability for high-gain, low input voltage applications and further integration to micro-inverters."

    "abstract": "Sharing relational databases is essential in today’s data-driven world for fostering collaboration, enhancing efficiency, and enabling real-time data access. However, privacy and copyright issues arise when sharing privacy-sensitive or valuable data. Additionally, high utility is required in shared data to enable accurate data mining and analysis. Entry-level differentially private fingerprinting schemes (DPFS) could address these concerns. In a DPFS, data can be securely shared without leaking original values while still supporting accurate analysis. Moreover, detectable fingerprints can deter unauthorized redistribution. However, existing DPFSs often lack utility—due to format changes and entry-wise bias—or robustness, as fingerprints can be removed undetected. In this paper, we propose an unbiased and robust differential privacy-based fingerprinting scheme (DPFS), which ensures that the fingerprinted copy remains an unbiased estimate of the original data. By incorporating differential privacy noise, our scheme effectively mitigates alteration, collusion, and hybrid attacks. Our DPFS satisfies ϵ-entry-level differential privacy, enabling clients to conduct unbiased analysis. To improve robustness, we design group-based fingerprint detection, which estimates the mean of injected noise per group with error tolerance. We provide a theoretical robustness analysis and propose a method for achieving optimal robustness. Experiments on four real-world databases show that our scheme consistently detects fingerprints and improves accuracy by up to 20% on machine learning tasks compared to existing DPFSs."

    "abstract": "Current adversarial attacks pose a serious threat to the robustness of visual-language models (VLMs), including vision-language pre-trained models (VLPMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Traditional adversarial attacks are example-specific and rely on specific datasets. This practice suffers from low transferability and additional computation cost, while universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) offer example-agnostic solutions by generalizing across inputs. However, current UAP methods mainly target VLPMs, demonstrating limited transferability and effectiveness in MLLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the Recursive Perturbation Attack (RPA), a novel black-box UAP method for both VLPMs and MLLMs. RPA employs a recursive perturbations strategy, utilizing token filtering and polynomial sampling methods to generate perturbations, thereby achieving incremental disruption and enhancing the transferability of the attack. To further enhance the effectiveness of the attack, RPA integrates a three-tier modality decoupling strategy, disentangling intra-modal, cross-modal, and fusion-modal features to effectively disrupt feature alignment and interactions. Extensive experiments validate that RPA achieves superior attack performance compared to existing UAP approaches. This work highlights new security concerns in multimodal AI systems and provides insights into the design of more robust models. Code is available at https://github.com/chilljudaoren/RPAttack."

The multi-step feedback mechanism increases the effective feedback depth and memory capacity of the reservoir, enabling richer temporal processing while permitting a substantial reduction in neuron count. In a 40-km IMDD link the proposed RC achieves a 2 dB improvement in receiver sensitivity to single-step feedback mechanism. For longer transmission ≥ 60 km, the proposed architecture outperforms the conventional single-step-feedback RC with markedly fewer reservoir neurons, thereby reducing implementation and computational complexity. These properties indicate that the proposed multi-step-feedback RC is a promising candidate for equalization in short-reach optical transmission systems."

    "abstract": "This study addresses the increasing demand for intelligent and context-aware automation in complex environments by introducing a perception-driven control framework designed to tackle operational uncertainties, heterogeneous terrain conditions, and spatiotemporal variability. Conventional autonomous control systems in dynamic and semi-structured domains often rely on rigid architectures or static policy representations, which restrict their adaptability to environmental changes and multi-phase task requirements. Furthermore, these systems frequently exhibit limitations in handling sensor noise, occlusion, and terrain-dependent constraints due to insufficient modularity and inadequate multi-scale reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose an integrated framework combining the Field-Adaptive Perception-Control Encoder (FAPCE) and the Contextually Guided Adaptive Modulation (CGAM) system. FAPCE utilizes a hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture to integrate multi-resolution sensory data, spatial field maps, and temporal sequences, enabling precise low-level control commands. CGAM incorporates semantic field classification, phase-aware control adaptation, and uncertainty-aware decision modulation to dynamically adjust control outputs based on contextual information. This approach facilitates real-time policy switching, smooth control transitions, and effective coordination among multiple agents, enhancing robustness in variable and unpredictable conditions. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets show that our method achieves an average accuracy of 92.17% and an F1 score of 90.90%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines such as Swin Transformer and EfficientNet by 2.3% and 4.2%, respectively. Under sensor perturbations and partial modality loss, the proposed system maintains over 89% F1 score, confirming its robustness. On embedded platforms such as NVIDIA Jetson Xavier, real-time inference is sustained at 17.8 FPS with a 23W power envelope, supporting practical deployment. These results demonstrate that our system significantly improves coverage efficiency, safety compliance, and task execution continuity across diverse agricultural and semi-structured environments. The proposed method contributes to advancements in task-aware and semantically grounded control systems, offering strong potential for adaptive automation in sensor-rich, safety-critical real-world domains."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of the internet of electric vehicles (IoEV) and the advancement of electric vehicle (EV) charging technology are transforming energy management for both residential and commercial users. Vehicle-to-building (V2B) energy trading is emerging as a groundbreaking approach that incorporates the exchange of energy between EVs and buildings. Despite the fact that V2B energy trading is able to reduce energy costs, main-grid complexity, and greenhouse gas emissions, it faces challenges when it comes to cooperative decision-making, resource efficient computation, and user transaction security. To address these challenges, this study aims to enhance energy exchange efficiency and dynamic energy interactions with enhanced security in urban environments. With these objectives, this paper proposes a novel energy trading method that integrates transfer learning (TL) and blockchain technology. TL makes it possible to adapt the knowledge gathered from vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) systems to V2B settings, which reduces the computational resources required and boosts the overall efficiency. Blockchain technology, on the other hand, provides a secure framework for transaction verification while granting users enhanced control over their data privacy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed technique using detailed simulations conducted with real-world data. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed approach improves the convergence speed by around 50% compared to training from scratch, while buildings achieve up to 38% higher profits relative to scenarios without our proposed strategy. We also simulate the system model using the Ethereum blockchain platform to determine its real-world feasibility. These experiments demonstrate that the system has the potential to facilitate efficient energy trading to ensure user security and economically beneficial transactions."

    "abstract": "In recent years, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a promising methodology to automate the design of deep neural networks, enabling the discovery of high-performing architectures across a wide range of tasks. Due to the high computational cost associated with NAS, several benchmarks have been introduced to support the development and evaluation of NAS methods. However, existing benchmarks are often limited in scope, typically relying on small-scale datasets or narrow search spaces, mostly based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) only. To address these limitations we introduce HyViTas-Bench, a novel NAS benchmark specifically tailored for hybrid CNN-Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures. HyViTas-Bench contains 6,561 unique models trained three times on a reduced, yet large scale, version of ImageNet-1k, offering an evaluation setting that better reflects realistic data. Each architecture is evaluated on 19 hardware platforms (CPU, GPU, and edge devices) for latency measurements, while robustness is validated through repeated training. We also provide an analysis of Out-of-Distribution (OoD) generalization using three external datasets. HyViTas-Bench enables a multifaceted assessment of NAS methods in terms of accuracy, latency, generalization capability, and model size. As such, it represents a valuable resource for advancing research on hybrid architectures and for facilitating the design and comparison of NAS strategies under more realistic and diverse evaluation criteria."

We demonstrate the effectiveness of these variants by applying them to the ResNet18, DenseNet and ConvNext architectures to validate their versatility and impact. Our study shows that incorporating a TripSE block in these CNN models boosts their performances, particularly for the ConvNeXt architecture, indicating its utility. We evaluate the proposed mechanisms and associated models across four datasets, namely CIFAR100, ImageNet, FER2013 and AffectNet datasets, where ConvNext with TripSE achieves state-of-the-art results with an accuracy of 78.27% on the popular FER2013 dataset, a new feat for this dataset."

    "abstract": "Multi-modal vehicle trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving in dynamic environments. Despite the significant progress in the field, the uncertainty and heterogeneity caused by the diversity in driving intentions and driving scenes still present major challenges to multi-modal prediction. Existing query-based prediction paradigms take into account the social context arising from the driving scene, but neglect priors regarding vehicle intentions that the historical trajectory may contain. We propose a Social-aware Water-wave Information Transmission Recurrent Acceleration Network, abbreviated as S-WITRAN, based on decoupling multi-modal prediction into an ego-aware and a social-aware learning stage. The ego-aware stage aims to relax the constraints from the driving scene to explore a diversity of future trajectory candidates. The social-aware stage aligns the candidates with respect to the social context arising from the driving scene. The information transmission is designed to extract from the vehicle’s historical trajectory priors about its possible intentions and dynamic states, which are integrated to form a multi-modal set of trajectories. Extensive experiments on the NGSIM, highD, and Argoverse2 datasets, as well as a benchmark evaluation in UniTraj, demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model in both map-free and map-based datasets."

    "abstract": "The control of the lower limbs is essential to activities of daily living like walking and balancing, which are fundamental indicators of health linked to fall risk and mortality. Despite its importance, there exist few methods that quantify lower limb control. This study evaluated whether the variability of fifteen-second circular leg movements relates to lower limb control, as assessed by a footedness questionnaire, and whether it also reflects functional performance in a postural balance task. Twenty-five healthy participants performed circular movements with their left and right legs, and they also completed one-legged stance trials on a force plate. Sway area and sway velocity were used as postural stability metrics. We found a linear relationship between each leg’s acceleration variability and its log-transformed sway area and sway velocity. Moreover, across three repeated measurements per limb, circular acceleration variability was more reliable than the sway area and sway velocity as it had the largest intra-class correlation coefficient. Furthermore, the lateral difference between the left and right leg’s acceleration variability was linearly related to the revised Waterloo Footedness Questionnaire’s score. Together, these findings suggest that the variability of circular leg movements provides a robust and functional assessment of the lower limb’s lateralization and postural stability."

    "abstract": "Despite remarkable progress, automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems typically lack the transparency required for high-accountability applications. Motivated by how human experts perform forensic speaker comparison (FSC), we propose a speaker verification network with phonetic interpretability, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">PhiNet</i>, designed to enhance both local and global interpretability by leveraging phonetic evidence in decision-making. For users, PhiNet provides detailed phonetic-level comparisons that enable manual inspection of speaker-specific features and facilitate a more critical evaluation of verification outcomes. For developers, it offers explicit reasoning behind verification decisions, simplifying error tracing and informing hyperparameter selection. In our experiments, we demonstrate PhiNet's interpretability with practical examples, including its application in analyzing the impact of different hyperparameters. We conduct both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the proposed interpretability methods and assess speaker verification performance across multiple benchmark datasets, including VoxCeleb, SITW, and LibriSpeech. Results show that PhiNet achieves performance comparable to traditional black-box ASV models while offering meaningful, interpretable explanations for its decisions, bridging the gap between ASV and forensic analysis."

    "abstract": "Traditional quantitative genetics rely on known pedigrees for estimating polygenic breeding values and variance components. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing, estimation of empirical relationships between individuals have become feasible. The single-step genomic BLUP procedure integrates polygenic and genomic information but requires intricate pedigree connections, leading to computationally demanding matrix operations. Here, we propose DYpREG, a flexible proximal operator multi-objective regularization method. DYpREG is a splitting algorithm that accommodates two distinct loss functions and a regularization function that can be chosen as LASSO, ridge regression (RR) or elastic net (EN). Notably, it incorporates pre-calculated breeding values without the need for extensive relationship matrix computations. Evaluated on two traits with different heritabilities from mice and pig, DYpREG with RR regularizer showed the best predictive performance compared to DYpREG with LASSO and EN regularizers as well as to all methods lacking polygenic information. The mean squared error (MSE) reduction was notable for both mice traits (1.5% and 24.77%) and both pig traits (2.8% and 2.1%). Comparative analyses with Bayesian reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and spike-and-slab (BayesC) regression also revealed consistent improvements. Hence, DYpREG effectively integrates polygenic information, enhancing prediction accuracy in genomic evaluations."

    "abstract": "Federated learning is a machine learning paradigm through training on locally private data and aggregating local models to generate a federated model. However, due to the heterogeneity problems (data heterogeneity and model heterogeneity), federated learning suffers from convergence difficulties and excessive aggregation overhead on decentralized participants. Additionally, federated learning faces privacy concerns during the aggregation of local models. To this end, in this work, we propose FEDINF, an efficient and secure inference with federated participants. Specifically, FEDINF features the following characteristics. FEDINF overcomes convergence challenges through federated inference instead of federated training, which reduces computation and communication overhead. Moreover, we design secure computation protocols and aggregation mechanisms to measure contributions, and handle both data and model heterogeneity without sacrificing privacy. Results of experimental evaluations on common datasets demonstrate that the proposed FEDINF outperforms the existing federated learning approaches in terms of efficiency and heterogeneity."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has transformed healthcare through improved disease prediction and diagnostic accuracy. However, the prediction of osteoporosis remains challenging due to limitations in current diagnostic methods, which are based on DXA scans and basic risk assessments that lack personalization and comprehensive integration of risk factors. This study employs machine learning techniques to predict osteoporosis using data from two sources—a Kaggle dataset and the NHANES dataset—each containing around 2,000 patients. The datasets were considered and formatted to include variables such as age, gender, weight, family history, lifestyle habits, and medical history, allowing for a comparative analysis. We used eight traditional machine learning methods and two deep learning models, CNN and RNN, along with a BERT transformer model. To enhance performance, we integrated Genetic Algorithms with the RNN model for parameter optimization. Our models were validated using a 10-fold cross-validation. The BERT model achieved the best performance, with 92% accuracy, 88% sensitivity, 96% specificity, and an AUC of 0.92 on the Kaggle dataset. It also demonstrated strong results on the NHANES dataset, which was originally imbalanced and was balanced using SMOTE. The RNN model initially performed poorly, but improved significantly when optimized with Genetic Algorithms, achieving an AUC of 0.932 and matching the overall performance of BERT. Our findings demonstrate that combining deep learning with evolutionary optimization techniques can significantly improve osteoporosis prediction accuracy, offering potential for early diagnosis and improved preventive care in bone health management."

    "abstract": "Smart meter data generated by Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) systems is vulnerable to false data injection attacks (FDIAs), which are often carried out by electricity thieves to lower their utility bills. Unsupervised electricity theft detection (ETD) methods aim to identify fraudulent users using only unlabeled data. However, existing unsupervised approaches struggle to effectively detect both power consumption reduction attacks and load profile shifting attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised ensemble method capable of detecting both types of attacks. The proposed method integrates three individual detection algorithms: two unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and a correlation-based detection algorithm using mutual information (MI). We apply a weighted combination strategy to aggregate the user anomaly degrees assessed by these algorithms, with weights determined based on their detection capabilities using K-means clustering. We conducted a performance evaluation using smart meter datasets from both business and residential users. Experimental results show that our ensemble approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness as a robust solution for unsupervised ETD."

Detailed, nonlinear analytical power harvest models for traditional CTMEHs have been presented and validated, such that designers can quickly predict and evaluate CTMEH performance without the need for intensive finite-element simulations. No existing power harvest model, however, has been presented for “hybrid” CTMEHs, which are composed of multiple concentric transformer cores of different materials. This paper presents and validates a power harvest model for hybrid, multi-core CTMEHs. Our proposed model is validated at a variety of primary current excitations for multiple, nanocrystalline/silicon steel hybrid harvesters, each with inhomogeneous cross sectional areas. The model agrees with experimental data throughout the unsaturated, soft saturated, and hard saturated operating regimes. This power harvest model is a tool to accurately predict the performance of hybrid CTMEHs, expediting the harvester design process and allowing for optimization of design parameters accordingly."

    "abstract": "6G non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) will use satellites for global internet access, where low earth orbit (LEO) satellites will be used frequently due to the lower latency and higher link budget that can be provided compared to higher altitude satellites. However, LEO satellites require many satellites due to their fast movement and limited coverage, leading to frequent handovers (HOs). This paper presents an intelligent LEO satellite conditional handover (ILCHO) scheme that improves the NTN performance by addressing the frequent HO issues while reducing the signal strength variation between cells and outdated measurement values. The ILCHO scheme derives the LEO satellite's state information (position and orbital path), which is used to obtain the conditions for a LEO satellite to be accessible to enable optimized target LEO satellite selection that will maximize the overall network service performance while minimizing the number of HOs. The ILCHO scheme uses multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to maintain an optimized performance through early preparation by incorporating a distance-based event in the execution phase. The simulation results show that the proposed ILCHO scheme can increase the throughput and signal to noise ratio (SNR) performance compared to other HO algorithms, thereby providng improved and more stable communication conditions."

    "abstract": "Distinguishing between self and other is fundamental for social interaction through touch and central to bodily self-awareness. Self-touch is known to feel different from being touched by others—typically perceived as less intense—but the underlying mechanisms behind this self-other difference remain a contemporary topic with crucial implications for robotics, virtual realities, and human-machine-interactions. Previous research has largely focused on the body part being touched, overlooking the role of the touching body part, which is equally vital in shaping the tactile experience. Here, we aimed to disentangle the two components of self-touch – touching and being touched – and compared them to other forms of active and passive touch. Across two experiments we examined subjective experience, neural activation, and physiological response using self-report and functional near-infrared spectroscopy. We show that the reduced intensity of self-touch is primarily driven by the touched area, while the touching hand mirrors responses seen in other active touch conditions. Receiving touch was rated as most pleasant, while self-touch was less pleasant than concurrent giving and receiving touch. At the neural level, we introduce novel k-shape clustering for functional near infrared spectroscopy. We found increased bilateral activity in temporal areas during self-touch in comparison to touching while being touched as well as when only receiving touch. Additionally, heartrate and heartrate variability differed between conditions. In conclusion, distinct behavioral and neural responses during self-touch demonstrate that self-touch is not simply a combination of simultaneous touching and being touched sensations and processing. Instead, it constitutes a unique sensory and neural phenomenon—highlighting its critical role in bodily self-representation and offering new insights into the multisensory foundations of self-other distinction."

The OSS problem is typically formulated as a mixed integer linear program, the solution of which relies on commercial solvers in current practice and is computationally intensive to achieve global optimality, hindering efficient exploitation of energy storage. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient and robust analytical solution method to achieve global optimality for OSSs. In this work, the OSS is formulated as a parametric program of the initial state of charge, and a recursive analytical solution algorithm (ASA) is devised to explicitly derive the optimal solution expressions within critical regions based on a forward-and-backward framework. The comprehensive simulation results show that the proposed ASA is substantially more efficient than prevalent solvers and solution methods and that it empirically exhibits linear scaling performance with increasing time horizons."

    "abstract": "Residential loads, with their substantial scale, rapid response speed, and flexible controllability, have become a crucial resource for demand side management. However, privacy concerns arising from data communication and the complexity of response strategies due to variations in customer flexibility present significant challenges to the effectiveness of demand response (DR) programs. To address these issues, this paper proposes a load management framework based on a multi-cluster mean-field (MCMF) game. Firstly, customer flexibility is quantified based on historical power consumption data, and an improved k-means algorithm is employed to cluster customers within the community. Then, considering each customer’s optimization objective to minimize the cost function including the electricity cost and the discomfort level, the problem is formulated as an MCMF game. Customers adjust their power consumption strategies according to the group-specific estimated electricity price, while the load aggregator (LA) collects total power consumption values and updates the price information iteratively until the optimal strategies of all customers converge to an ε-Nash equilibrium (ε-NE). Case studies involving 2000 customers with heterogeneous flexibility are conducted, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed framework compared with existing methods in peak shaving, electricity cost reduction, and computational efficiency."

    "abstract": "Dynamic stability refers to the ability of a magnetic actuation system to maintain equilibrium by damping oscillations. It is typically quantified by physical scalars that serve as critical indicators of both safety and effectiveness in real-world applications. Traditional real-time assessment methods often require measuring and calibrating task-specific parameters. While feasible in principle, these approaches are hindered in practice by procedural complexity, time consumption, measurement difficulty, and uncertainties inherent to the non-contact, non-rigid nature of magnetic actuation. In this work, we eliminate the need for parameter assumptions and direct measurements, enabling a more efficient and generalizable evaluation of dynamic stability. Our approach implicitly incorporates uncertain physical properties into a learning-based framework. Specifically, we propose a temporal difference policy that predicts dynamic stability by comparing multiple time-varying sequences, thereby reducing the influence of task-specific parameters. The robustness and effectiveness are validated through extensive experiments, including baseline comparisons and online implementations across diverse magnetically actuated objects. Our findings highlight its practical advantages and pave the way for innovative control strategies in precise magnetic actuation applications."

    "abstract": "The aspiration to replicate the capabilities of the human hand has driven innovations in the design of soft robotic hands. Despite these advancements, many existing designs of soft hands still lack effective in-hand vision and the ability for each finger to achieve active multi-degree-of-freedom motion. This paper proposes a cable-driven soft robotic hand that can achieve dexterous grasping and manipulation, vision-guided grasping, vision-based slip detection and compensation, as well as visually servoed in-hand manipulation. The hand has five soft fingers, each capable of independent flexion/extension motion and bidirectional ad/abduction motion. A red-green-blue-depth (RGB-D) camera is integrated into the palm of the soft hand to enable in-hand vision capability. Modeling of the soft hand is established to analyze its kinematics, statics, and manipulability. A series of experiments are conducted to demonstrate its dexterous grasping and manipulation capabilities on a variety of objects. Using 3D point cloud data from the in-palm camera, an effective vision-guided grasping strategy is developed to grasp objects on a table. The in-hand vision also enables slip detection and compensation during grasping to maintain the grasp stability. Furthermore, a hierarchical, visually servoed controller is developed to perform closed-loop in-hand object manipulation. With its high dexterity and visual feedback capabilities, the soft hand will find important applications such as household object manipulation and food picking/sorting, and may also be used as a prosthetic hand or an auxiliary hand for humans."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a neural implant system for prosthetic limbs that enables simultaneous multi-site data transmission via galvanically coupled body-channel communication (GC-BCC) for fine, low-latency control. Ultrasound and RF uplinks typically require multiple-access schemes to avoid collisions across implants. Capacitive BCC can support simultaneous links, but the small, motion-variant return-path capacitance reduces channel gain and undermines robustness. In contrast, GC-BCC forms a closed-loop current path for each transmitter.receiver pair via a dedicated termination, enabling simultaneous uplinks without multiple-access scheme. Implemented in 180-nm CMOS, the system integrates a 16-channel neural recording analog front end, a GC-BCC transceiver, and low-dropout regulators. Through 15-mm porcine tissue, the link sustains a 20-Mbps data rate with a bit-error rate below 1.3×105. Two GC-BCC transceivers operate simultaneously with 100-Ω termination with negligible crosstalk at ≥1.6-cm spacing. The measured energy efficiencies are 20.35 pJ/bit for the transmitter and 467.4 pJ/bit for the receiver."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a single input multiple output wireless power transfer system with constant voltages, which is suitable for multi-channel operating at different frequencies. Each channel can maintain constant-voltage output characteristics, leading the output voltage independency to the load variations at its designed frequency. Due to the cross-coupling between channels, an interference suppression approach is implemented by integrating notch networks to the compensation networks. A mathematical model is developed and the impact of cross-coupling between channels is systematically analyzed and incorporated as a key factor for the tuning of the multi-channel WPT system. The notch network and its corresponding supplementary impedances are introduced in each receiving channel to establish low-impedance transmission paths at the designed frequencies, effectively mitigating cross-interference. The conditions for constant voltage output are rigorously deduced. Experimental results demonstrate that under the condition of an input voltage of 80 V and a load variation range of 10 <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\Omega$</tex-math></inline-formula> to 40 <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\Omega$</tex-math></inline-formula>, the output voltages of Channel 1 and Channel 2 remain stable at 19.2 V with a fluctuation less than 6.2%. The multi-channel rotary steering system's efficiency can reach 83.92%. Compact design making it particularly suitable for power transfer in multi-channel rotary steering systems and space-constrained scenarios."

    "abstract": "Focusing on current sensor fault scenarios in dual three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor drives, this paper develops a fault-tolerant control scheme with optimized current sampling architecture. Firstly, to ensure the feasibility of stable motor operation, the required minimum number of current samples is analyzed. Then, the errors of phase currents estimation under different distributions are compared. Building on these insights, an orthogonal current sampling strategy is proposed to enhance fault-tolerant control capability. For the scenarios with broken-line fault and stuck fault, the motor can operate with single normal current sensor. Gain fault is inherently mitigated without algorithmic intervention. Zero-offset fault can be suppressed through different sampled fusion. The proposed fault-tolerant control algorithm avoids the use of observers and is independent of motor parameters. Experimental validation confirms the efficacy of the proposed fault-tolerant control framework, showing sustained motor stability across multiple fault scenarios."

    "abstract": "This letter addresses the joint air corridor planning and base station (BS) deployment problem for low-altitude integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. In the considered system, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operate within a structured air corridor composed of connected cubic segments, and multiple BSs need to be selectively deployed at a set of candidate locations to ensure both sensing and communication coverage throughout the corridor. In particular, we leverage the channel knowledge map (CKM) to characterize wireless channels for candidate BS sites prior to deployment, thereby facilitating the offline planning. Under this setup, we minimize the system cost in terms of the weighted sum of the air corridor length and the number of deployed BSs, subject to the constraints on both sensing and communication performance across the corridor. To solve the formulated large-scale nonconvex integer programming problem, we develop a hierarchical coarse-to-fine grid decomposition algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the benefit of the proposed joint design in reducing the overall deployment cost while ensuring the coverage of the low-altitude ISAC networks."

HyperGCN-DTI, a novel framework that explicitly advances beyond existing models such as CHL-DTI and HHDTI by leveraging hypergraph neural networks with a multimodal feature fusion strategy. While exsiting methods primarily focuses on low-order graph representations and fixed heterogeneous network structures, HyperGCN-DTI incorporates richer multimodal fused features including embeddings from pretrained language models and diverse biological networks and build robust hypergraphs that capture high-order multi-entity relationships within drug-target pairs. This dual-channel architecture effectively captures both local topological connections and higher-order structural dependencies. HyperGCN-DTI outperforms state-of-the-art DTI prediction models across multiple datasets and remains robust under imbalanced and large-scale real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior predictive power. The model demonstrates significant improvements when using multimodal features and hypergraph-based message passing, with sensitivity analysis confirming stability across hyperparameter variations. Top-ranked predictions are validated through biomedical literature and molecular docking, underscoring the reliability and practical relevance of our approach. HyperGCN-DTI is the first DTI prediction model to jointly integrate such a wide range of heterogeneous information sources with hypergraph representation, significantly enhancing accuracy and robustness, particularly in sparse or noisy settings. The proposed model offers a powerful and generalizable tool for accelerating drug development and target identification."

    "abstract": "The Earth’s surface is subject to complex and dynamic processes, ranging from large-scale phenomena, such as tectonic plate movements, to localized changes associated with ecosystems, agriculture, or human activity. Satellite images enable global monitoring of these processes with extensive spatial and temporal coverage, offering advantages over in situ methods. In particular, the resulting satellite image time series (SITS) datasets contain valuable information. To handle their large volume and complexity, some recent works focus on the use of graph-based techniques that abandon the regular Euclidean structure of satellite data to work at an object level. Graphs also enable the modeling of spatial and temporal interactions between identified objects, which are crucial for pattern detection, classification, and regression tasks. This article is an effort to examine the integration of graph-based methods in spatiotemporal remote sensing analysis. In particular, it aims to present a versatile graph-based pipeline to tackle SITS analysis. It focuses on the construction of spatiotemporal graphs from SITS and their application to downstream tasks. The article includes a comprehensive review and two case studies, highlighting the potential of graph-based approaches for land cover mapping and water resource forecasting. It also discusses numerous perspectives to resolve current limitations and encourage future developments."

    "abstract": "Scatterplots are widely used across various domains to identify anomalies in datasets, particularly in multi-class settings, such as detecting misclassified or mislabeled data. However, scatterplot effectiveness often declines with large datasets due to limited display resolution. This paper introduces a novel Visual Quality Measure (VQM) – OM4AnI (Overlap Measure for Anomaly Identification) – which quantifies the degree of overlap for identifying anomalies, helping users estimate how effectively anomalies can be observed in multi-class scatterplots. OM4AnI begins by computing anomaly index based on each data point's position relative to its class cluster. The scatterplot is then discretized into a matrix representation by binning the display space into cell-level (pixel-level) grids and computing the coverage for each pixel. It takes into account the anomaly index of data points covering these pixels and visual features (marker shapes, marker sizes, and rendering orders). Building on this foundation, we sum all the coverage information in each cell (pixel) of matrix representation to obtain the final quality score with respect to anomaly identification. We conducted an evaluation to analyze the efficiency, effectiveness, sensitivity of OM4AnI in comparison with six representative baseline methods that are based on different computation granularity levels: data level, marker level, and pixel level. The results show that OM4AnI outperforms baseline methods by exhibiting more monotonic trends against the ground truth and greater sensitivity to rendering order, unlike the baseline methods. It confirms that OM4AnI can inform users about how effectively their scatterplots support anomaly identification. Overall, OM4AnI shows strong potential as an evaluation metric and for optimizing scatterplots through automatic adjustment of visual parameters."

    "abstract": "Objective: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-guided robotic catheter interventions offer improved safety, visualization and control. Catheter actuation with current-carrying microcoils offers fast and responsive actuation without friction and backlash. However, actuation of this type of catheter leads to large void artifacts in MR images. We propose an interleaving method to reduce these artifacts without compromising the catheter's actuation capability. Methods: Interleaving is accomplished by synchronizing and interleaving catheter actuation and MR image acquisition at a high switching frequency using a TTL trigger from the MR scanner that triggers an Interrupt Service Routine in the catheter firmware. Reduction in catheter duty cycle is compensated using effective currents. Results: Image artifact analysis showed that there is not a statistically significant difference (at 0.05 significance level) between the artifacts associated with the catheter actuating with the proposed actuation-imaging interleaving and with the catheter at rest. Catheter trajectory tracking experiments showed that the error between pure actuation trajectories and interleaved actuation-imaging trajectories is generally within the error of the tracking algorithm. These results hold for both traditional MR imaging and accelerated imaging suitable for cardiac intervention. Conclusion: The proposed interleaving scheme effectively removes the artifact generated by current-carrying actuation coils while preserving the actuation capability of the catheter. The method can be used with an accelerated imaging sequence that is relevant for interventional imaging. Significance: The proposed scheme enables simultaneous/interleaved MR visualization and catheter actuation during intervention."
