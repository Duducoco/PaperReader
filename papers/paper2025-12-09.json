    "abstract": "Uplift modeling estimates the causal effect of an intervention as the difference between potential outcomes under treatment and control, whereas counterfactual identification aims to recover the joint distribution of these potential outcomes (e.g., \"Would this customer still have churned had we given them a marketing offer?\"). This joint counterfactual distribution provides richer information than the uplift but is harder to estimate. However, the two approaches are synergistic: uplift models can be leveraged for counterfactual estimation. We propose a counterfactual estimator that fits a bivariate beta distribution to predicted uplift scores, yielding posterior distributions over counterfactual outcomes. Our approach requires no causal assumptions beyond those of uplift modeling. Simulations show the efficacy of the approach, which can be applied, for example, to the problem of customer churn in telecom, where it reveals insights unavailable to standard ML or uplift models alone."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the optical properties of a black hole in non-minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills theory, illuminated by a thin accretion disk composed of free, electrically neutral plasma. In our setup, matter follows stable circular orbits outside the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), while inside the ISCO, it rapidly plunges into the black hole. We begin by analyzing the orbital dynamics of massive and massless particles around the black hole. Our results indicate that as the non-minimal coupling parameter increases, the radii of both the ISCO and the photon sphere, together with the corresponding energy and angular momentum for massive particles or the impact parameter for photons, decrease approximately linearly. Moreover, compared with the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordström black holes, the non-minimal coupling extends the range of the impact parameter and slightly enhances the redshift effect in the images. Additionally, due to the significant influence of the non-minimal coupling parameter on the event horizon, the observed intensity of the non-minimally coupled black hole image under the selected emission model ultimately turns out to be weaker than that of the other two types of black holes, regardless of the inclination angle between the accretion disk and observation planes."

    "abstract": "Personalizing visual generative models to meet specific user needs has gained increasing attention, yet current methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) remain impractical due to their demand for task-specific data and lengthy optimization. While a few hypernetwork-based approaches attempt to predict adaptation weights directly, they struggle to map fine-grained user prompts to complex LoRA distributions, limiting their practical applicability. To bridge this gap, we propose LoFA, a general framework that efficiently predicts personalized priors for fast model adaptation. We first identify a key property of LoRA: structured distribution patterns emerge in the relative changes between LoRA and base model parameters. Building on this, we design a two-stage hypernetwork: first predicting relative distribution patterns that capture key adaptation regions, then using these to guide final LoRA weight prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently predicts high-quality personalized priors within seconds, across multiple tasks and user prompts, even outperforming conventional LoRA that requires hours of processing.

These malicious smart contracts try to attack legitimate programs by exploiting its vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, tx.origin attack, bad randomness, deligatecall and so on. This may lead to drain of the funds, denial of service and so on . Hence, it is necessary to identify and prevent the malicious smart contract before deploying it into the blockchain. In this paper, we propose an ML based malicious smart contract detection mechanism by analyzing the EVM opcodes. After balancing the opcode frequency dataset with SMOTE algorithm, we transformed opcode frequencies to the binary values (0,1) using an entropy based supervised binning method. Then, an explainable AI model is trained with the proposed binary opcode based features. From the implementations, we found that the proposed mechanism can detect 99% of malicious smart contracts with a false positive rate of only 0.01. Finally, we incorporated LIME algorithm in our classifier to justify its predictions. We found that, LIME algorithm can explain why a particular smart contract app is declared as malicious by our ML classifier based on the binary value of EVM opcodes."

While numerical methods for finding GNE when players possess convex structure are relatively mature, the same cannot be said when players optimize nonconvex objective functions over nonconvex feasible regions. Drawing inspiration from the notion of a normalized (or variational) Nash equilibrium, which is a more restrictive class of solutions to generalized Nash games, we extend the ideas of Harwood et al. (\"Equilibrium modeling and solution approaches inspired by nonconvex bilevel programming.\" Computational Optimization and Applications, 87(2):641-676, 2024) to develop an exact method that can find a normalized Nash equilibrium (NNE) of a problem, when such an NNE exists. By adapting the framework of Harwood et al., we are able to find NNE without any convexity assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several nonconvex games."

    "abstract": "Agentic AI marks a major shift in how autonomous systems reason, plan, and execute multi-step tasks. Unlike traditional single model prompting, agentic workflows integrate multiple specialized agents with different Large Language Models(LLMs), tool-augmented capabilities, orchestration logic, and external system interactions to form dynamic pipelines capable of autonomous decision-making and action. As adoption accelerates across industry and research, organizations face a central challenge: how to design, engineer, and operate production-grade agentic AI workflows that are reliable, observable, maintainable, and aligned with safety and governance requirements. This paper provides a practical, end-to-end guide for designing, developing, and deploying production-quality agentic AI systems. We introduce a structured engineering lifecycle encompassing workflow decomposition, multi-agent design patterns, Model Context Protocol(MCP), and tool integration, deterministic orchestration, Responsible-AI considerations, and environment-aware deployment strategies. We then present nine core best practices for engineering production-grade agentic AI workflows, including tool-first design over MCP, pure-function invocation, single-tool and single-responsibility agents, externalized prompt management, Responsible-AI-aligned model-consortium design, clean separation between workflow logic and MCP servers, containerized deployment for scalable operations, and adherence to the Keep it Simple, Stupid (KISS) principle to maintain simplicity and robustness. To demonstrate these principles in practice, we present a comprehensive case study: a multimodal news-analysis and media-generation workflow. By combining architectural guidance, operational patterns, and practical implementation insights, this paper offers a foundational reference to build robust, extensible, and production-ready agentic AI workflows."

    "abstract": "In any ecosystem, the conditions of the environment and the characteristics of the species that inhabit it are entangled, co-evolving in space and time. We introduce a model that couples active agents with a dynamic environment, interpreted as a nutrient source. Agents are persistent random walkers that gather food from the environment and store it in an inner energy depot. This energy is used for self-propulsion, metabolic expenses, and reproduction. The environment is a two-dimensional surface divided into patches, each of them producing food. Thus, population size and resource distribution become emergent properties of the system. Combining simulations and analytical framework to analyze limiting cases, we show that the system exhibits distinct phases separating quasi-static and highly motile regimes. We observe that, in general, population sizes are inversely proportional to the average energy per agent. Furthermore, we find that, counter-intuitively, reduced access to resources or increased metabolic expenditure can lead to a larger population size. The proposed theoretical framework provides a link between active matter and movement ecology, allowing to investigate short vs long-term strategies to resource exploitation and rationing, as well as sedentary vs wandering strategy. The introduced approach may serve as a tool to describe real-world ecological systems and to test environmental strategies to prevent species extinction."

    "abstract": "Non-invasive measurements of the human brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have significantly improved our understanding the brain's network organization by enabling measurement of anatomical connections between brain regions (structural connectivity) and their coactivation (functional connectivity). Heritability analyses have established that genetics account for considerable intersubject variability in structural and functional connectivity. However, characterizing how genetics shape the relationship between structural and functional connectomes remains challenging, since this association is obscured by unique environmental exposures in observed data. To address this, we develop a regression analysis framework that enables characterization of the relationship between latent genetic contributions to structural and functional connectivity. Implementing the proposed framework requires estimating genetic covariance matrices in multivariate random effects models, which is computationally intractable for high-dimensional connectome data using existing methods. We introduce a constrained method-of-moments estimator that is several orders of magnitude faster than existing methods without sacrificing estimation accuracy. For the genetic regression analysis, we develop regularized estimation approaches, including ridge, lasso, and tensor regression. Applying our method to Human Connectome Project data, we find that functional connectivity is moderately predictable from structure at the genetic level (max R^2 = 0.34), though it is not directly predictable in the observed data (max R^2 = 0.03). This stark contrast suggests that unique environmental factors mask strong genetically-encoded structure-function relationships."

To mitigate such damages, objective decision-making backed by scientific methods is necessary. An IoT-based, cost-effective quality monitoring system can provide a solution by going beyond subjective quality monitoring and decision-making practices. Here, we propose a low-power, cost-effective fruit quality monitoring system with an array of MQ gas sensors, which can be used as an electronic nose. We track the volatile gas emissions, specifically ethanol, methane, and ammonia, encompassing both ripening and decomposition for a set of bananas. Based on the gas concentration thresholds, we develop a mathematical model to accurately assess fruit quality. We also integrate this information into a dashboard for prompt decision-making and monitoring to make it useful to the farmers. This approach has the potential to reduce economic losses, enhance food safety, and provide scalable solutions for the supply chain."

In this work, we move beyond the two-parameter Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) form adopted in recent DESI analyses and re-examine neutrino mass constraints using a flexible four-parameter dark energy equation of state (4pDE). We implement the 4pDE model in a modified version of CLASS and perform a full MCMC analysis using Planck, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon+ data. Relative to our previous 4pDE study based on pre-DESI BAO datasets, the inclusion of DESI DR2 substantially tightens the constraints on the transition parameters while still yielding a relaxed neutrino-mass bound compared to $Λ$CDM, $\\sum m_ν< 0.101$ eV ($95\\%$ C.L.). This upper limit is more stringent than the DESI DR2 constraint obtained within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. From the best-fit parameters, we reconstruct the evolution of the 4pDE equation of state along with both $68\\%$ and $95\\%$C.L. We do not find a statistically significant phantom-crossing at $z \\sim 0.5$, consistent with the conclusion from the DESI collaboration; at higher redshifts, the reconstructed $w(z)$ follows the CPL evolution and deviates only at low redshift.

We first characterise sub-game--perfect Nash equilibria and the corresponding value processes of all players through a system of coupled backward stochastic differential equations. We then analyse the mean-field counterpart and its sub-game--perfect mean-field equilibria, described by a system of McKean-Vlasov backward stochastic differential equations.

We identify four core capabilities of FMs in multi-agent contexts: understanding, planning, efficient communication, and adaptation. Contrary to assumptions about the spontaneous emergence of such abilities, we provide extensive empirical evidence across 41 large language models showing that strong single-agent performance alone does not automatically yield robust multi-agent intelligence.

We develop a principled framework for functions with multiple regions of monotonicity by constraining the number of stationary points. We represent each function in the diffeomorphic formulation as the composition of a simple template and a smooth bijective transformation, and show that this parameterization enables coherent joint inference on the extrema. This construction guarantees a prespecified number of stationary points and provides a direct, interpretable parameterization of their locations. We derive non-asymptotic confidence bounds and establish approximate normality for the maximum likelihood estimators, with parallel results in the Bayesian setting.

To mitigate these biases, existing approaches frequently depend on curated prompt datasets - either manually constructed or generated with large language models (LLMs) - as part of their training and/or evaluation procedures. Beside the curation cost, this also risks overlooking unanticipated, less obvious prompts that trigger biased generation, even in models that have undergone debiasing. In this work, we introduce Bias-Guided Prompt Search (BGPS), a framework that automatically generates prompts that aim to maximize the presence of biases in the resulting images. BGPS comprises two components: (1) an LLM instructed to produce attribute-neutral prompts and (2) attribute classifiers acting on the TTI's internal representations that steer the decoding process of the LLM toward regions of the prompt space that amplify the image attributes of interest. We conduct extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and a state-of-the-art debiased model and discover an array of subtle and previously undocumented biases that severely deteriorate fairness metrics. Crucially, the discovered prompts are interpretable, i.e they may be entered by a typical user, quantitatively improving the perplexity metric compared to a prominent hard prompt optimization counterpart. Our findings uncover TTI vulnerabilities, while BGPS expands the bias search space and can act as a new evaluation tool for bias mitigation."

For the vast majority of nights, we detect statistically significant polarization of ${\\approx}1$\\%, a fraction of which is of interstellar origin. We find a significant change of polarization coinciding in time with discrete radio ejections. The direction of this polarization variation differs from the directions inferred from the X-ray, sub-mm and radio polarization angles, as well as from the resolved jet orientation. After correcting for the interstellar component, we find that the intrinsic polarization degree remained approximately constant at PD $\\approx 0.3$\\% throughout the hard-intermediate state. We explore several possible origins for the polarization and conclude that it is most plausibly produced by scattering within the optically thin accretion disk wind. The intrinsic polarization angle, PA $\\approx-15°$, is notably offset from the jet axis, which we interpret as evidence for a misalignment between the black hole spin and the orbital axis."

Formulating the problem as sampling from an unnormalized distribution supported on neighborhoods of locally optimal solutions, provides the opportunity to deploy Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and generative machine learning. In this work, we extend our previous self-supervised diffusion model fine-tuning framework to employ gradient-informed Markov chain Monte Carlo. We compare two algorithms - the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo - both initialized from a distribution learned by a diffusion model. Derivatives of an objective function that balances fuel consumption, time of flight and constraint violations are computed analytically using state transition matrices. We show that incorporating the gradient drift term accelerates mixing and improves convergence of the Markov chain for a multi-revolution transfer in the Saturn-Titan system. Among the evaluated methods, MALA provides the best trade-off between performance and computational cost. Starting from samples generated by a baseline diffusion model trained on a related transfer, MALA explicitly targets Pareto-optimal solutions. Compared to a random walk Metropolis algorithm, it increases the feasibility rate from 17.34% to 63.01% and produces a denser, more diverse coverage of the Pareto front. By fine-tuning a diffusion model on the generated samples and associated reward values with reward-weighted likelihood maximization, we learn the global solution structure of the problem and eliminate the need for a tedious separate data generation phase."

    "abstract": "The quality of recent SRC/CT Collaboration $J/ψ$ photoproduction data off a $^4$He target from Hall~D at Jefferson Laboratory, combined with the feasibility of measuring the reaction close to the free-nucleon energy threshold, opens the door to using incoherent $J/ψ$ photoproduction to access a variety of interesting physics aspects. An example is an estimate of the $J/ψ~p$ scattering length $|α_{J/ψ~p}|$ on the bound proton obtained using the Vector Meson Dominance model. This value can be compared with that of the free proton from the GlueX Collaboration. One may then project what would be expected from the SRC/CT Collaboration Experiment E12--25--002, which was recently approved by the JLab PAC. Using a plane-wave theoretical model to generate quasi-data, we find the experiment could achieve a result of $|α_{J/ψ~p}| = 3.08\\pm 0.45~\\mathrm{mfm}$, an uncertainty competitive with that of the free-proton measurement. A comparison between the two would allow an evaluation of the effects of medium modification in the case of light nuclei."

    "abstract": "We propose a novel renormalization group (RG) method for non mean-field models of spin glasses, which leads to the emergence of a novel order parameter. Unlike previous approaches where the RG procedure is based on a priori notions on the system, our analysis follows a minimality principle, where no a priori assumption is made. We apply our approach to a spin-glass model built on a hierarchical lattice. In the RG decimation procedure, a novel order parameter spontaneously emerges from the system symmetries, and self-similarity features of the RG transformation only. This order parameter is the projection of the spin configurations on the ground state of the system. Kadanoff's majority rule for ferromagnetic systems is replaced by a more complex scheme, which involves such novel order parameter. The ground state thus acts as a pattern which translates spin configurations from one length scale to another. The rescaling RG procedure is based on a minimal, information-theory approach and, combined with the decimation, it yields a complete RG transformation. Below the upper critical dimension, the predictions for the critical exponent $ν$, which describes the critical divergence of the correlation length, are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations from both this and previous studies. Overall, this study opens new avenues in the understanding of the critical ordering of realistic spin glasses, and it can be applied to spin-glass models on a cubic lattice and nearest-neighbor couplings which directly model spin-glass materials, such as AuFe, CuMn and other magnetic alloys."

While several aspects of its complex magnetic and structural characteristics have been examined through careful experiments and first principles studies, much of it remains debatable. In this study, we present one of the first comprehensive temperature-dependent Raman spectrum for bulk Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ and in the process reveal an interesting peak shift anomaly at 150 K. We discuss the possible relationship of this Raman anomaly with the anomalous lattice expansion reported earlier for this material at around 110 K. The impact of the anomalous lattice expansion on the magnetic anisotropy in this van der Waals material is also revealed by an isothermal magnetization analysis. These findings will prove crucial for the use of Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ in high-performance spintronic devices."

These identifications represent the majority ($\\geq$ 86%) of radio pulsars present in the LoTSS DR2 footprint and provide independent celestial positions and flux densities at 144 MHz. We compare LoTSS flux densities with literature values from various image and time-domain observations and find good agreement for all but two pulsars. We attribute these flux density deviations to intrinsic pulsar properties (nulling and off-pulse emission). We investigate criteria to select promising pulsar candidates using data from the upcoming LoTSS release of the entire Northern sky ($δ>0^\\circ$), as well as the LOFAR LBA Sky Survey (LoLSS) at 54 MHz (covering $δ>24^\\circ$). Of the 80 detections, 35 (44%) were blindly redetected based on their linear or circular polarization. Therefore we conclude that candidate selection based on polarization properties is a promising approach. Candidate selection can be supplemented with spectral indices via cross-matching to LoLSS sources at 54 MHz, as the high sensitivity of LoTSS is not matched by image-domain surveys at higher frequencies."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of trajectory planning for information gathering with a dynamic and resolution-varying sensor footprint. Ergodic planning offers a principled framework that balances exploration (visiting all areas) and exploitation (focusing on high-information regions) by planning trajectories such that the time spent in a region is proportional to the amount of information in that region. Existing ergodic planning often oversimplifies the sensing model by assuming a point sensor or a footprint with constant shape and resolution. In practice, the sensor footprint can drastically change over time as the robot moves, such as aerial robots equipped with downward-facing cameras, whose field of view depends on the orientation and altitude. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new metric that accounts for dynamic sensor footprints, analyze the theoretic local optimality conditions, and propose numerical trajectory optimization algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can simultaneously optimize both the trajectories and sensor footprints, with up to an order of magnitude better ergodicity than conventional methods. We also deploy our approach in a multi-drone system to ergodically cover an object in 3D space."

    "abstract": "In oncological clinical trials, overall survival (OS) is the gold-standard endpoint, but long follow-up and treatment switching can delay or dilute detectable effects. Progression-free survival (PFS) often provides earlier evidence and is therefore frequently used together with OS as multiple primary endpoints. Since in certain scenarios trial success may be defined if one of the two hypotheses involved can be rejected, a correction for multiple testing may be deemed necessary. Because PFS and OS are generally highly dependent, their test statistics are typically correlated. Ignoring this dependency (e.g. via a simple Bonferroni correction) is not power optimal. We develop a group-sequential testing procedure for the multiple primary endpoints PFS and OS that fully exhausts the family-wise error rate (FWER) by exploiting their dependence. Specifically, we characterize the joint asymptotic distribution of log-rank statistics across endpoints and multiple event-driven analysis cutoffs. Furthermore, we show that we can consistently estimate the covariance structure. Embedding these results in a closed testing procedure, we can recalculate critical values of the test statistics in order to spend the available type I error optimally. An important extension to the current literature is that we allow for both interim and final analysis to be event-driven. Simulations based on illness-death multi-state models empirically confirm FWER control for moderate to large sample sizes. Compared with a simple Bonferroni correction, the proposed methods recover roughly two thirds of the power loss for OS, increase disjunctive and conjunctive power, and enable meaningful early stopping. In planning, these gains translate into about 5% fewer OS events required to reach the targeted power. We also discuss practical issues in the implementation of such designs and possible extensions of the introduced method."

    "abstract": "The dominance of denoising generative models (e.g., diffusion, flow-matching) in visual synthesis is tempered by their substantial training costs and inefficiencies in representation learning. While injecting discriminative representations via auxiliary alignment has proven effective, this approach still faces key limitations: the reliance on external, pre-trained encoders introduces overhead and domain shift. A dispersed-based strategy that encourages strong separation among in-batch latent representations alleviates this specific dependency. To assess the effect of the number of negative samples in generative modeling, we propose {\\mname}, a plug-and-play training framework that requires no external encoders. Our method integrates a memory bank mechanism that maintains a large, dynamically updated queue of negative samples across training iterations. This decouples the number of negatives from the mini-batch size, providing abundant and high-quality negatives for a contrastive objective without a multiplicative increase in computational cost. A low-dimensional projection head is used to further minimize memory and bandwidth overhead. {\\mname} offers three principal advantages: (1) it is self-contained, eliminating dependency on pretrained vision foundation models and their associated forward-pass overhead; (2) it introduces no additional parameters or computational cost during inference; and (3) it enables substantially faster convergence, achieving superior generative quality more efficiently. On ImageNet-256, {\\mname} achieves a state-of-the-art FID of \\textbf{2.40} within 400k steps, significantly outperforming comparable methods."

    "abstract": "A key feature of turbulent suspensions that involve floating particles on the surface or inertial particles in the bulk is the compressibility of the effective particle-phase velocity field. Little, however, is known about the effects of small-scale flow compressibility on the stretching and breaking of particles. Here, we gain insight into the nature of these effects by studying the deformation of tiny particles in model fluctuating flows. We consider a generic particle with extensional dynamics that are governed by a vector model, which accounts for elasticity, internal viscosity, and non-affine deformation. Applying the dynamical systems approach of Balkovsky, Fouxon & Lebedev (2000), we first obtain general results for the stationary statistics of particle extension in compressible chaotic flows. We then specialize to a time-decorrelated Gaussian random flow and derive an exact solution for the Batchelor regime of the compressible Kraichnan model. We also perform numerical simulations for a time-correlated renewing flow. While straining is suppressed on the average in compressible flows, our results show that large deviations of the strain rate strongly stretch particles and give rise to a power-law distribution of extensions. Extreme straining events are particularly important for stiff particles and, in the examples considered here, give rise to a counter-intuitive effect: stiff particles stretch more and break faster in flows of increasing compressibility. Highly-elastic particles, whose deformation is dictated by the mean straining, stretch less and break slower. Though based on specific random flows, our work shows how compressibility can affect the extensional dynamics of particles by altering the fluctuations of the strain rate, including its large deviations."

    "abstract": "We investigate magnomechanically induced transparency in a parity-time-symmetric cavity magnomechanical system with traveling-field-induced non-Hermiticity. The setup consists of a microwave cavity mode coupled to magnons in a single-crystal yttrium iron garnet sphere, which in turn are hybridized with a vibrational mechanical mode through magnetostrictive interaction. In the Hermitian regime, strong photon-magnon coupling generates a single transparency window in the cavity transmission, which splits into a doublet when the magnon is coherently hybridized with the mechanical mode via magnomechanical coupling. This establishes a versatile platform in which the transparency spectrum can be engineered from single- to multi-window response using experimentally accessible, scaled magnomechanical interactions. When a non-Hermitian coupling is introduced, the system enters a parity-time-broken regime in which the transparency ceases to be purely passive and becomes gain assisted, leading to asymmetric transmission with amplification on one side of the resonance and enhanced absorption on the other. By tuning the cavity detuning, we convert magnomechanical transparency into Fano-type line shapes with strongly non-Lorentzian phase dispersion and map their deformation into asymmetric, gain-assisted Fano ridges in the joint space of probe and magnon detunings. Finally, we analyze the associated group delay and show that both slow- and fast-light behavior can be widely tuned by varying the photon-magnon and magnomechanical couplings together with the non-Hermitian strength, highlighting parity-time-symmetric cavity magnomechanics as a promising platform for reconfigurable quantum signal processing and enhanced sensing."

Our study shows that template-sample similarity (TSS), defined as the resemblance between a text template and an image sample, introduces bias. This bias leads the model to rely on template proximity rather than true sample-to-category alignment, reducing both accuracy and robustness in classification. We present a framework that uses empty prompts, textual inputs that convey the idea of \"emptiness\" without category information. These prompts capture unbiased template features and offset TSS bias. The framework employs two stages. During pre-training, empty prompts reveal and reduce template-induced bias within the CLIP encoder. During few-shot fine-tuning, a bias calibration loss enforces correct alignment between images and their categories, ensuring the model focuses on relevant visual cues. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our template correction method significantly reduces performance fluctuations caused by TSS, yielding higher classification accuracy and stronger robustness.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce Dflow-SUR, a differentiation strategy that separates the optimization of the physical loss from the flow matching inference. Compared to the most advanced energy-based baseline, Dflow-SUR achieves a reduction in physical loss by four orders of magnitude, while also cutting wall-clock time by 74% on the airfoil case. Additionally, it increases the mean lift-to-drag ratio by 11.8% over traditional Latin-hypercube sampling in wing design. Beyond improvements in accuracy and efficiency, Dflow-SUR offers three additional practical advantages: (i) enhanced control over guidance, (ii) lower surrogate uncertainty, and (iii) greater robustness to hyper-parameter tuning. Together, these results demonstrate that Dflow-SUR is a highly promising framework, providing both scalability and high fidelity for generative aerodynamic design."

Oblique forests address this with per-node hyperplane splits, but at added computational cost and implementation complexity. We propose a simple alternative: JARF, Jacobian-Aligned Random Forests. Concretely, we first fit an axis-aligned forest to estimate class probabilities or regression outputs, compute finite-difference gradients of these predictions with respect to each feature, aggregate them into an expected Jacobian outer product that generalizes the expected gradient outer product (EGOP), and use it as a single global linear preconditioner for all inputs. This supervised preconditioner applies a single global rotation of the feature space, then hands the transformed data back to a standard axis-aligned forest, preserving off-the-shelf training pipelines while capturing oblique boundaries and feature interactions that would otherwise require many axis-aligned splits to approximate. The same construction applies to any model that provides gradients, though we focus on random forests and gradient-boosted trees in this work. On tabular classification and regression benchmarks, this preconditioning consistently improves axis-aligned forests and often matches or surpasses oblique baselines while improving training time. Our experimental results and theoretical analysis together indicate that supervised preconditioning can recover much of the accuracy of oblique forests while retaining the simplicity and robustness of axis-aligned trees."

For a finitely generated projective module associated to any piecewise cleft principal comodule algebra, we provide an explicit formula computing the clutching $K_1$-class in terms of the representation matrix defining the module. Thus, the module is determined by an explicit Milnor idempotent. We apply this new tool to the K-theory of quantum complex projective planes to determine their $K_0$-generators in terms of modules associated to noncommutative Hopf fibrations. On the other hand, using explicit homotopy between unitaries, we express the $K_0$-class of the Milnor idempotents in terms of elementary projections in the Toeplitz C*-algebra. This allows us to infer that all our generators are in the positive cone of the $K_0$-group, which is a purely quantum phenomenon absent in the classical case."

    "abstract": "This paper develops a theoretical framework for the design of Active Split-Ring Resonators (ASRRs). An ASRR is a Split-Ring Resonator (SRR) equipped with a tunable negative resistor, enabling both switchability and quality factor boosting and tuning. These properties make ASRRs well-suited for integration into dense arrays on silicon chips, where pixelated near-fields are generated and leveraged for high-resolution 2D imaging of samples. Such imagers pave the way for real-time, non-invasive, and low-cost imaging of human body tissue. The paper investigates ASRR coupling to host transmission lines, nonlinear effects, signal flow, and the influence of various noise sources on detection performance. Verified through simulations, these studies provide design guidelines for optimizing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and power consumption of a single pixel, while adhering to the constraints of a scalable array."

The MWISP survey was conducted using the PMO 13.7 m telescope at a spatial resolution of approximately 50\" and a velocity resolution of 0.16 km/s at 115 GHz. DR1 fully covered 2310 square degrees within the Galactic longitude (l) and latitude (b) range of 9.75 deg =< l=< 229.75 deg and |b| =< 5.25 deg. The surveyed area was divided into cell units of 30'x30' for practical purposes and On-The-Fly (OTF) mapping was performed toward each target cell unit. The data were regridded into a regular 3D datacube in l-b-V_LSR with a pixel size of 30\" in l-b axes and 0.16 km/s in theV_LSR axis. The median rms noise is 0.47 K, 0.25 K, and 0.25 K for 12CO, 13CO, and C18O, respectively. The equivalent 3 sigma sensitivity in 12CO luminosity is approximately 0.23 K km/s, making MWISP the most sensitive survey of its kind. In this paper, we describe the survey data, including the calibration, data cleaning, data mosaic processes, and the data products. The final mosaicked data cubes contain about 3.33x10^7 spectra (pixels) for each CO isotopologue line. Color composite images, made from the intensities of the isotopologue lines, and some concise descriptions are provided. We constructed a molecular cloud catalog based on the mosaicked 12CO data cube using the clustering algorithm DBSCAN, detecting 103,517 molecular clouds, 10,790 of which exhibit 13CO emission and 304 of which show C18O emission. Based on the histogram of voxel brightness temperature, we estimated a total 12CO flux of 7.69+/-0.38x10^7 K km/s arcmin^2, 82% of which is captured by the DBSCAN algorithm. The data, together with the cloud sample, provide unique information on molecular gas in the northern Milky Way."

    "abstract": "Camera-based temporal 3D object detection has shown impressive results in autonomous driving, with offline models improving accuracy by using future frames. Knowledge distillation (KD) can be an appealing framework for transferring rich information from offline models to online models. However, existing KD methods overlook future frames, as they mainly focus on spatial feature distillation under strict frame alignment or on temporal relational distillation, thereby making it challenging for online models to effectively learn future knowledge. To this end, we propose a sparse query-based approach, Future Temporal Knowledge Distillation (FTKD), which effectively transfers future frame knowledge from an offline teacher model to an online student model. Specifically, we present a future-aware feature reconstruction strategy to encourage the student model to capture future features without strict frame alignment. In addition, we further introduce future-guided logit distillation to leverage the teacher's stable foreground and background context. FTKD is applied to two high-performing 3D object detection baselines, achieving up to 1.3 mAP and 1.3 NDS gains on the nuScenes dataset, as well as the most accurate velocity estimation, without increasing inference cost."

While prior work has focused primarily on kernel-level performance or single-GPU microbenchmarks, the complex interaction between communication, computation, memory behavior, and power management in multi-GPU LLM training remains poorly characterized. In this work, we introduce Chopper, a profiling and analysis framework that collects, aligns, and visualizes GPU kernel traces and hardware performance counters across multiple granularities (i.e., from individual kernels to operations, layers, phases, iterations, and GPUs). Using Chopper, we perform a comprehensive end-to-end characterization of Llama 3 8B training under fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP) on an eight-GPU AMD InstinctTM MI300X node. Our analysis reveals several previously underexplored bottlenecks and behaviors, such as memory determinism enabling higher, more stable GPU and memory frequencies. We identify several sources of inefficiencies, with frequency overhead (DVFS effects) being the single largest contributor to the gap between theoretical and observed performance, exceeding the impact of MFMA utilization loss, communication/computation overlap, and kernel launch overheads. Overall, Chopper provides the first holistic, multi-granularity characterization of LLM training on AMD InstinctTM MI300X GPUs, yielding actionable insights for optimizing training frameworks, improving power-management strategies, and guiding future GPU architecture and system design."

The proposed architecture integrates algebraic topology with differential geometry to construct cohomological operators that generalize gradient-based learning within a homological landscape. Synthetic data with controlled topological signatures and real neural datasets are jointly analyzed using persistent homology, sheaf cohomology, and spectral Laplacians to quantify stability, continuity, and structural preservation. Empirical results demonstrate that the model achieves superior manifold consistency and noise resilience compared to graph neural and manifold-based deep architectures, establishing a coherent mathematical foundation for topology-driven representation learning."

The Georgi-Glashow model has a new monopole, the Wu-Yang monopole which has the W boson dressing, in addition to the well known 'tHooft-Polyakov monopole.

    "abstract": "Humans interpret safety not as a binary signal but as a continuous, context- and spatially-dependent notion of risk. While risk is subjective, humans form rational mental models that guide action selection in dynamic environments. This work proposes a framework for extracting implicit human risk models by introducing a novel, semantically-conditioned and spatially-varying parametrization of risk, supervised directly from safe human demonstration videos and VLM common sense. Notably, we define risk through a Bayesian formulation. The prior is furnished by a pretrained vision-language model. In order to encourage the risk estimate to be more human aligned, a likelihood function modulates the prior to produce a relative metric of risk. Specifically, the likelihood is a learned ViT that maps pretrained features, to pixel-aligned risk values. Our pipeline ingests RGB images and a query object string, producing pixel-dense risk images. These images that can then be used as value-predictors in robot planning tasks or be projected into 3D for use in conventional trajectory optimization to produce human-like motion. This learned mapping enables generalization to novel objects and contexts, and has the potential to scale to much larger training datasets. In particular, the Bayesian framework that is introduced enables fast adaptation of our model to additional observations or common sense rules. We demonstrate that our proposed framework produces contextual risk that aligns with human preferences. Additionally, we illustrate several downstream applications of the model; as a value learner for visuomotor planners or in conjunction with a classical trajectory optimization algorithm. Our results suggest that our framework is a significant step toward enabling autonomous systems to internalize human-like risk.

    "abstract": "We have computed the physical processes involved in a head-on collision between a neutron star (NS) and a white dwarf (WD). The outcomes of such collisions vary depending on the mass and type of the WD. We have separately examined the dynamical processes for collisions between NSs and helium WDs (He-WDs), carbon-oxygen WDs (CO-WDs), and oxygen-neon WDs (ONe-WDs). We aim to investigate whether the collision can trigger a thermonuclear explosion of the WD, and if not, whether the NS can remain bound within the WD to form a Thorne-Zytkow-like object (TZlO). For a thermonuclear explosion to occur, at least two conditions must be satisfied: (i) the collision-induced temperature must reach the ignition threshold of the relevant nuclear reactions, and (ii) the burning material must remain in a degenerate state. For different types of WDs, there exist parameter ranges where both conditions are fulfilled, implying that NS-WD collisions can indeed induce thermonuclear explosions, leading to sub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia supernovae or other exotic optical transients powered by thermonuclear explosion. On the other hand, the formation of a TZlO requires that the WD material exerts sufficient drag on the NS to prevent its escape, while the interaction must not trigger a thermonuclear explosion of the WD. Our results indicate that such conditions can be realized in the case of low-mass CO-WDs and low-mass ONe-WDs, provided that the viscous coefficient is sufficiently large."

    "abstract": "Personalized neoantigen vaccines represent a promising immunotherapy approach that harnesses tumor-specific antigens to stimulate anti-tumor immune responses. However, the design of these vaccines requires sophisticated computational workflows to predict and prioritize neoantigen candidates from patient sequencing data, coupled with rigorous review to ensure candidate quality. While numerous computational tools exist for neoantigen prediction, to our knowledge, there are no established protocols detailing the complete process from raw sequencing data through systematic candidate selection. Here, we present ImmunoNX (Immunogenomics Neoantigen eXplorer), an end-to-end protocol for neoantigen prediction and vaccine design that has supported over 185 patients across 11 clinical trials. The workflow integrates tumor DNA/RNA and matched normal DNA sequencing data through a computational pipeline built with Workflow Definition Language (WDL) and executed via Cromwell on Google Cloud Platform. ImmunoNX employs consensus-based variant calling, in-silico HLA typing, and pVACtools for neoantigen prediction. Additionally, we describe a two-stage immunogenomics review process with prioritization of neoantigen candidates, enabled by pVACview, followed by manual assessment of variants using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV). This workflow enables vaccine design in under three months. We demonstrate the protocol using the HCC1395 breast cancer cell line dataset, identifying 78 high-confidence neoantigen candidates from 322 initial predictions. Although demonstrated here for vaccine development, this workflow can be adapted for diverse neoantigen therapies and experiments. Therefore, this protocol provides the research community with a reproducible, version-controlled framework for designing personalized neoantigen vaccines, supported by detailed documentation, example datasets, and open-source code."

    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of cancerous lesions from 3D computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for automated treatment planning and response assessment. However, even state-of-the-art models combining self-supervised learning (SSL) pretrained transformers with convolutional decoders are susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, generating confidently incorrect tumor segmentations, posing risks for safe clinical deployment. Existing logit-based methods suffer from task-specific model biases, while architectural enhancements to explicitly detect OOD increase parameters and computational costs. Hence, we introduce a plug-and-play and lightweight post-hoc random forests-based OOD detection framework called RF-Deep that leverages deep features with limited outlier exposure. RF-Deep enhances generalization to imaging variations by repurposing the hierarchical features from the pretrained-then-finetuned backbone encoder, providing task-relevant OOD detection by extracting the features from multiple regions of interest anchored to the predicted tumor segmentations. Hence, it scales to images of varying fields-of-view. We compared RF-Deep against existing OOD detection methods using 1,916 CT scans across near-OOD (pulmonary embolism, negative COVID-19) and far-OOD (kidney cancer, healthy pancreas) datasets. RF-Deep achieved AUROC > 93.50 for the challenging near-OOD datasets and near-perfect detection (AUROC > 99.00) for the far-OOD datasets, substantially outperforming logit-based and radiomics approaches. RF-Deep maintained similar performance consistency across networks of different depths and pretraining strategies, demonstrating its effectiveness as a lightweight, architecture-agnostic approach to enhance the reliability of tumor segmentation from CT volumes."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models for code (LLMs4Code) are increasingly used to generate software artifacts, including library and package recommendations in languages such as Go. However, recent evidence shows that LLMs frequently hallucinate package names or generate dependencies containing known security vulnerabilities, posing significant risks to developers and downstream software supply chains. At the same time, quantization has become a widely adopted technique to reduce inference cost and enable deployment of LLMs on resource-constrained environments. Despite its popularity, little is known about how quantization affects the correctness and security of LLM-generated software dependencies while generating shell commands for package installation. In this work, we conduct the first systematic empirical study of the impact of quantization on package hallucination and vulnerability risks in LLM-generated Go packages. We evaluate five Qwen model sizes under full-precision, 8-bit, and 4-bit quantization across three datasets (SO, MBPP, and paraphrase). Our results show that quantization substantially increases the package hallucination rate (PHR), with 4-bit models exhibiting the most severe degradation. We further find that even among the correctly generated packages, the vulnerability presence rate (VPR) rises as precision decreases, indicating elevated security risk in lower-precision models. Finally, our analysis of hallucinated outputs reveals that most fabricated packages resemble realistic URL-based Go module paths, such as most commonly malformed or non-existent GitHub and golang.org repositories, highlighting a systematic pattern in how LLMs hallucinate dependencies. Overall, our findings provide actionable insights into the reliability and security implications of deploying quantized LLMs for code generation and dependency recommendation."

However, existing approaches are predominantly simulation-based or rely on IoT devices and PCs, leaving commodity mobile phones largely unexplored. A key gap is the absence of an open-source framework that enables practical LLM fine-tuning on mobile phones. We present MobileFineTuner, a unified open-source framework that enables end-to-end LLM fine-tuning directly on commodity mobile phones. MobileFineTuner is designed for efficiency, scalability, and usability, supporting full-parameters fine-tuning (Full-FT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). To address the memory and energy limitations inherent to mobile phones, we introduce system-level optimizations including parameter sharding, gradient accumulation, and energy-aware computation scheduling. We demonstrate the practicality of MobileFineTuner by fine-tuning GPT-2, Gemma 3, and Qwen 2.5 on real mobile phones. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimizations and establish MobileFineTuner as a viable foundation for future research on on-device LLM training."

    "abstract": "Connected vehicles represent a key enabler of intelligent transportation systems, where vehicles are equipped with advanced communication, sensing, and computing technologies to interact not only with one another but also with surrounding infrastructures and the environment. Through continuous data exchange, such vehicles are capable of enhancing road safety, improving traffic efficiency, and ensuring more reliable mobility services. Further, when these capabilities are integrated with advanced automation technologies, the concept essentially evolves into connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). While connected vehicles primarily focus on seamless information sharing, autonomous vehicles are mainly dependent on advanced perception, decision-making, and control mechanisms to operate with minimal or without human intervention. However, as a result of connectivity, an adversary with malicious intentions might be able to compromise successfully by breaching the system components of CAVs. In this paper, we present an attack-tree based methodology for evaluating cyber security vulnerabilities in CAVs. In particular, we utilize the attack-defense tree formulation to systematically assess attack-leaf vulnerabilities, and before analyzing the vulnerability indices, we also define a measure of vulnerabilities, which is based on existing cyber security threats and corresponding defensive countermeasures."

We developed SpeF-Phixer, a spatially extended phi-mixing framework integrating whole-slide image (WSI)-derived spatial cell distributions with mapped scRNA-seq expression fields to infer directed gene regulatory triplets with spatial coherence. Methods: Using CD103/CD8-immunostained colorectal cancer WSIs and publicly available scRNA-seq datasets, spatial gene fields were constructed around mapped cells and discretized for signed phi-mixing computation. Pairwise dependencies, directional signs, and triplet structures were evaluated through kNN-based neighborhood screening and bootstrap consensus inference. Mediation and convergence were distinguished using generalized additive models (GAMs), with spatial validity assessed by real-null comparisons and database-backed direction checks. Results: Across tissue patches, the pipeline reduced approximately 3.6x10^4 triplet candidates to a reproducible consensus set (approximately 3x10^2 per patch). The downstream edge (Y to Z) showed significant directional bias consistent with curated regulatory databases. Spatial path tracing demonstrated markedly higher coherence for real triplets than for null controls, indicating that inferred chains represent biologically instantiated regulatory flows. Conclusion: SpeF-Phixer extracts spatially coherent, directionally consistent gene regulatory triplets from histological images. This framework bridges single-cell molecular profiles with microenvironmental organization and provides a scalable foundation for constructing spatially informed causal gene networks."

    "abstract": "While recent large vision-language models (VLMs) have improved generalization in vision-language navigation (VLN), existing methods typically rely on end-to-end pipelines that map vision-language inputs directly to short-horizon discrete actions. Such designs often produce fragmented motions, incur high latency, and struggle with real-world challenges like dynamic obstacle avoidance. We propose DualVLN, the first dual-system VLN foundation model that synergistically integrates high-level reasoning with low-level action execution. System 2, a VLM-based global planner, \"grounds slowly\" by predicting mid-term waypoint goals via image-grounded reasoning. System 1, a lightweight, multi-modal conditioning Diffusion Transformer policy, \"moves fast\" by leveraging both explicit pixel goals and latent features from System 2 to generate smooth and accurate trajectories. The dual-system design enables robust real-time control and adaptive local decision-making in complex, dynamic environments. By decoupling training, the VLM retains its generalization, while System 1 achieves interpretable and effective local navigation. DualVLN outperforms prior methods across all VLN benchmarks and real-world experiments demonstrate robust long-horizon planning and real-time adaptability in dynamic environments."

We propose a survey-calibrated distributional random forest (SDRF) that incorporates complex-design features via a pseudo-population bootstrap, PSU-level honesty, and a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) split criterion computed from kernel mean embeddings of Hájek-type (design-weighted) node distributions. We provide a framework for analyzing forest-style estimators under survey designs; establish design consistency for the finite-population target and model consistency for the super-population target under explicit conditions on the design, kernel, resampling multipliers, and tree partitions. As far as we are aware, these are the first results on model-free estimation of conditional distributions under survey designs. Simulations under a stratified two-stage cluster design provide finite sample performance and demonstrate the statistical error price of ignoring the survey design. The broad applicability of SDRF is demonstrated using NHANES: We estimate the tolerance regions of the conditional joint distribution of two diabetes biomarkers, illustrating how distributional heterogeneity can support subgroup-specific risk profiling for diabetes mellitus in the U.S. population."

We employ the Gluestick pipeline to establish 2D-3D point and line feature correspondences for a robust and automatic initial guess. To enhance accuracy, we quantitatively analyze the impact of feature distribution on calibration results and adaptively weight the cost of each feature based on these metrics. As a result, extrinsic parameters are optimized by filtering out the adverse effects of inferior features. We validated our method through extensive experiments across various LiDAR-camera sensors in both indoor and outdoor settings.

Existing solutions fail: signature systems are brittle, anomaly methods lack actionability, and fully cloud-hosted LLMs raise latency, cost, and privacy concerns. We propose AIDR, a hybrid cloud-edge framework that addresses this trade-off through constrained information-density optimization. The core innovation is gradient-based compression of reasoning chains to retain only decision-critical steps--minimal evidence sufficient to justify predictions while respecting token and latency budgets. We demonstrate that this approach preserves decision-relevant information while minimizing complexity. We construct compact datasets by distilling alerts into 3-5 high-information bullets (68% token reduction), train domain-specialized experts via LoRA, and deploy a cloud-edge architecture: a cloud LLM routes alerts to on-premises experts generating SOAR-ready JSON. Experiments demonstrate AIDR achieves higher accuracy and 40.6% latency reduction versus Chain-of-Thought, with robustness to data corruption and out-of-distribution generalization, enabling auditable and efficient SOC triage with full data residency compliance."

Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved superhuman accuracy on physical-based benchmarks, a key challenge remains: aligning model representations with human perception, a promising strategy for enhancing model robustness and interpretability. Research in object recognition has revealed a complex trade-off between model accuracy and human-like behavior, raising a question whether a similar divergence exist in depth estimation, particularly for natural outdoor scenes where benchmarks rely on sensor-based ground truth rather than human perceptual estimates. In this study, we systematically investigated the relationship between model accuracy and human similarity across 69 monocular depth estimators using the KITTI dataset. To dissect the structure of error patterns on a factor-by-factor basis, we applied affine fitting to decompose prediction errors into interpretable components. Intriguingly, our results reveal while humans and DNNs share certain estimation biases (positive error correlations), we observed distinct trade-off relationships between model accuracy and human similarity. This finding indicates that improving accuracy does not necessarily lead to more human-like behavior, underscoring the necessity of developing multifaceted, human-centric evaluations beyond traditional accuracy."

In this work, we propose frequency-dependent slanted beams from true-time delay (TTD) analog arrays to achieve robust beamforming in wideband, multi-user downlink scenarios. Novel beams with linear angle-frequency relationships for different users and sub-bands provide a trade-off between instantaneous capacity and angular coverage. Compared to alternative analog array beamforming designs, slanted beams provide higher reliability to angle offsets and greater adaptability to varied user movement statistics."

Existing approaches primarily rely on unstructured representations, such as point clouds, voxels, or patch features, and inject scene context implicitly via coordinate embeddings. However, this often results in limited spatial reasoning capabilities due to the lack of explicit, high-level structural understanding. To address this limitation, we introduce two complementary components into a Large Multimodal Model-based architecture: target-affinity token, analogous to central vision, that guides the model's attention toward query-relevant objects; and allocentric grid, akin to peripheral vision, that captures global scene context and spatial arrangements. These components work in tandem to enable structured, context-aware understanding of complex 3D environments. Experiments show that CVP achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of 3D scene understanding benchmarks."

It enables the detection and tracking of solar active regions that have rotated to the farside (invisible surface) of the Sun without relying on direct observational platforms such as satellites. By applying the technique of helioseismic holography to continuous Doppler images of the front side (visible surface), the pipeline infers the size and location of these regions through the acoustic signatures. These farside maps, produced using data from the NSO's GONG Network, allow scientists and solar observers to monitor the behavior of solar active regions. They support efforts to protect vital telecommunications and national interest infrastructure. While the data from this pipeline are widely used to many scientific, industrial, and national security applications, global helioseismic monitoring remains a developing field, with ongoing refinements in methodology and reliability. In this report, we will outline the updates made to the NSO's Farside Pipeline which have resulted in more accurate and consistent helioseismic maps, strengthening its value for both operational forecasting and scientific research."

    "abstract": "Both model developers and policymakers seek to quantify and mitigate the risk of rapidly-evolving frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, especially large language models (LLMs), to facilitate bioterrorism or access to biological weapons. An important element of such efforts is the development of model benchmarks that can assess the biosecurity risk posed by a particular model. This paper describes the first component of a novel Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) Framework. The BBG approach is designed to help model developers and evaluators reliably measure and assess the biosecurity risk uplift and general harm potential of existing and future AI models, while accounting for key aspects of the threat itself that are often overlooked in other benchmarking efforts, including different actor capability levels, and operational (in addition to purely technical) risk factors. As a pilot, the BBG is first being developed to address bacterial biological threats only. The BBG is built upon a hierarchical structure of biothreat categories, elements and tasks, which then serves as the basis for the development of task-aligned queries. This paper outlines the development of this biothreat task-query architecture, which we have named the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, while future papers will describe follow-on efforts to turn queries into model prompts, as well as how the resulting benchmarks can be implemented for model evaluation. Overall, the BBG Framework, including the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, seeks to offer a robust, re-usable structure for evaluating bacterial biological risks arising from LLMs across multiple levels of aggregation, which captures the full scope of technical and operational requirements for biological adversaries, and which accounts for a wide spectrum of biological adversary capabilities."

Further, in these times of widespread availability of large computing powers, traffic simulation has emerged as a popular analysis and design tool. Such simulations rely on randomly generating the arriving vehicles in a way that statistically resembles real-world streams. The generation process for disorderly streams requires information on gap distributions. A study of past literature reveals that very little work has been done to determine the distribution of gaps on multi-lane orderly and disorderly streams. This study aims to develop an analytical framework to specify the distribution of gaps for such streams. This analytical framework is built using the Renewal Process Theory. A maximum likelihood based process for the estimation of the parameters of the analytically derived distribution is also described. Later, real-world gap data from three different sites covering orderly and disorderly streams are used to show how the derived distribution function (using the proposed method) ably describes the observed gap distributions."

Our approach builds upon the general multi-modal reasoning capabilities of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), progressively extending them to embodied reasoning and action prediction, and ultimately towards structured reasoning and reasoning-action alignment. This results in a three-stage pre-training pipeline: (1) Continued VLM pre-training on curated vision-language data to enhance embodied reasoning skills such as planning, spatial understanding, and trajectory prediction; (2) Co-training on cross-embodiment robot data alongside vision-language data; and (3) Action training with reasoning process on trajectories collected on Astribot S1, a bimanual mobile manipulator with human-like dexterity and agility. Finally, we integrate reinforcement learning to further refine reasoning-action consistency and close the loop between semantic inference and motor control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Lumo-1 achieves significant performance improvements in embodied vision-language reasoning, a critical component for generalist robotic control. Real-world evaluations further show that Lumo-1 surpasses strong baselines across a wide range of challenging robotic tasks, with strong generalization to novel objects and environments, excelling particularly in long-horizon tasks and responding to human-natural instructions that require reasoning over strategy, concepts and space."

Traditional models rely mainly on historical prices, but recent work shows that financial news can provide useful external signals. This paper investigates a multimodal approach that integrates companies' news articles with their historical stock data to improve prediction performance. We compare a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model with a baseline LSTM model. Historical data for each company is encoded using an LSTM, while news titles are embedded with a language model. These embeddings form nodes in a heterogeneous graph, and GraphSAGE is used to capture interactions between articles, companies, and industries. We evaluate two targets: a binary direction-of-change label and a significance-based label. Experiments on the US equities and Bloomberg datasets show that the GNN outperforms the LSTM baseline, achieving 53% accuracy on the first target and a 4% precision gain on the second. Results also indicate that companies with more associated news yield higher prediction accuracy. Moreover, headlines contain stronger predictive signals than full articles, suggesting that concise news summaries play an important role in short-term market reactions."

The utilization of a Fourier-based direct solver facilitates the attainment of flexibility and enhanced performance by accommodating any combination of unbounded and semi-unbounded boundary conditions. The employment of high-order compact stencils contributes to the reduction of communication demands while concurrently enhancing the accuracy of the system.

Double homodyne detection provides a powerful method for the direct measurement of the Husimi Q quasi-probability distribution, offering a complete state representation in a simple experimental setting and a limited time frame. Here, we demonstrate that double homodyne detection can serve as more than a passive measurement apparatus. By intentionally unbalancing the input beamsplitter that splits the quantum signal, we show that the detection scheme itself performs an effective squeezing or anti-squeezing transformation on the state being measured. The resulting measurement directly samples the Q function of the input state as if it were acted upon by a squeezing operator whose strength is a tunable experimental parameter : the beamsplitter's reflectivity. We experimentally realize this technique using a robust polarization-encoded double homodyne detection to characterize a squeezed vacuum state. Our results demonstrate the controlled deformation of the measured Q function's phase-space distribution, confirming that unbalanced double homodyne detection is a versatile tool for simultaneous quantum state manipulation and characterization."

    "abstract": "Autoregressive(AR)-diffusion hybrid paradigms combine AR's structured modeling with diffusion's photorealistic synthesis, yet suffer from high latency due to sequential AR generation and iterative denoising. In this work, we tackle this bottleneck and propose a unified AR-diffusion framework Fast-ARDiff that jointly optimizes both components, accelerating AR speculative decoding while simultaneously facilitating faster diffusion decoding. Specifically: (1) The entropy-informed speculative strategy encourages draft model to produce higher-entropy representations aligned with target model's entropy characteristics, mitigating entropy mismatch and high rejection rates caused by draft overconfidence. (2) For diffusion decoding, rather than treating it as an independent module, we integrate it into the same end-to-end framework using a dynamic scheduler that prioritizes AR optimization to guide the diffusion part in further steps. The diffusion part is optimized through a joint distillation framework combining trajectory and distribution matching, ensuring stable training and high-quality synthesis with extremely few steps. During inference, shallow feature entropy from AR module is used to pre-filter low-entropy drafts, avoiding redundant computation and improving latency.

    "abstract": "In strongly interacting massive particle (SIMP) scenarios, dark matter is comprised of stable dark pions whose $3\\to 2$ or $4\\to 2$ reactions set the dark matter relic abundance. Recent work has shown that shallow two-pion bound states significantly affect the freeze-out, but did not establish whether such states actually form. In this work we demonstrate that a scalar isosinglet bound state does exist in a well-defined region of parameter space by solving an on-shell Lippmann--Schwinger equation in a chiral-unitary framework and analyzing the $S$-wave $ππ$ amplitude in the complex energy plane. We determine the range of $m_π/f_π$ for which a pole appears below the two-pion threshold, extract the corresponding residue, and, in the non-relativistic limit, obtain the bound-state wave function at the origin, $|Ψ(0)|$, which controls bound-state-assisted annihilation and decay rates relevant for catalyzed freeze-out. Comparing this T-matrix based result with variational estimates using simple finite-range potentials, we find agreement within order-one factors for shallow binding. For binding energies of order the freeze-out temperature, $E_B \\sim m_π/20$, we obtain $|Ψ(0)|\\sim \\mathcal{O}(0.1)\\,m_π^{3/2}$, thereby supporting the parametric assumptions used in previous phenomenological analyses."

    "abstract": "Accurate and rapid state-of-health (SOH) monitoring plays an important role in indicating energy information for lithium-ion battery-powered portable mobile devices. To confront their variable working conditions, transfer learning (TL) emerges as a promising technique for leveraging knowledge from data-rich source working conditions, significantly reducing the training data required for SOH monitoring from target working conditions. However, traditional TL-based SOH monitoring is infeasible when applied in portable mobile devices since substantial computational resources are consumed during the TL stage and unexpectedly reduce the working endurance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight TL-based SOH monitoring approach with constructive incremental transfer learning (CITL). First, taking advantage of the unlabeled data in the target domain, a semi-supervised TL mechanism is proposed to minimize the monitoring residual in a constructive way, through iteratively adding network nodes in the CITL. Second, the cross-domain learning ability of node parameters for CITL is comprehensively guaranteed through structural risk minimization, transfer mismatching minimization, and manifold consistency maximization. Moreover, the convergence analysis of the CITL is given, theoretically guaranteeing the efficacy of TL performance and network compactness. Finally, the proposed approach is verified through extensive experiments with a realistic unmanned air vehicles (UAV) battery dataset collected from dozens of flight missions. Specifically, the CITL outperforms SS-TCA, MMD-LSTM-DA, DDAN, BO-CNN-TL, and AS$^3$LSTM, in SOH estimation by 83.73%, 61.15%, 28.24%, 87.70%, and 57.34%, respectively, as evaluated using the index root mean square error."

However, optimizing interleaved multimodal CoT (iMCoT) through reinforcement learning remains challenging, as it relies on scarce high-quality reasoning data. In this study, we propose Self-Calling Chain-of-Thought (sCoT), a novel visual reasoning paradigm that reformulates iMCoT as a language-only CoT with self-calling. Specifically, a main agent decomposes the complex visual reasoning task to atomic subtasks and invokes its virtual replicas, i.e. parameter-sharing subagents, to solve them in isolated context. sCoT enjoys substantial training effectiveness and efficiency, as it requires no explicit interleaving between modalities. sCoT employs group-relative policy optimization to reinforce effective reasoning behavior to enhance optimization. Experiments on HR-Bench 4K show that sCoT improves the overall reasoning performance by up to $1.9\\%$ with $\\sim 75\\%$ fewer GPU hours compared to strong baseline approaches.

    "abstract": "Enzymes are crucial catalysts that enable a wide range of biochemical reactions. Efficiently identifying specific enzymes from vast protein libraries is essential for advancing biocatalysis. Traditional computational methods for enzyme screening and retrieval are time-consuming and resource-intensive. Recently, deep learning approaches have shown promise. However, these methods focus solely on the interaction between enzymes and reactions, overlooking the inherent hierarchical relationships within each domain. To address these limitations, we introduce FGW-CLIP, a novel contrastive learning framework based on optimizing the fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance. FGW-CLIP incorporates multiple alignments, including inter-domain alignment between reactions and enzymes and intra-domain alignment within enzymes and reactions. By introducing a tailored regularization term, our method minimizes the Gromov-Wasserstein distance between enzyme and reaction spaces, which enhances information integration across these domains. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superiority of FGW-CLIP in challenging enzyme-reaction tasks. On the widely-used EnzymeMap benchmark, FGW-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance in enzyme virtual screening, as measured by BEDROC and EF metrics. Moreover, FGW-CLIP consistently outperforms across all three splits of ReactZyme, the largest enzyme-reaction benchmark, demonstrating robust generalization to novel enzymes and reactions. These results position FGW-CLIP as a promising framework for enzyme discovery in complex biochemical settings, with strong adaptability across diverse screening scenarios."

    "abstract": "Conditional diffusion models rely on language-to-image alignment methods to steer the generation towards semantically accurate outputs. Despite the success of this architecture, misalignment and hallucinations remain common issues and require automatic misalignment detection tools to improve quality, for example by applying them in a Best-of-N (BoN) post-generation setting. Unfortunately, measuring the alignment after the generation is an expensive step since we need to wait for the overall generation to finish to determine prompt adherence. In contrast, this work hypothesizes that text/image misalignments can be detected early in the denoising process, enabling real-time alignment assessment without waiting for the complete generation. In particular, we propose NoisyCLIP a method that measures semantic alignment in the noisy latent space. This work is the first to explore and benchmark prompt-to-latent misalignment detection during image generation using dual encoders in the reverse diffusion process. We evaluate NoisyCLIP qualitatively and quantitatively and find it reduces computational cost by 50% while achieving 98% of CLIP alignment performance in BoN settings. This approach enables real-time alignment assessment during generation, reducing costs without sacrificing semantic fidelity."

Current approaches typically employ a control-centric paradigm, forcing agents to navigate complex directory structures and irrelevant control logic.

We introduce a multi-agent framework that reconciles data integrity navigation with control flow logic. Our theoretical analysis and case studies demonstrate that this approach resolves the \"Semantic Trap\" inherent in standard RAG systems in modern coding agents. We provide a comprehensive implementation in the form of Autonomous Issue Resolver (AIR), a self-improvement system for zero-touch code maintenance that utilizes neuro-symbolic reasoning and uses the DTG structure for scalable logic repair. Our approach has demonstrated good results on several SWE benchmarks, reaching a resolution rate of 87.1% on SWE-Verified benchmark.

This paper presents a lightweight SAM-based tracking method combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with CSRT trackers and jersey color-based appearance models. We propose a team-aware tracking system that uses SAM for precise initialization and HSV histogram-based re-identification to improve occlusion recovery. Our evaluation measures three dimensions: processing speed (FPS and memory), tracking accuracy (success rate and box stability), and robustness (occlusion recovery and identity consistency). Experiments on football video sequences show that the approach achieves 7.6-7.7 FPS with stable memory usage (~1880 MB), maintaining 100 percent tracking success in light occlusions and 90 percent in crowded penalty-box scenarios with 5 or more players. Appearance-based re-identification recovers 50 percent of heavy occlusions, demonstrating the value of domain-specific cues. Analysis reveals key trade-offs: the SAM + CSRT combination provides consistent performance across crowd densities but struggles with long-term occlusions where players leave the frame, achieving only 8.66 percent re-acquisition success. These results offer practical guidelines for deploying football tracking systems under resource constraints, showing that classical tracker-based methods work well with continuous visibility but require stronger re-identification mechanisms for extended absences."

Based on this insight, explicit analytical conditions on the quantization gain and the security parameter are derived to prevent overflow in computing over encrypted data. Furthermore, the analysis reveals a quantitative relationship between quantization-induced errors and the deviation between the gains obtained by CFRIT and non-confidential Fictitious Reference Iterative Tuning (FRIT), clarifying how parameter choice affects tuning accuracy. A numerical example verifies the proposed procedure by demonstrating that the designed parameters achieve accurate encrypted tuning within a prescribed tolerance while preventing overflow. In addition, the admissible region of parameter combinations is visualized to examine the characteristics of feasible and infeasible regions, providing practical insights into parameter design for encrypted data-driven control."

This paper discusses the pilot implementation of the Bacterial Biothreat Benchmark (B3) dataset. It is the third in a series of three papers describing an overall Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) framework, with previous papers detailing the development of the B3 dataset. The pilot involved running the benchmarks through a sample frontier AI model, followed by human evaluation of model responses, and an applied risk analysis of the results along several dimensions. Overall, the pilot demonstrated that the B3 dataset offers a viable, nuanced method for rapidly assessing the biosecurity risk posed by a LLM, identifying the key sources of that risk and providing guidance for priority areas of mitigation priority."

While these methods perform well in in-distribution (ID) settings, their behavior under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions remains poorly understood. Through extensive experiments across multiple ID-OOD sets, we find that reliability of the existing subset based methods degrades markedly, yielding redundant, unstable, and uncertainty-sensitive explanations. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a framework that combines submodular subset selection with layer-wise, gradient-based uncertainty estimation to improve robustness and fidelity without requiring additional training or auxiliary models. Our approach estimates uncertainty via adaptive weight perturbations and uses these estimates to guide submodular optimization, ensuring diverse and informative subset selection. Empirical evaluations show that, beyond mitigating the weaknesses of existing methods under OOD scenarios, our framework also yields improvements in ID settings. These findings highlight limitations of current subset-based approaches and demonstrate how uncertainty-driven optimization can enhance attribution and object-level interpretability, paving the way for more transparent and trustworthy AI in real-world vision applications."

CMRs are allowed to depend on non-parametric components, which might be flexibly modeled using Machine Learning tools, and non-linearly on finite-dimensional parameters. The key step in this construction is the estimation of Orthogonal Instrumental Variables (OR-IVs) -- \"residualized\" functions of the conditioning variables, which are then combined to obtain a debiased moment. We argue that computing OR-IVs necessarily requires solving potentially complicated functional equations, which depend on unknown terms. However, by imposing an approximate sparsity condition, our method finds the solutions to those equations using a Lasso-type program and can then be implemented straightforwardly. Based on this, we introduce a GMM estimator of finite-dimensional parameters (structural parameters) in a two-step framework. We derive theoretical guarantees for our construction of OR-IVs and show $\\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality for the estimator of the structural parameters. Our Monte Carlo experiments and an empirical application on estimating firm-level production functions highlight the importance of relying on inference methods like the one proposed."

Rennervate leverages attention features to detect the covert injection at a fine-grained token level, enabling precise sanitization that neutralizes IPI attacks while maintaining LLM functionalities. Specifically, the token-level detector is materialized with a 2-step attentive pooling mechanism, which aggregates attention heads and response tokens for IPI detection and sanitization. Moreover, we establish a fine-grained IPI dataset, FIPI, to be open-sourced to support further research. Extensive experiments verify that Rennervate outperforms 15 commercial and academic IPI defense methods, achieving high precision on 5 LLMs and 6 datasets.

Under properness on bounded sets and a nonzero local index at the given base solution, each branch satisfies the following alternative: either it is unbounded, or it reaches the boundary of the domain, or it accumulates at a different solution on the base parameter level. When the component is bounded and stays in the interior, there is a degree balance on the base slice entailing a vanishing sum of local indices and, in particular, the existence of an even number of non-degenerate contact points. For real-analytic maps we construct locally injective parameterizations that exhibit blow-up, approach to the boundary, or return to the base level. An application to a quasilinear boundary value problem driven by the mean-curvature and Minkowski operators illustrates the global results."

This is possible because the tunneling current under the tip is an extremely localized electrical excitation source. However, in most STML applications, the spatial distribution of the emission relative to the excitation point is unresolved. Yet this distribution contains key information about how the interaction of excitons with injected charge carriers affects the luminescence of these materials, and about exciton transport. Resolving this spatial distribution at the nanoscale is relevant both for a fundamental understanding of exciton physics and for device applications; yet it remains a significant challenge. In this work, we resolve the spatial distribution of the emission beyond the diffraction limit of light by deconvolving real-space optical microscopy images of the STML using an iterative algorithm, i.e., Richardson-Lucy (RL) deconvolution. To showcase this technique, we apply it to the STML of monolayer tungsten diselenide ($\\mathrm{WSe_2}$) and tungsten disulfide ($\\mathrm{WS_2}$). Thus, we highlight hitherto ignored or misunderstood aspects of STML on 2D semiconductors related to exciton and charge carrier transport, namely the dependence of the spatial distribution of emission on the tunnel current setpoint and the origin of the emission from hot spots located micrometers from the excitation source."

We demonstrate that key Re-ID metrics (R1 and mAP@k) are substantially improved by using hard triplet mining in conjunction with a custom image transformation pipeline that includes dataset-specific normalization. By employing these strategies, we demonstrate that the Vision Transformer-based Swin-T architecture consistently outperforms the Convolutional Neural Network-based ResNet-50, achieving peak performance of 41.65% mAP@k and 90.43% Rank-1 accuracy. An in-depth analysis reveals that the primary challenge is distinguishing visually similar individuals of the same species (Intra-species errors), where viewpoint inconsistency proves significantly more detrimental than partial occlusion.

We tackle this challenge by performing three-dimensional protein pockets hydration-site prediction on a quantum computer. Formulating the water placement problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), we use a hybrid approach coupling a classical three-dimensional reference-interaction site model (3D-RISM) to an efficient quantum optimization solver, to run various hardware experiments up to 123 qubits. Matching the precision of classical approaches, our results reproduced experimental predictions on real-life protein-ligand complexes. Furthermore, through a detailed resource estimation analysis, we show that accuracy can be systematically improved with increasing number of qubits, indicating that full quantum utility is in reach. Finally, we provide evidence that advantageous situations could be found for systems where classical optimization struggles to provide optimal solutions. The method has potential for assisting simulations of protein-ligand complexes for drug lead optimization and setup of docking calculations."

    "abstract": "We report disorder-mediated first-order linear and higher-order nonlinear (magneto-)transport of Ta$_2$NiSe$_7$ (TNS) in the charge-density-wave (CDW) regime. CDW transition temperature ($T_{CDW}$) and carrier density are proportional and inversely proportional to residual resistance ratio of samples, respectively. Such relation helps to understand the unique CDW order therein. High-$T_{CDW}$ TNS exhibits negative first-harmonic magnetoresistance (MR$^{1ω}$) under a magnetic field ($B$) parallel to the direction of alternating current ($I^ω$), which may arise from the anomalous velocity induced by the Berry curvature of three-dimensional topological bands near the Fermi level. As $T_{CDW}$ drops, a positive-to-negative MR$^{1ω}$ transition is observed with decreasing perpendicular $B$, which is likely due to the contribution of Zeeman effect on current pathways in the disordered system. Moreover, interestingly, the second-harmonic nonlinear signals are suppressed, while the third-harmonic signals are significant and sensitive to both $B$ and $T_{CDW}$. Such observations, together with scaling analysis, suggest the quantum geometry quadrupole at play and the modulation of disorder on third-order nonlinearity. Our results pave an avenue for tailoring distinct-order magnetoresistive phases in disordered topological materials."

    "abstract": "This paper provides a fundamental characterization of the discrete ambiguity functions (AFs) of random communication waveforms under arbitrary orthonormal modulation with random constellation symbols, which serve as a key metric for evaluating the delay-Doppler sensing performance in future ISAC applications. A unified analytical framework is developed for two types of AFs, namely the discrete periodic AF (DP-AF) and the fast-slow time AF (FST-AF), where the latter may be seen as a small-Doppler approximation of the DP-AF. By analyzing the expectation of squared AFs, we derive exact closed-form expressions for both the expected sidelobe level (ESL) and the expected integrated sidelobe level (EISL) under the DP-AF and FST-AF formulations. For the DP-AF, we prove that the normalized EISL is identical for all orthogonal waveforms. To gain structural insights, we introduce a matrix representation based on the finite Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, where each delay-Doppler shift corresponds to a WH operator acting on the ISAC signal. This WH-group viewpoint yields sharp geometric constraints on the lowest sidelobes: The minimum ESL can only occur along a one-dimensional cut or over a set of widely dispersed delay-Doppler bins. Consequently, no waveform can attain the minimum ESL over any compact two-dimensional region, leading to a no-optimality (no-go) result under the DP-AF framework. For the FST-AF, the closed-form ESL and EISL expressions reveal a constellation-dependent regime governed by its kurtosis: The OFDM modulation achieves the minimum ESL for sub-Gaussian constellations, whereas the OTFS waveform becomes optimal for super-Gaussian constellations. Finally, four representative waveforms, namely, SC, OFDM, OTFS, and AFDM, are examined under both frameworks, and all theoretical results are verified through numerical examples."

While diffusion models provide strong generative priors for general image restoration, they often produce text hallucinations in text-centric tasks due to the absence of explicit linguistic knowledge. To address this, we propose UniT, a unified text restoration framework that integrates a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), a Vision-Language Model (VLM), and a Text Spotting Module (TSM) in an iterative fashion for high-fidelity text restoration. In UniT, the VLM extracts textual content from degraded images to provide explicit textual guidance. Simultaneously, the TSM, trained on diffusion features, generates intermediate OCR predictions at each denoising step, enabling the VLM to iteratively refine its guidance during the denoising process. Finally, the DiT backbone, leveraging its strong representational power, exploit these cues to recover fine-grained textual content while effectively suppressing text hallucinations. Experiments on the SA-Text and Real-Text benchmarks demonstrate that UniT faithfully reconstructs degraded text, substantially reduces hallucinations, and achieves state-of-the-art end-to-end F1-score performance in TAIR task."

    "abstract": "Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) manage complex, interrelated data and support a broad spectrum of analytical tasks. With the growing demand for predictive analytics, the deep integration of machine learning (ML) into RDBMS has become critical. However, a fundamental challenge hinders this evolution: conventional ML models are static and task-specific, whereas RDBMS environments are dynamic and must support diverse analytical queries. Each analytical task entails constructing a bespoke pipeline from scratch, which incurs significant development overhead and hence limits wide adoption of ML in analytics. We present NeurIDA, an autonomous end-to-end system for in-database analytics that dynamically \"tweaks\" the best available base model to better serve a given analytical task. In particular, we propose a novel paradigm of dynamic in-database modeling to pre-train a composable base model architecture over the relational data. Upon receiving a task, NeurIDA formulates the task and data profile to dynamically select and configure relevant components from the pool of base models and shared model components for prediction. For friendly user experience, NeurIDA supports natural language queries; it interprets user intent to construct structured task profiles, and generates analytical reports with dedicated LLM agents. By design, NeurIDA enables ease-of-use and yet effective and efficient in-database AI analytics. Extensive experiment study shows that NeurIDA consistently delivers up to 12% improvement in AUC-ROC and 25% relative reduction in MAE across ten tasks on five real-world datasets.

    "abstract": "Biosignals collected from wearable devices are widely utilized in healthcare applications. Machine learning models used in these applications often rely on features extracted from biosignals due to their effectiveness, lower data dimensionality, and wide compatibility across various model architectures. However, existing feature extraction methods often lack task-specific contextual knowledge, struggle to identify optimal feature extraction settings in high-dimensional feature space, and are prone to code generation and automation errors. In this paper, we propose DeepFeature, the first LLM-empowered, context-aware feature generation framework for wearable biosignals. DeepFeature introduces a multi-source feature generation mechanism that integrates expert knowledge with task settings. It also employs an iterative feature refinement process that uses feature assessment-based feedback for feature re-selection. Additionally, DeepFeature utilizes a robust multi-layer filtering and verification approach for robust feature-to-code translation to ensure that the extraction functions run without crashing. Experimental evaluation results show that DeepFeature achieves an average AUROC improvement of 4.21-9.67% across eight diverse tasks compared to baseline methods. It outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on five tasks while maintaining comparable performance on the remaining tasks."

While there has been a shift from viewing open systems solely as a source of error to treating them as a computational resource, their programmability remains largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a framework that characterizes and quantifies the programmability of Lindbladian semigroups by combining physically implementable retrieval maps with time varying program states. Within this framework, we identify quantum programmable classes enabled by symmetry and stochastic structure, including covariant semigroups and fully dissipative Pauli Lindbladians with finite program dimension. We further provide a necessary condition for physical programmability that rules out coherent generators and typical dissipators generating amplitude damping. For such nonphysically programmable cases, we construct explicit protocols with finite resources. Finally, we introduce an operational programming cost, defined via the number of samples required to program the Lindbladian, and establish its core structural properties, such as continuity and faithfulness. These results provide a notion of programming cost for Lindbladians, bridge programmable channel theory and open system dynamics, and yield symmetry driven compression schemes and actionable resource estimates for semigroup simulation and control in noisy quantum technologies."

    "abstract": "Accurate three-dimensional perception is essential for modern industrial robotic systems that perform manipulation, inspection, and navigation tasks. RGB-D and stereo vision sensors are widely used for this purpose, but the depth maps they produce are often noisy, incomplete, or biased due to sensor limitations and environmental conditions. Depth completion methods aim to generate dense, reliable depth maps from RGB images and sparse depth input. However, a key limitation in current depth completion pipelines is the unrealistic generation of sparse depth: sparse pixels are typically selected uniformly at random from dense ground-truth depth, ignoring the fact that real sensors exhibit geometry-dependent and spatially nonuniform reliability. In this work, we propose a normal-guided sparse depth sampling strategy that leverages PCA-based surface normal estimation on the RGB-D point cloud to compute a per-pixel depth reliability measure. The sparse depth samples are then drawn according to this reliability distribution. We integrate this sampling method with the Marigold-DC diffusion-based depth completion model and evaluate it on NYU Depth v2 using the standard metrics. Experiments show that our geometry-aware sparse depth improves accuracy, reduces artifacts near edges and discontinuities, and produces more realistic training conditions that better reflect real sensor behavior."

This coupling is also responsible for the appearance of bianisotropy, where electric and magnetic responses become interconnected through the interaction of their respective modes. In this work, we develop a simple and general temporal coupled-mode theory model to describe off-diagonal chiral bianisotropy. Using quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BICs), we demonstrate how to control the hybridization of modes with opposite symmetries, resulting in Rabi-like splitting between the hybrid states in the regime of strong electromagnetic mode coupling. Beyond revealing the physical origin of the hybrid modes, our model predicts and explains the emergence of dual-band asymmetric reflection and absorption, and how to achieve maximum directional absorption difference. The theoretical predictions are verified by full-wave simulations, showing very good agreement with theory. Furthermore, very strong reciprocal bianisotropy is demonstrated with the use of q-BICs in a deeply subwavelength metasurface in the optical frequency range. Our results provide a clear physical picture of the interaction process between modes, offering a compact theoretical framework for understanding and designing bianisotropic dielectric metasurfaces not only in the traditional regime but also in the strong coupling regime."

We propose a scheme by which such terms can be reintroduced into already constructed functionals without significantly affecting other constraints and norms. We implement this scheme on the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) functional to construct a $\\nabla ζ$-corrected version of SCAN. The resulting functional is shown to provide improvements in transition-metal atoms and molecules without significantly affecting SCAN's accurate description of $sp$-systems.

Rather than uniformly brightening the scene, LiDAS dynamically predicts an optimal illumination field that maximizes downstream perception performance, i.e., decreasing light on empty areas to reallocate it on object regions. LiDAS enables zero-shot nighttime generalization of daytime-trained models through adaptive illumination control. Trained on synthetic data and deployed zero-shot in real-world closed-loop driving scenarios, LiDAS enables +18.7% mAP50 and +5.0% mIoU over standard low-beam at equal power. It maintains performances while reducing energy use by 40%. LiDAS complements domain-generalization methods, further strengthening robustness without retraining. By turning readily available headlights into active vision actuators, LiDAS offers a cost-effective solution to robust nighttime perception."

    "abstract": "When a moving gravitational-wave (GW) source travels behind a massive astrophysical object, its signal is gravitationally lensed, showing a waveform distortion similar to a Paczyński curve. We present a first study of the lensing signature of a massive black hole (MBH) on a frequency-dependent GW signal from a moving binary merger. For both light and GW sources in a Keplerian circular orbit around a MBH lens, the self-lensing geometry breaks the microlensing degeneracy in the Einstein radius crossing timescale $t_{\\rm E}$. The duration of the curve ($2 t_{\\rm E}$) becomes independent on the MBH mass $M_{\\rm MBH}$, and provides a direct measure of the distance $d_{\\rm LS}$ to the MBH. However, $M_{\\rm MBH}$ remains unknown. We show that, in GW signals, the redshifted mass $M_{{\\rm MBH},z}$ can additionally be obtained from the interference pattern, by measuring the modulation period $T$, the GW frequency $f$, and $t_{\\rm E}$: $M_{{\\rm MBH},z}\\simeq 2.5\\times 10^6\\,M_\\odot\\,(t_{\\rm E}/[100\\,{\\rm s}])\\,(f\\,T)^{-1}$. If this lensing signature is not considered, it may be confused with other waveform distortions, especially in the modeling of overlapping signals in next generation ground-based GW detectors. The observation of one of these curves and its associated parameters may help (1) constrain the orbital distance $d_{\\rm LS}$ of sources, especially around low mass MBHs at the centers of star clusters and galaxies, (2) additionally estimate the mass $M_{{\\rm MBH},z}$ of these MBHs, and (3) infer the orbital inclination of the binary. Simultaneously obtaining $d_{\\rm LS}$ and $M_{{\\rm MBH},z}$ through self-lensing can help constrain the astrophysical environments where GW signals come from."

Existing hallucination detection methods for RAG often rely either on large-scale detector training, which requires substantial annotated data, or on querying external LLM judges, which leads to high inference costs. Although some approaches attempt to leverage internal representations of LLMs for hallucination detection, their accuracy remains limited. Motivated by recent advances in mechanistic interpretability, we employ sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle internal activations, successfully identifying features that are specifically triggered during RAG hallucinations. Building on a systematic pipeline of information-based feature selection and additive feature modeling, we introduce RAGLens, a lightweight hallucination detector that accurately flags unfaithful RAG outputs using LLM internal representations. RAGLens not only achieves superior detection performance compared to existing methods, but also provides interpretable rationales for its decisions, enabling effective post-hoc mitigation of unfaithful RAG. Finally, we justify our design choices and reveal new insights into the distribution of hallucination-related signals within LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/RAGLens."

Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy. Furthermore, the presence of hyperparameters in online models exacerbates this issue. These parameters are typically fixed and cannot be dynamically adjusted by the user in response to the evolving data distribution. Gaussian Process (GP) models offer powerful non-parametric regression capabilities with uncertainty quantification, making them ideal for modeling complex data relationships in an online setting. However, conventional online GP methods face several critical limitations, including a lack of drift-awareness, reliance on fixed hyperparameters, vulnerability to data snooping, absence of a principled decay mechanism, and memory inefficiencies. In response, we propose DAO-GP (Drift-Aware Online Gaussian Process), a novel, fully adaptive, hyperparameter-free, decayed, and sparse non-linear regression model. DAO-GP features a built-in drift detection and adaptation mechanism that dynamically adjusts model behavior based on the severity of drift. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm DAO-GP's robustness across stationary conditions, diverse drift types (abrupt, incremental, gradual), and varied data characteristics. Analyses demonstrate its dynamic adaptation, efficient in-memory and decay-based management, and evolving inducing points. Compared with state-of-the-art parametric and non-parametric models, DAO-GP consistently achieves superior or competitive performance, establishing it as a drift-resilient solution for online non-linear regression."

Second, some benchmarks are not built from real user queries.

Through this pipeline, we introduce SimpleDevQA, a multilingual benchmark derived from real user dialogues. It contains 2,740 QA pairs in three languages (English, Chinese, and Russian), and focuses on questions with unique, short, and verifiable answers for accurate and simple evaluation. Experiments show that: Code LLMs generally outperform general LLMs of similar scale; Knowledge injection with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy can boost LLM accuracy by 11.3% on average; LLMs show systematic overconfidence in Dev Knowledge QA, and the answering accuracy of LLMs shows a positive correlation with their stated confidence; Generally, LLMs with stronger code generation performance also exhibit stronger performance in Dev Knowledge QA."

To test verifiability and control, we evaluate four recent VLMs using a single, fixed prompt whose guardrail explicitly describes a surrounding square border, enabling correct answers via homography. We evaluate six simple tasks over binary and continuous targets, and observe that the overall accuracy with respect to 3D ground truth is modest, ~69% on average (best ~75%, worst ~64%). The same responses align even more closely with 2D projections in the image plane, where mean accuracy is ~72%.

Additionally, overall VLM accuracy degrades by ~4.1% under camera tilt. This demonstrates that models fail to correctly utilize the explicit frame-of-reference hint provided in the prompt and default to 2D image plane cues. Finally, we find that object interference has no significant effect on VLM accuracy."

    "abstract": "We seek to conduct statistical inference for a large collection of primary parameters, each with its own nuisance parameters. Our approach is partially Bayesian, in that we treat the primary parameters as fixed while we model the nuisance parameters as random and drawn from an unknown distribution which we endow with a nonparametric prior. We compute partially Bayes p-values by conditioning on nuisance parameter statistics, that is, statistics that are ancillary for the primary parameters and informative about the nuisance parameters. The proposed p-values have a Bayesian interpretation as tail areas computed with respect to the posterior distribution of the nuisance parameters. Similarly to the conditional predictive p-values of Bayarri and Berger, the partially Bayes p-values avoid double use of the data (unlike posterior predictive p-values). A key ingredient of our approach is that we model nuisance parameters hierarchically across problems; the sharing of information across problems leads to improved calibration. We illustrate the proposed partially Bayes p-values in two applications: the normal means problem with unknown variances and a location-scale model with unknown distribution shape. We model the scales via Dirichlet processes in both examples and the distribution shape via Pólya trees in the second. Our proposed partially Bayes p-values increase power and calibration compared to purely frequentist alternatives."

We propose a novel method for constructing prediction intervals using conformal inference techniques for time-varying ITEs with weaker assumptions than prior literature. We guarantee a lower bound for coverage, which is dependent on the degree of non-exchangeability in the data. Although our method is broadly applicable across decision-making contexts, we support our theoretical claims with simulations emulating micro-randomized trials (MRTs) -- a sequential experimental design for mobile health (mHealth) studies.

This configuration, called CIEMAT-QI4X, has been obtained by building on the optimization strategy and sophisticating the methods employed in [Sánchez E. et al 2023 Nucl. Fusion 63 066037]. The optimization has been improved by incorporating metrics to control Mercier stability and by enforcing strict constraints on the rotational transform profile to achieve nested toroidal surfaces in the confinement region and a divertor island structure at the plasma edge. Specifically, CIEMAT-QI4X has a 4/4 island chain at the edge that is resilient at least up to $β=4\\%$, even when the bootstrap current is included. A corresponding set of filamentary coils is presented that generates the configuration with enough accuracy to preserve the aforementioned physics properties. In terms of physics performance, CIEMAT-QI4X establishes as a candidate for a stellarator fusion reactor design."

Significant progress has been made in constraining what fraction of SNe Ic-BL may power high- or low-luminosity GRBs when viewed at small off-axis angles. However, the GRB-SN connection still lacks a complete understanding in the broader context of massive-star evolution and explosion physics. Models predict a continuum of outcomes for the fastest ejecta, from choked to ultra-relativistic jets, and observations from radio to X-rays are key to probing these scenarios across a range of viewing angles and velocities. Here, we present results from a coordinated radio-to-X-ray campaign targeting nearby (z<=0.1) SNe Ic-BL designed to explore this diversity. With eight new radio-monitored events and updated data for one previously observed SN, we further tighten constraints on the fraction of SNe Ic-BL as relativistic as SN 1998bw/GRB 980425. We identify SN 2024rjw as a new radio-loud event likely powered by strong interaction with circumstellar material (CSM), and add evidence supporting a similar interpretation for SN 2020jqm. We also establish new limits on the properties of radio-emitting ejecta with velocities consistent with cocoons from choked jets, highlighting SN 2022xxf as a promising cocoon-dominated candidate. These results refine our understanding of the continuum linking ordinary SNe Ic-BL, engine-driven explosions, and GRBs, and contribute to building a sample that will inform future multi-messenger searches for electromagnetic counterparts to high-energy neutrinos."

    "abstract": "Understanding human personality is crucial for web applications such as personalized recommendation and mental health assessment. Existing studies on personality detection predominantly adopt a \"posts -> user vector -> labels\" modeling paradigm, which encodes social media posts into user representations for predicting personality labels (e.g., MBTI labels). While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved text encoding capacities, these approaches remain constrained by limited supervision signals due to label scarcity, and under-specified semantic mappings between user language and abstract psychological constructs. We address these challenges by proposing ROME, a novel framework that explicitly injects psychological knowledge into personality detection. Inspired by standardized self-assessment tests, ROME leverages LLMs' role-play capability to simulate user responses to validated psychometric questionnaires. These generated question-level answers transform free-form user posts into interpretable, questionnaire-grounded evidence linking linguistic cues to personality labels, thereby providing rich intermediate supervision to mitigate label scarcity while offering a semantic reasoning chain that guides and simplifies the text-to-personality mapping learning. A question-conditioned Mixture-of-Experts module then jointly routes over post and question representations, learning to answer questionnaire items under explicit supervision. The predicted answers are summarized into an interpretable answer vector and fused with the user representation for final prediction within a multi-task learning framework, where question answering serves as a powerful auxiliary task for personality detection. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that ROME consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements (15.41% on Kaggle dataset)."

    "abstract": "Understanding objects is fundamental to computer vision. Beyond object recognition that provides only a category label as typical output, in-depth object understanding represents a comprehensive perception of an object category, involving its components, appearance characteristics, inter-category relationships, contextual background knowledge, etc. Developing such capability requires sufficient multi-modal data, including visual annotations such as parts, attributes, and co-occurrences for specific tasks, as well as textual knowledge to support high-level tasks like reasoning and question answering. However, these data are generally task-oriented and not systematically organized enough to achieve the expected understanding of object categories. In response, we propose the Visual Knowledge Base that structures multi-modal object knowledge as graphs, and present a construction framework named VisKnow that extracts multi-modal, object-level knowledge for object understanding. This framework integrates enriched aligned text and image-source knowledge with region annotations at both object and part levels through a combination of expert design and large-scale model application. As a specific case study, we construct AnimalKB, a structured animal knowledge base covering 406 animal categories, which contains 22K textual knowledge triplets extracted from encyclopedic documents, 420K images, and corresponding region annotations. A series of experiments showcase how AnimalKB enhances object-level visual tasks such as zero-shot recognition and fine-grained VQA, and serves as challenging benchmarks for knowledge graph completion and part segmentation. Our findings highlight the potential of automatically constructing visual knowledge bases to advance visual understanding and its practical applications.

Simulations have demonstrated that a laser pulse can undergo large frequency shifts, limited only by the drive beam energy, when the plasma density is tailored to match the accelerating phase of the wake to the group velocity of the pulse. Here, we study the dynamical evolution of photons in the phase-space vicinity of the plasma wake-phase matching condition. Numerical calculations using a photon kinetic model are validated by direct comparison with full electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations. These calculations form the basis of a linear theory of the photon dynamics which reveals several important results, including scalings for the properties of the witness pulse and a self-similar solution for the photon phase-space dynamics. One prediction of the theory is that the pulse can be compressed indefinitely with no lower bound on the duration. This predication suggests that photon acceleration can provide a novel source of sub-femtosecond, short wavelength radiation."

These estimators, however, have not yet found widespread application in studies of interactions between real-world systems. Here, we revisit the concept of transcripts and showcase the usage of transcript-based estimators for a time-series-based investigation of interactions between coupled paradigmatic dynamical systems of varying complexity. At the example of a time-resolved analysis of multichannel and multiday recordings of ongoing human brain dynamics, we demonstrate the potential of the methods to provide novel insights into the intricate spatial-temporal interactions in the human brain underlying different vigilance states."

The method is built on a multisymplectic variational principle discretized over a full space-time domain. Flow variables are encoded on a staggered space-time mesh, leveraging the principles of mimetic spectral element discretization. Unlike standard Lagrangian methods, which are prone to mesh distortion, this framework computes fluid deformations in a fixed reference configuration and systematically maps them to the physical domain via the Piola-Kirchhoff stress. Further, the structure preserving design ensures that the discrete analogues of the fundamental conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy are satisfied up to machine precision. The formulation also inherently handles low-Mach number flows without specialized preconditioning. Numerical experiments on expansion and compression flows confirm the accuracy, stability, and exact conservation properties of the discretization."

After performing an evaluation in several domains, it is highly informative to compute a (weighted) mean performance and, as shown in this paper, to scrutinize what happens during this averaging. To achieve this goal, we adopt a probabilistic framework and consider a performance as a probability measure (e.g., a normalized confusion matrix for a classification task). It appears that the corresponding weighted mean is known to be the summarization, and that only some remarkable scores assign to the summarized performance a value equal to a weighted arithmetic mean of the values assigned to the domain-specific performances. These scores include the family of ranking scores, a continuum parameterized by user preferences, and that the weights to consider in the arithmetic mean depend on the user preferences. Based on this, we rigorously define four domains, named easiest, most difficult, preponderant, and bottleneck domains, as functions of user preferences. After establishing the theory in a general setting, regardless of the task, we develop new visual tools for two-class classification."

The framework features autonomous topic and sensor detection, modular configuration with four severity tiers (light--extreme), and real-time performance (less than 20 ms per frame) compatible with ROS workflows. Experimental validation across three lidar architectures and five state-of-the-art SLAM systems reveals distinct robustness patterns shaped by sensor design and environmental context.

NQS are an asymptotically unbiased variational ground-state ansatz that employs neural networks to capture long-range correlations on complicated graph structures. We leverage this ability to solve multi-orbital impurity problems using a systematically improvable Segmented Commutator Operator-Lanczos (SCOL) construction.

The proposed approach was evaluated through extensive simulations emulating real-world conditions in scenarios involving up to 10 UAVs and velocities of up to 25 m/s, and in real-world experiments with accelerations up to 30 m/s$^2$. Comparison with state of the art shows 31% improvement in terms of flight time reduction in challenging scenarios, while maintaining a collision-free navigation in all trials."

    "abstract": "The Kirchhoff plate model plays a vital role in modeling, computing and analyzing the mechanical behaviors of thin plate structures. This study propose a novel fourth-order multi-scale (FOMS) computational method for high-accuracy and efficient simulation of composite Kirchhoff plates with highly periodic heterogeneities. At first, two-scale asymptotic expansion theory is employed to establish the high-accuracy fourth-order multi-scale computation model with novel fourth-order correctors for composite Kirchhoff plates, which are governed by fourth-order partial differential equation (PDE) with periodically oscillatory and highly discontinuous coefficients. Then, the locally point-wise error analysis is derived to theoretically illustrate the local balance preserving of fourth-order multi-scale model enabling high-accuracy multi-scale computation. Furthermore, a global error estimation with an explicit order for fourth-order multi-scale solutions is first demonstrated under appropriate assumptions. In contrast to the second- and third-order multi-scale solutions, only the fourth-order one is capable of providing an explicit error order estimate. Additionally, an efficient numerical algorithm is developed to conduct high-accuracy simulation for heterogeneous plate structures. Extensive numerical examples are provided to confirm the theoretical results for the computational convergence and accuracy of the proposed method. This work offers a higher-order (fourth-order) multi-scale computational framework that enables robust simulation and high-accuracy analysis to composite Kirchhoff plates."

    "abstract": "Video recordings of open surgeries are greatly required for education and research purposes. However, capturing unobstructed videos is challenging since surgeons frequently block the camera field of view. To avoid occlusion, the positions and angles of the camera must be frequently adjusted, which is highly labor-intensive. Prior work has addressed this issue by installing multiple cameras on a shadowless lamp and arranging them to fully surround the surgical area. This setup increases the chances of some cameras capturing an unobstructed view. However, manual image alignment is needed in post-processing since camera configurations change every time surgeons move the lamp for optimal lighting. This paper aims to fully automate this alignment task. The proposed method identifies frames in which the lighting system moves, realigns them, and selects the camera with the least occlusion to generate a video that consistently presents the surgical field from a fixed perspective. A user study involving surgeons demonstrated that videos generated by our method were superior to those produced by conventional methods in terms of the ease of confirming the surgical area and the comfort during video viewing. Additionally, our approach showed improvements in video quality over existing techniques. Furthermore, we implemented several synthesis options for the proposed view-synthesis method and conducted a user study to assess surgeons' preferences for each option."

    "abstract": "Finite-element (FE) discretisations have emerged as a powerful real-space alternative to large-scale Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) calculations, offering systematic convergence, excellent parallel scalability, while accommodating generic boundary conditions. However, the dominant computational bottleneck in FE-based DFT arises from the repeated application of the discretised sparse Hamiltonian to large blocks of trial vectors during iterations in an iterative eigensolver. Traditional sparse matrix-vector multiplications and FE cell-matrix approaches encounter memory limitations and high data-movement overheads, particularly at higher polynomial orders, typically used in DFT calculations. To overcome these challenges, this work develops matrix-free algorithms for FE-discretised DFT that substantially accelerate these products by doing on-the-fly operations that utilize structured tensor contractions over 1D basis functions and quadrature data. A unified multilevel batched data layout that handles both real and complex-valued operators is introduced to maximise cache reuse and SIMD utilisation on Frontier (AVX2), Param Pravega (AVX512) and Fugaku (SVE). We also combine terms for optimal cache reuse, even-odd decomposition to reduce FLOP, and mixed-precision intrinsics. Extensive benchmarks show that for large multivector pseudopotential DFT calculations, the matrix-free kernels deliver 1.5-4x speedups over the state-of-the-art cell-matrix approach baselines. For all-electron DFT calculations, the matrix-free operator achieves gains of up to 5.8x due to its efficient implementation and superior arithmetic intensity. When integrated with an error-tolerant Chebyshev-filtered subspace iteration eigensolver, the matrix-free formalism yields substantial reductions in end-to-end time-to-solution using FE meshes that deliver desired accuracies in ground-state properties."

We achieve this by using a sliding time window with short strides and consider the temporal dimension by storing convolution results between passes. This allows us to ignore unchanged regions, significantly reducing the number of convolution operations per forward pass without sacrificing accuracy. This data reuse scheme introduces extreme sparsity to detection data. To exploit this sparsity, we extend our previous work on scatter-based convolutions to allow for data reuse, and as such propose Sparse Scatter-Based Convolution Algorithm with Temporal Data Recycling (SSCATeR). This operation treats incoming LiDAR data as a continuous stream and acts only on the changing parts of the point cloud. By doing so, we achieve the same results with as much as a 6.61-fold reduction in processing time. Our test results show that the feature maps output by our method are identical to those produced by traditional sparse convolution techniques, whilst greatly increasing the computational efficiency of the network."

It emphasizes a learner-centered approach that aligns gamification design with pedagogical goals, while mitigating risks such as the erosion of intrinsic motivation. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify ten widely discussed GDEs. Visual prototypes representing each element were developed, and a best-worst scaling (BWS) survey with 125 participants was administered to elicit preference rankings. Qualitative feedback was also collected to uncover motivational drivers. Learners consistently preferred GDEs that support learning processes directly-most notably progress bars, concept maps, immediate feedback, and achievements. Qualitative analysis revealed six recurring motivational themes, including visible progress, content relevance, and constructive feedback. The findings suggest that learners value gamification elements that are meaningfully integrated with educational content and support intrinsic motivation. Purpose-aligned gamification should prioritize tools that visualize learning progress and provide actionable feedback, rather than relying solely on extrinsic incentives."

This work introduces a hierarchical multi-agent architecture that distributes reasoning across a 64*64 grid of lightweight agents, supported by a selective oracle. A spatial curriculum progressively expands the operational region of the grid, ensuring that agents master easier central tasks before tackling harder peripheral ones. To improve reliability, the system integrates Negative Log-Likelihood as a measure of confidence, allowing the curriculum to prioritize regions where agents are both accurate and well calibrated. A Thompson Sampling curriculum manager adaptively chooses training zones based on competence and NLL-driven reward signals. We evaluate the approach on a spatially grounded Tower of Hanoi benchmark, which mirrors the long-horizon structure of many robotic manipulation and planning tasks. Results demonstrate improved stability, reduced oracle usage, and stronger long-range reasoning from distributed agent cooperation."

In this paper, we define a new quaternion Wasserstein distance and develop its dual theory. To deal with the quaternion linear programming problem, we derive the strong duality form with helps of quaternion convex set separation theorem and quaternion Farkas lemma. With using quaternion Wasserstein distance, we propose a novel Wasserstein quaternion generative adversarial network. Experiments demonstrate that this novel model surpasses both the (quaternion) generative adversarial networks and the Wasserstein generative adversarial network in terms of generation efficiency and image quality."

Thermal fluctuations are taken into account within the framework of the self-consistent functional-integral theory. It is established that when the nodal points are located far inside (outside) the Fermi contour of the normal phase, thermal fluctuations expand the relative temperature ranges in which the values of the topological index are close to integer values C1=4(-2). This expansion depends both on the value of the topological index and on the magnitude of the effective attraction between the electrons. However, as the nodal points approach the Fermi contour, topological crossovers to new C1 values are observed, which can persist over a wide temperature range. The nature and degree of influence of thermal fluctuations on these crossovers are established. It is assumed that the observed effects may also manifest in the edge state behavior of a similar system with open boundaries."

We compare our diffuse sky model estimates against those derived from the models widely used in the community (e.g. pysm3 and GSM) employing external datasets that were not included in the estimation process. Our evaluation focuses on identifying the enhanced consistency at both the map level and in pixel-to-pixel correlations, allowing for a more robust verification of our model's performance. We find our parametric, least-squares synchrotron estimate to be the most reliable across radio frequencies as it consistently provides sky models with average accuracies (when compared to empirical data) of around 20 per cent, whilst other model performances range on average between 10 and 70 per cent accurate.

Previous studies have developed various approaches to distinguish the SGWB from instrumental noise, often under simplified assumptions such as static or equal-arm configurations. However, in realistic scenarios, time-varying arm-lengths introduce additional complexities that require careful modeling. In this work, we investigate the impact of template construction on SGWB parameter estimation under realistic orbital configurations. Using the simulated SGWB signals and dominant instrumental noise sources, we compare three template strategies: time-averaged template constructed from segmented data, equal-arm template, and a template treating the arm-lengths as a free parameter. Our results show that the time-averaged template yield improves parameter estimation accuracy under time-varying arm-lengths, whereas introducing the effective arm-length as a free parameter increases estimation uncertainty. These findings highlight the importance of realistic template construction for high-precision SGWB analysis in future space-based missions."

Given binary treatments, the experimenter's goal is to choose the treatment with the highest expected outcome through an adaptive experiment, in order to maximize welfare. We consider adaptive experiments that consist of two phases, the treatment allocation phase and the treatment choice phase. The experiment starts with the treatment allocation phase, where the experimenter allocates treatments to experimental subjects to gather observations. During this phase, the experimenter can adaptively update the allocation probabilities using the observations obtained in the experiment. After the allocation phase, the experimenter proceeds to the treatment choice phase, where one of the treatments is selected as the best. For this adaptive experimental procedure, we propose an adaptive experiment that splits the treatment allocation phase into two stages, where we first estimate the standard deviations and then allocate each treatment proportionally to its standard deviation. We show that this experiment, often referred to as Neyman allocation, is minimax and Bayes optimal in the sense that its regret upper bounds exactly match the lower bounds that we derive. To show this optimality, we derive minimax and Bayes lower bounds for the regret using change-of-measure arguments. Then, we evaluate the corresponding upper bounds using the central limit theorem and large deviation bounds."

These models form the backbone of our understanding of accretion onto compact objects and successfully describe the phenomenology of black hole and neutron star X-ray binaries, as well as luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN), in the regime of high mass accretion rates. At luminosities approaching a significant fraction of the Eddington limit (L/LEdd > 0.1), standard thin disks are predicted to become thermally unstable due to the dominance of radiation pressure. This prediction has found empirical support in several Galactic stellar-mass black hole systems, where the instability manifests as quasi-periodic, large-amplitude luminosity oscillations, so-called \"heartbeat states\", and has been proposed as a driver of observed signatures of deterministic chaos in accretion-driven light curves. The scope of radiation-pressure-induced variability extends beyond stellar-mass black holes: both black holes across mass scales and accreting neutron stars can exhibit related behavior, though the presence of a boundary layer in neutron stars adds complexity and offers a unique laboratory for testing the interplay between accretion dynamics and the central object. On extragalactic scales, the instability has been invoked to explain the duty cycles and apparent short lifetimes of radio-loud AGN, as well as the dramatic spectral-state transitions seen in Changing-Look AGN.

This fraction, when combined with information about the neutron star mass distribution gleaned from the inspiral portion of the signals, provides an indirect measure of the neutron star maximum mass. Using conservative measures of the post-merger waveforms, we show that 50-70 events with binary neutron star inspiral measurements can be combined to give an $11-20\\%$ fractional uncertainty on the maximum mass of rapidly rotating, hot neutron stars, which can potentially be turned into a $12-21\\%$ fractional constraint on the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff mass.

    "abstract": "We investigate the Einstein-Hilbert black brane solution in four-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime supplemented by a quadratic Ricci scalar term $q L^2 R^2$, where $q$ is a dimensionless coupling constant and $L$ is the AdS radius. The shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, $\\fracη{s}$, is calculated holographically, and deviations from the universal Kovtun-Son-Starinets (KSS) bound are analyzed. Our results indicate that $\\fracη{s} = \\frac{1}{4π}(1 - 24q)$, demonstrating that the ratio falls below the conjectured lower limit for positive $q$, while it respects the bound for negative $q$. We confirm that our solutions smoothly reduce to the standard Einstein-Hilbert case when $q \\to 0$, consistent with expectations. The physical implications of violating the KSS bound are discussed in depth, particularly regarding stability, causality, and the strongly coupled nature of the dual field theory. These findings provide valuable insights into the influence of higher curvature terms on holographic transport properties."

Unlike conventional X-ray techniques, which average over the entire illuminated sample volume, SP-SAXS resolves low-contrast, less abundant, or transient species within heterogeneous particle populations that would otherwise remain hidden. Here, we apply SP-SAXS to investigate the solvothermal formation of CoO nanocrystal assemblies from a Co(acac)$_3$ precursor in benzyl alcohol. The single-particle data reveal amorphous, uniform-density Co(acac)$_2$ spheres as transient intermediates that directly crystallize into cavernous CoO nanocrystal assemblies, which explains why CoO forms as hierarchical aggregates rather than as isolated nanocrystals. These results demonstrate that SP-SAXS provides a powerful framework for disentangling morphological heterogeneity in nanoparticle formation processes."

    "abstract": "Understanding how humans respond to uncertainty is critical for designing safe and effective physical human-robot interaction (pHRI), as physically working with robots introduces multiple sources of uncertainty, including trust, comfort, and perceived safety. Conventional pHRI control frameworks typically build on optimal control theory, which assumes that human actions minimize a cost function; however, human behavior under uncertainty often departs from such optimal patterns. To address this gap, additional understanding of human behavior under uncertainty is needed. This pilot study implemented a physically coupled target-reaching task in which the robot delivered assistance or disturbances with systematically varied probabilities (10\\% to 90\\%). Analysis of participants' force inputs and decision-making strategies revealed two distinct behavioral clusters: a \"trade-off\" group that modulated their physical responses according to disturbance likelihood, and an \"always-compensate\" group characterized by strong risk aversion irrespective of probability. These findings provide empirical evidence that human decision-making in pHRI is highly individualized and that the perception of probability can differ to its true value. Accordingly, the study highlights the need for more interpretable behavioral models, such as cumulative prospect theory (CPT), to more accurately capture these behaviors and inform the design of future adaptive robot controllers."

However, existing viewer solutions remain fragmented, heavy, or constrained by legacy pipelines, resulting in high deployment friction and limited support for dynamic content and generative models. In this work, we present Visionary, an open, web-native platform for real-time various Gaussian Splatting and meshes rendering. Built on an efficient WebGPU renderer with per-frame ONNX inference, Visionary enables dynamic neural processing while maintaining a lightweight, \"click-to-run\" browser experience. It introduces a standardized Gaussian Generator contract, which not only supports standard 3DGS rendering but also allows plug-and-play algorithms to generate or update Gaussians each frame. Such inference also enables us to apply feedforward generative post-processing. The platform further offers a plug in three.js library with a concise TypeScript API for seamless integration into existing web applications. Experiments show that, under identical 3DGS assets, Visionary achieves superior rendering efficiency compared to current Web viewers due to GPU-based primitive sorting. It already supports multiple variants, including MLP-based 3DGS, 4DGS, neural avatars, and style transformation or enhancement networks. By unifying inference and rendering directly in the browser, Visionary significantly lowers the barrier to reproduction, comparison, and deployment of 3DGS-family methods, serving as a unified World Model Carrier for both reconstructive and generative paradigms."

    "abstract": "Drag-based image editing aims to modify visual content followed by user-specified drag operations. Despite existing methods having made notable progress, they still fail to fully exploit the contextual information in the reference image, including fine-grained texture details, leading to edits with limited coherence and fidelity. To address this challenge, we introduce ContextDrag, a new paradigm for drag-based editing that leverages the strong contextual modeling capability of editing models, such as FLUX-Kontext. By incorporating VAE-encoded features from the reference image, ContextDrag can leverage rich contextual cues and preserve fine-grained details, without the need for finetuning or inversion. Specifically, ContextDrag introduced a novel Context-preserving Token Injection (CTI) that injects noise-free reference features into their correct destination locations via a Latent-space Reverse Mapping (LRM) algorithm. This strategy enables precise drag control while preserving consistency in both semantics and texture details. Second, ContextDrag adopts a novel Position-Consistent Attention (PCA), which positional re-encodes the reference tokens and applies overlap-aware masking to eliminate interference from irrelevant reference features. Extensive experiments on DragBench-SR and DragBench-DR demonstrate that our approach surpasses all existing SOTA methods. Code will be publicly available."

    "abstract": "Designing autonomous driving systems requires efficient exploration of large hardware/software configuration spaces under diverse environmental conditions, e.g., with varying traffic, weather, and road layouts. Traditional design space exploration (DSE) approaches struggle with multi-modal execution outputs and complex performance trade-offs, and often require human involvement to assess correctness based on execution outputs. This paper presents a multi-agent, large language model (LLM)-based DSE framework, which integrates multi-modal reasoning with 3D simulation and profiling tools to automate the interpretation of execution outputs and guide the exploration of system designs. Specialized LLM agents are leveraged to handle user input interpretation, design point generation, execution orchestration, and analysis of both visual and textual execution outputs, which enables identification of potential bottlenecks without human intervention. A prototype implementation is developed and evaluated on a robotaxi case study (an SAE Level 4 autonomous driving application). Compared with a genetic algorithm baseline, the proposed framework identifies more Pareto-optimal, cost-efficient solutions with reduced navigation time under the same exploration budget. Experimental results also demonstrate the efficiency of the adoption of the LLM-based approach for DSE. We believe that this framework paves the way to the design automation of autonomous driving systems."

To resolve this, we propose a new method based on Post-LN that induces algebraic smoothing, preventing over-smoothing without the curse of depth. Empirical results across five benchmarks demonstrate that our approach supports deeper networks (up to 256 layers) and improves performance, requiring no additional parameters. Key contributions: Theoretical Characterization: Analysis of LN dynamics and their impact on over-smoothing and the curse of depth. A Principled Solution: A parameter-efficient method that induces algebraic smoothing and avoids over-smoothing and the curse of depth.

    "abstract": "Many high-performance human activities are executed with little or no external feedback: think of a figure skater landing a triple jump, a pitcher throwing a curveball for a strike, or a barista pouring latte art. To study the process of skill acquisition under fully controlled conditions, we bypass human subjects. Instead, we directly interface a generalist reinforcement learning agent with a spinning cylinder in a tabletop circulating water channel to maximize or minimize drag. This setup has several desirable properties. First, it is a physical system, with the rich interactions and complex dynamics that only the physical world has: the flow is highly chaotic and extremely difficult, if not impossible, to model or simulate accurately. Second, the objective -- drag minimization or maximization -- is easy to state and can be captured directly in the reward, yet good strategies are not obvious beforehand. Third, decades-old experimental studies provide recipes for simple, high-performance open-loop policies. Finally, the setup is inexpensive and far easier to reproduce than human studies. In our experiments we find that high-dimensional flow feedback lets the agent discover high-performance drag-control strategies with only minutes of real-world interaction. When we later replay the same action sequences without any feedback, we obtain almost identical performance. This shows that feedback, and in particular flow feedback, is not needed to execute the learned policy. Surprisingly, without flow feedback during training the agent fails to discover any well-performing policy in drag maximization, but still succeeds in drag minimization, albeit more slowly and less reliably. Our studies show that learning a high-performance skill can require richer information than executing it, and learning conditions can be kind or wicked depending solely on the goal, not on dynamics or policy complexity."

As an application, we prove, for Toeplitz operators T_a with doubly periodic symbols, a spectral band formula, which describes the spectrum and essential spectrum of T_a in terms of the spectra of a family of Toeplitz-type operators on the cell B. Technical challenges arise from the fact that double quasiperiodic boundary conditions have to be taken into account in the definitions of the spaces and operators on the periodic cell B. This requires novel operator theoretic tools, which are based on modifications of certain elliptic functions, e.g. the Weierstrass p-function."

We address this issue by developing a novel tetrahedralization method that maintains input surface connectivity in the presence of such defects. We also present a metric to quantify the preservation of surface connectivity and demonstrate that our method correctly maintains connectivity compared to existing solutions."

Although traditional wave variable-based methods for a four-channel architecture ensure stability via passivity, they remain vulnerable to wave reflections and disturbances like variable delays and environmental noise. This article presents a data-driven hybrid framework that replaces the conventional wave-variable transform with an ensemble of three advanced sequence models, each optimized separately via the state-of-the-art Optuna optimizer, and combined through a stacking meta-learner. The base predictors include an LSTM augmented with Prophet for trend correction, an LSTM-based feature extractor paired with clustering and a random forest for improved regression, and a CNN-LSTM model for localized and long-term dynamics. Experimental validation was performed in Python using data generated from the baseline system implemented in MATLAB/Simulink. The results show that our optimized ensemble achieves a transparency comparable to the baseline wave-variable system under varying delays and noise, while ensuring stability through passivity constraints."

Existing studies mostly compare idealised great circle shortcuts or use full weather routing systems, leaving a gap for simple basin scale diagnostics on realistic bathymetry and sea ice. We develop an offline graph based framework on a 0.5 degree pan Arctic grid that combines GEBCO 2024 bathymetry with a summer 2018 Arctic sea ice reanalysis from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS). An A* pathfinding algorithm is applied to a canonical Europe Asia origin destination pair to quantify route availability and route length inflation relative to a great circle. Enforcing sea only feasibility increases route length by about 10 percent before depth and ice constraints are applied. Depth thresholds representative of under keel clearance (hmin = 20-50 m) remove up to roughly 15 percent of the sea mask but preserve a trans Arctic connection for hmin = 20 m. Summer sea ice exerts a strong seasonal control: continuous ice safe routes emerge only from mid August, with distances inflated by roughly 20-25 percent even in late summer. When depth and ice constraints are imposed jointly, only about 75 percent of sea cells remain safe and no continuous joint safe trans Arctic route exists in the tested season. The framework provides a basin scale screening tool for Arctic shipping and a baseline for forecast driven, multi objective routing studies."

In this paper, we reformulate the unstructured search as a maximization problem on the unitary manifold and solve it via the Riemannian gradient ascent (RGA) method. To overcome the difficulty that generic RGA updates do not, in general, correspond to physically implementable quantum operators, we introduce Grover-compatible retractions to restrict RGA updates to valid oracle and diffusion operators. Theoretically, we establish a local Riemannian $μ$-Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) inequality with $μ= \\tfrac{1}{2}$, which yields a linear convergence rate of $1 - κ^{-1}$ toward the global solution. Here, the condition number $κ= L_{\\mathrm{Rie}} / μ$, where $L_{\\mathrm{Rie}}$ denotes the Riemannian Lipschitz constant of the gradient. Taking into account both the geometry of the unitary manifold and the special structure of the cost function, we show that $L_{\\mathrm{Rie}} = O(\\sqrt{N})$ for problem size $N = 2^n$. Consequently, the resulting iteration complexity is $O(\\sqrt{N} \\log(1/\\varepsilon))$ for attaining an $\\varepsilon$-accurate solution, which matches the quadratic speedup of $O(\\sqrt{N})$ achieved by Grover's algorithm. These results demonstrate that an optimization-based viewpoint can offer fresh conceptual insights and lead to new advances in the design of quantum algorithms."

The underlying optimization problem is solved with the Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming algorithm which is applicable to various specifications of storages, and it allows for e.g. hard constraints on storage capacity and charging speed. We illustrate the approach in intraday trading where the agent charges or discharges a battery over a finite number of delivery periods, and the electricity prices are subject to bid-ask spreads and significant uncertainty. Optimal strategies are found in a matter of minutes on a regular PC. We find that the corresponding trading strategies and battery valuations vary consistently with respect to the agent's risk preferences as well as the physical characteristics of the battery."

To further optimize the performance, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and a hybrid ANN-PSO methodology are implemented. These strategies aim to refine the reference rotational speed of the turbine while minimizing deviations from optimal power extraction conditions. The simulation results of a tidal turbine operating at a water flow velocity of 1.5 m/s demonstrate that the PSO-based control approach significantly enhances the voltage stability compared to conventional MPPT-TSR and ANN-Fuzzy controllers.

Traditional deep learning methods have been widely applied to this task but often lack generalisability when confronted with newly emerging spoofing techniques and more tasks such as spoof attribution recognition rather than simple binary classification. In principle, Large Language Models (LLMs) are considered to possess the needed generalisation capabilities. However, previous research on Audio LLMs (ALLMs) indicates a generalization bottleneck in audio deepfake detection performance, even when sufficient data is available. Consequently, this study investigates the model architecture and examines the effects of the primary components of ALLMs, namely the audio encoder and the text-based LLM. Our experiments demonstrate that the careful selection and combination of audio encoders and text-based LLMs are crucial for unlocking the deepfake detection potential of ALLMs. We further propose an ALLM structure capable of generalizing deepfake detection abilities to out-of-domain spoofing tests and other deepfake tasks, such as spoof positioning and spoof attribution recognition. Our proposed model architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets, including ASVSpoof2019, InTheWild, and Demopage, with accuracy reaching up to 95.76% on average, and exhibits competitive capabilities in other deepfake detection tasks such as attribution, and localisation compared to SOTA audio understanding models.

A proof of concept is presented using synthetic data, where the PINN is trained to infer the flow fields while simultaneously recovering the rheological parameters. Beyond parameter identification, the method also enables reconstruction of the pressure field, which is difficult to access experimentally. The results highlight the potential of PINNs for data-driven rheometry of granular materials and open perspectives for future applications with real experimental data."

    "abstract": "Van der Waals (vdW) crystals offer unique opportunities for modern nanophotonic applications owing to their intrinsic anisotropic nature. While most of them exhibit uniaxial anisotropy arising from weak out-of-plane vdW interaction, some of their representative families also exhibit an in-plane biaxial anisotropy. Among the latter, outstand vdW oxochlorides with in-plane axes of a different physical character (metallic or dielectric). Here, we present an accurate dynamics of dielectric permittivity tensor components of vdW MoOCl2 in the ultraviolet (UV) to visible (Vis) spectral region partly covering near-infrared (NIR). Addressing its enormously anisotropic optical constants, we focus on another hyperbolicity window of vdW MoOCl2 emerging in the UV spectral region that may potentially unlock rich light-matter interaction effects. Furthermore, we propose an approach towards designing nanoscale handedness preserved Vis light circular polarizers based on twisted helical vdW MoOCl2 heterostructures. Our findings display that vdW MoOCl2 provides a highly promising platform not only for hyperbolic, but also for chiral nanophotonic applications."

    "abstract": "Under challenging light conditions, captured images often suffer from various degradations, leading to a decline in the performance of vision-based applications. Although numerous methods have been proposed to enhance image quality, they either significantly amplify inherent noise or are only effective under specific illumination conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for simultaneous enhancement and noise suppression under complex illumination conditions. Firstly, a gradient-domain weighted guided filter (GDWGIF) is employed to accurately estimate illumination and improve image quality. Next, the Retinex model is applied to decompose the captured image into separate illumination and reflection layers. These layers undergo parallel processing, with the illumination layer being corrected to optimize lighting conditions and the reflection layer enhanced to improve image quality. Finally, the dynamic range of the image is optimized through multi-exposure fusion and a linear stretching strategy. The proposed method is evaluated on real-world datasets obtained from practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in both contrast enhancement and noise suppression."

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which couple pre-trained vision encoders and language models, have shown remarkable capabilities. However, their reliance on the ubiquitous Pre-Norm architecture introduces a subtle yet critical flaw: a severe norm disparity between the high-norm visual tokens and the low-norm text tokens. In this work, we present a formal theoretical analysis demonstrating that this imbalance is not a static issue. Instead, it induces an ``asymmetric update dynamic,'' where high-norm visual tokens exhibit a ``representational inertia,'' causing them to transform semantically much slower than their textual counterparts. This fundamentally impairs effective cross-modal feature fusion. Our empirical validation across a range of mainstream MLLMs confirms that this theoretical dynamic -- the persistence of norm disparity and the resulting asymmetric update rates -- is a prevalent phenomenon. Based on this insight, we propose a remarkably simple yet effective solution: inserting a single, carefully initialized LayerNorm layer after the visual projector to enforce norm alignment. Experiments conducted on the LLaVA-1.5 architecture show that this intervention yields significant performance gains not only on a wide suite of multimodal benchmarks but also, notably, on text-only evaluations such as MMLU, suggesting that resolving the architectural imbalance leads to a more holistically capable model."

    "abstract": "Biological systems exhibit remarkable morphogenetic plasticity, where a single genome can encode various specialized cellular structures triggered by local chemical signals. In the domain of Deep Learning, Differentiable Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) have emerged as a paradigm to mimic this self-organization. However, existing NCA research has predominantly focused on continuous texture synthesis or single-target object recovery, leaving the challenge of class-conditional structural generation largely unexplored. In this work, we propose a novel Conditional Neural Cellular Automata (c-NCA) architecture capable of growing distinct topological structures - specifically MNIST digits - from a single generic seed, guided solely by a spatially broadcasted class vector. Unlike traditional generative models (e.g., GANs, VAEs) that rely on global reception fields, our model enforces strict locality and translation equivariance. We demonstrate that by injecting a one-hot condition into the cellular perception field, a single set of local rules can learn to break symmetry and self-assemble into ten distinct geometric attractors. Experimental results show that our c-NCA achieves stable convergence, correctly forming digit topologies from a single pixel, and exhibits robustness characteristic of biological systems. This work bridges the gap between texture-based NCAs and structural pattern formation, offering a lightweight, biologically plausible alternative for conditional generation."

To address these two limitations, we propose TrackingWorld, a novel pipeline for dense 3D tracking of almost all pixels within a world-centric 3D coordinate system. First, we introduce a tracking upsampler that efficiently lifts the arbitrary sparse 2D tracks into dense 2D tracks. Then, to generalize the current tracking methods to newly emerging objects, we apply the upsampler to all frames and reduce the redundancy of 2D tracks by eliminating the tracks in overlapped regions. Finally, we present an efficient optimization-based framework to back-project dense 2D tracks into world-centric 3D trajectories by estimating the camera poses and the 3D coordinates of these 2D tracks. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our system achieves accurate and dense 3D tracking in a world-centric coordinate frame."

    "abstract": "In an emerging pandemic, policymakers need to make important decisions with limited information, for example choosing between a mitigation, suppression or elimination strategy. These strategies may require trade-offs to be made between the health impact of the pandemic and the economic costs of the interventions introduced in response. Mathematical models are a useful tool that can help understand the consequences of alternative policy options on the future dynamics and impact of the epidemic. Most models have focused on direct health impacts, neglecting the economic costs of control measures. Here, we introduce a model framework that captures both health and economic costs. We use this framework to compare the expected aggregate costs of mitigation, suppression and elimination strategies, across a range of different epidemiological and economic parameters. We find that for diseases with low severity, mitigation tends to be the most cost-effective option. For more severe diseases, suppression tends to be most cost effective if the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is relatively low, while elimination tends to be more cost-effective if $R_0$ is high. We use the example of New Zealand's elimination response to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 to anchor our framework to a real-world case study. We find that parameter estimates for Covid-19 in New Zealand put it close to or above the threshold at which elimination becomes more cost-effective than mitigation. We conclude that our proposed framework holds promise as a decision-support tool for future pandemic threats, although further work is needed to account for population heterogeneity and other factors relevant to decision-making."

    "abstract": "Minimizing transmission delay in wireless multi-hop networks is a fundamental yet challenging task due to the complex coupling among interference, queue dynamics, and distributed control. Traditional scheduling algorithms, such as max-weight or queue-length-based policies, primarily aim to optimize throughput but often suffer from high latency, especially in heterogeneous or dynamically changing topologies. Recent learning-based approaches, particularly those employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have shown promise in capturing spatial interference structures. However, conventional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) remain limited by their local aggregation mechanism and their inability to model long-range dependencies within the conflict graph. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a delay-oriented distributed scheduling framework based on Transformer GNN. The proposed model employs an attention-based graph encoder to generate adaptive per-link utility scores that reflect both queue backlog and interference intensity. A Local Greedy Solver (LGS) then utilizes these utilities to construct a feasible independent set of links for transmission, ensuring distributed and conflict-free scheduling."

    "abstract": "We investigated injection locking in spin-wave active ring oscillators (SWAROs) operating in the multi-mode regime. By applying external RF signals with varying frequency and power, we identified the locking behavior of individual modes and extracted the total locking ranges from spectral measurements. The results show asymmetric evolution of the lower and upper locking boundaries with drive power for the lower-frequency SWARO modes, while the highest-frequency mode exhibits nearly symmetric behavior. A maxi- mum locking range of over 11 MHz is observed at a drive power of -10 dBm. To interpret these results, we develop an Adler-like model that captures the dependence of the locking range on drive power, showing good agreement for the higher-frequency modes. For the lowest-frequency mode, however, the model underestimates the locking range at low drive and saturates at high drive power levels, while the experimental range increases mono- tonically, indicating the influence of multi-mode interactions. These findings establish SWARO as a useful platform for exploring injection phenomena in spin-wave ring systems with delayed feedback and motivate the development of extended injection models that account for multi-mode dynamics."

In this work, we examine the limits of large populations of the Moran process (a finite-population birth-death process) and the replicator equation (an ordinary differential equation) as paradigmatic examples of finite and infinite population models, respectively, both of which are extensively used in population genetics. Except for certain degenerate cases, we completely characterize when these models exhibit similar dynamics, i.e., when there is a one-to-one relation between the stable attractors of the replicator equations and the metastable states of the Moran process. To achieve this goal, we first show that the asymptotic expression for the fixation probability in the Moran process, when the population size is large and individual interaction is almost arbitrary (including cases modeled through $d$-player game theory), is a convex combination of the asymptotic approximations obtained in the constant fitness case or 2-player game theory. We discuss several examples and the inverse problem, i.e., how to derive a Moran process that is compatible with a given replicator dynamics. In particular, we prove that modeling a Moran process with an inner metastable state may require the use of $d$-player game theory with possibly large $d$ values, depending on the precise location of the inner equilibrium."

We simulate low-SNR conditions by degrading the Noise-Equivalent Sigma Zero (NESZ) to $-15~\\mathrm{dB}$ and assess the resulting effects on interferometric coherence, phase unwrapping, and time series inversion. The displacement accuracy of 4mm in single interferogram can be achieved by taking looks for the signal decorrelation of 0.6 and SNR between -9dB to -10dB. Our findings indicate that even under low-SNR conditions, a velocity precision of $0.5~\\mathrm{cm/yr}$ can be achieved in comparison to high-SNR conditions. By applying multilooking with an 8x8 window, we significantly improve coherence and eliminate this bias, demonstrating that low-SNR systems can achieve comparable precision to high-SNR systems at the expense of spatial resolution.

We consider an enhanced primary control layer including droop control and autonomous limitation of power and energy.

    "abstract": "Hierarchical clustering and community detection are important problems in machine learning and complex network analysis. A common approach to identify clusters is to simply cut dendrograms at some threshold. However, single-level cuts are often suboptimal in terms of capturing underlying structure in the data, especially when the dendrogram is unbalanced. In this paper, we present the adaptive cut, a novel method that leverages the hierarchical structure of dendrograms by employing multi-level cuts to overcome the limitations of single-level approaches. The adaptive cut optimizes an objective function using a Markov chain Monte Carlo with simulated annealing, resulting in better partitions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive cut through applications to link clustering and modularity optimization, but note that the method is applicable to any clustering task that relies on a dendrogram and an objective function. Beyond the adaptive cut, we introduce the balancedness score, an information-theoretic metric that quantifies how balanced a dendrogram is. Balancedness predicts the potential benefits of using multi-level cuts. For the community detection examples, we evaluate our method on more than 200 real-world networks and multiple synthetic datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in partition density and modularity over traditional single-cut approaches. In addition, we show the generality of the adaptive cut by applying it across various hierarchical clustering techniques and objective functions. Our results indicate that the adaptive cut provides a robust and versatile tool for improving clustering outcomes."

This paper proposes a new paradigm of \"human-AI collaborative cognitive enhancement,\" aiming to transform the dual black boxes into a composable, auditable, and extensible \"functional white-box\" system through structured \"meta-interaction.\" The core breakthrough lies in the \"plug-and-play cognitive framework\"--a computable knowledge package that can be extracted from expert dialogues and loaded into the Recursive Adversarial Meta-Thinking Network (RAMTN). This enables expert thinking, such as medical diagnostic logic and teaching intuition, to be converted into reusable and scalable public assets, realizing a paradigm shift from \"AI as a tool\" to \"AI as a thinking partner.\" This work not only provides the first engineering proof for \"cognitive equity\" but also opens up a new path for AI governance: constructing a verifiable and intervenable governance paradigm through \"transparency of interaction protocols\" rather than prying into the internal mechanisms of models. The framework is open-sourced to promote technology for good and cognitive inclusion. This paper is an independent exploratory research conducted by the author. All content presented, including the theoretical framework (RAMTN), methodology (meta-interaction), system implementation, and case validation, constitutes the author's individual research achievements."

    "abstract": "The advancement of human healthspan and bioengineering relies heavily on predicting the behavior of complex biological systems. While high-throughput multiomics data is becoming increasingly abundant, converting this data into actionable predictive models remains a bottleneck. High-capacity, datadriven simulation systems are critical in this landscape; unlike classical mechanistic models restricted by prior knowledge, these architectures can infer latent interactions directly from observational data, allowing for the simulation of temporal trajectories and the anticipation of downstream intervention effects in personalized medicine and synthetic biology. To address this challenge, we introduce Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) as a dynamic framework for learning the complex interplay between the proteome and metabolome. We applied this framework to time-series data derived from engineered Escherichia coli strains, modeling the continuous dynamics of metabolic pathways. The proposed NODE architecture demonstrates superior performance in capturing system dynamics compared to traditional machine learning pipelines. Our results show a greater than 90% improvement in root mean squared error over baselines across both Limonene (up to 94.38% improvement) and Isopentenol (up to 97.65% improvement) pathway datasets. Furthermore, the NODE models demonstrated a 1000x acceleration in inference time, establishing them as a scalable, high-fidelity tool for the next generation of metabolic engineering and biological discovery."

The effective action approach we employ describes the regime where the brane sources are slightly separated. String probes see these backgrounds as smooth and effectively capped off at the scale of that separation. Within the space of solutions is a large ensemble of ultracompact objects exhibiting many of the features of extremal BTZ black holes, in particular having a deep $AdS_2$ throat. We present the details of solutions with circular source profiles, and compare them to known superstratum geometries. The separation of the sources makes them structurally more like BPS fivebrane stars than like extremal black hole microstates. When evaluated on the supergravity background, the brane effective action governs (chaotic) near-BPS dynamics, and exhibits a collective mode analogous to the Schwarzian mode of $AdS_2$ black holes. Finally, we discuss the approach to the black hole phase as the sources coalesce, in which the semiclassical approximation breaks down due to the appearance of light D-brane excitations; this bulk realization of the fivebrane deconfinement transition connects directly to the Hawking-Page transition."

Based on the limited space and cooling resources, this paper adopts the flexible graphene heat conducting cable and grooved heat pipes, and carries out detailed thermal design and thermal analysis of its cooling path. The finite element model is established by thermal analysis software and thermal simulation is carried out. in that steady state, the work temperature range of the CCD chip is -12.8 to -10.9 celsius, which meets the temperature control index, and the work temperatures of other components are also within the design requirements, which indicate that the thermal design scheme is reasonable and feasible, and meets the task requirements."

    "abstract": "Effects of General Relativity are usually neglected in the non-linear evolution of structures, where Newtonian $N$-body simulations are traditionally employed. In the post-Friedmann expansion framework, a weak-field relativistic approximation purpose-built for cosmology, a frame-dragging gravito-magnetic vector potential arises at leading order, sourced by momentum currents, contributing to the metric even if the dynamics of matter fields at this order is Newtonian, and can thus be extracted from $N$-body simulations. Using the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator code on the IllustrisTNG simulations, here we extend previous work in order to compute the power spectrum of this vector potential down to galactic scales. The magnitude of the vector potential is two orders of magnitude larger than predicted by perturbation theory, and is a $1\\% \\sim 0.1\\%$ effect compared to the non-linear Newtonian scalar gravitational potential. In the red-shift range considered here, the gravito-magnetic effect remains subdominant, without showing any enhancement during a particular phase in the evolution of structures, aside from the continuous growth of non-linearity at low redshift. Although this seems to suggest that, within the $Λ$CDM model, no significant gravito-magnetic effects contribute to the non-linear evolution of cosmic structures, i.e. to the dynamics of massive particles, possible observational consequences, e.g. in lensing, deserve further exploration."

However, directly applying these models to Full Surround Monocular Depth Estimation (FSMDE) presents two major challenges: (1) high computational cost, which limits real-time performance, and (2) difficulty in estimating metric-scale depth, as these models are typically trained to predict only relative depth. To address these limitations, we propose a novel knowledge distillation strategy that transfers robust depth knowledge from a foundation model to a lightweight FSMDE network. Our approach leverages a hybrid regression framework combining the knowledge distillation scheme--traditionally used in classification--with a depth binning module to enhance scale consistency. Specifically, we introduce a cross-interaction knowledge distillation scheme that distills the scale-invariant depth bin probabilities of a foundation model into the student network while guiding it to infer metric-scale depth bin centers from ground-truth depth. Furthermore, we propose view-relational knowledge distillation, which encodes structural relationships among adjacent camera views and transfers them to enhance cross-view depth consistency. Experiments on DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to conventional supervised methods and existing knowledge distillation approaches. Moreover, our method achieves a favorable trade-off between performance and efficiency, meeting real-time requirements."

Motivated by a toy model for quantum gravity to replace integration over metrics by integration over Dirac operators, we give an overview of multitrace and multimatrix random matrix models built from spectral triples and analyze them in the large $N$ limit using positivity constraints on Hankel moment matrices. In this setting, the bootstrap philosophy, originating in the S-matrix program and revived in modern conformal bootstrap theory, reappears as a rigorous analytic tool for extracting spectral data from consistency alone, without solving the model explicitly. We explain how Schwinger-Dyson equations, factorization at large $N$, and the noncommutative moment problem lead to finite-dimensional semidefinite programs whose feasible regions encode the allowed pairs of coupling constants and moments. Connections with spectral geometry, in particular the study of Laplace eigenvalues, are also discussed, illustrating how bootstrapping provides a unified mechanism for deriving bounds in both commutative and noncommutative settings."

    "abstract": "The linear and non-linear dynamics of centrifugal instability in Taylor-Couette flow are investigated when fluids are stably stratified and highly diffusive. One-dimensional local linear stability analysis (LSA) on cylindrical Couette flow confirms that the stabilising role of stratification on centrifugal instability is suppressed by strong thermal diffusion (i.e. low Prandtl number $Pr$). For $Pr\\ll1$, it is verified that the instability dependence on thermal diffusion and stratification with the non-dimensional Brunt-Väisälä frequency $N$ can be prescribed by a single rescaled parameter $P_{N}=N^{2}Pr$. From direct numerical simulation (DNS), various non-linear features such as axisymmetric Taylor vortices at saturation, secondary instability leading to non-axisymmetric patterns or transition to chaotic states are investigated for various values of $Pr\\leq1$ and the Reynolds number $Re_{i}$. Two-dimensional bi-global LSA on axisymmetric Taylor vortices, which appear as primary centrifugal instability saturates nonlinearly, is also performed to find the secondary critical Reynolds number $Re_{i,2}$ at which the Taylor vortices become unstable by non-axisymmetric perturbation. The bi-global LSA reveals that $Re_{i,2}$ increases (i.e. the onset of secondary instability is delayed) in the range $10^{-3}<Pr<1$ at $N=1$ or as $N$ increases at $Pr=0.01$. Secondary instability leading to highly non-axisymmetric or irregular chaotic patterns is further investigated by the 3D DNS. The Nusselt number $Nu$ is also computed from the torque at the inner cylinder for various $Pr$ and $Re_{i}$ at $N=1$ to describe how the angular momentum transfer increases with $Re_{i}$ and how $Nu$ varies differently for saturated and chaotic states."

In this work, we present a framework for spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single driven optical cavity containing a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. We demonstrate that the cavity transmission power spectral density provides a direct and measurable proxy for a momentum- and frequency-resolved photonic Chern marker, enabling topological characteristics to be inferred from spectral data without the need for bulk-band tomography. In the loss-dominated regime, where cavity decay exceeds atomic dissipation, the power spectral density exhibits Dirac-like gapped hybrid modes with a vanishing Chern marker, indicating a trivial phase. When the dissipation imbalance is reversed, a bright, gap-spanning spectral ridge emerges, co-localized with peaks in both the Chern marker and Berry curvature. The complex spectrum reveals parity-time symmetric coalescences and gain-loss bifurcations, marking exceptional points and enabling chiral, gap-traversing transport. By linking noise spectroscopy to geometric and non-Hermitian topology in a minimal cavity-QED architecture, this work provides a framework for spectroscopic detection of topological order in driven quantum systems. This approach offers a pathway to compact, tunable topological photonics across a broad range of light-matter platforms, providing a method for the study and control of topological phases in hybrid quantum systems."

Examples with $k>1$ include degree-Rips bifiltrations and models of the multicover bifiltration. We consider the problem of converting a $k$-critical bifiltration into a $1$-critical (i.e. free) chain complex with equivalent homology. This is known as computing a free resolution of the underlying chain complex and is a first step toward post-processing such bifiltrations. We present two algorithms. The first one computes free resolutions corresponding to path graphs and assembles them to a chain complex by computing additional maps. The simple combinatorial structure of path graphs leads to good performance in practice, as demonstrated by extensive experiments. However, its worst-case bound is quadratic in the input size because long paths might yield dense boundary matrices in the output. Our second algorithm replaces the simplex-wise path graphs with ones that maintain short paths which leads to almost linear runtime and output size. We demonstrate that pre-computing a free resolution speeds up the task of computing a minimal presentation of the homology of a $k$-critical bifiltration in a fixed dimension. Furthermore, our findings show that a chain complex that is minimal in terms of generators can be asymptotically larger than the non-minimal output complex of our second algorithm in terms of description size."

Furthermore, their non-human-like workflows make them difficult for human observers to interpret. To address this, we introduce the Chain-of-Image Generation (CoIG) framework, which reframes image generation as a sequential, semantic process analogous to how humans create art. Similar to the advantages in monitorability and performance that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) brought to large language models (LLMs), CoIG can produce equivalent benefits in text-to-image generation. CoIG utilizes an LLM to decompose a complex prompt into a sequence of simple, step-by-step instructions. The image generation model then executes this plan by progressively generating and editing the image. Each step focuses on a single semantic entity, enabling direct monitoring. We formally assess this property using two novel metrics: CoIG Readability, which evaluates the clarity of each intermediate step via its corresponding output; and Causal Relevance, which quantifies the impact of each procedural step on the final generated image. We further show that our framework mitigates entity collapse by decomposing the complex generation task into simple subproblems, analogous to the procedural reasoning employed by CoT. Our experimental results indicate that CoIG substantially enhances quantitative monitorability while achieving competitive compositional robustness compared to established baseline models. The framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated with any image generation model."

For more general, smooth potentials, we identify and exploit a natural small parameter: the density matrix becomes strongly quasidiagonal in the coordinate representation, with its off-diagonal width shrinking as the bath's spectral cutoff increases, providing a controlled parameter for accurate approximation. The framework is fully general: arbitrary initial quantum states-including highly non-classical superpositions-are incorporated via their Wigner functions, which serve as statistical weights for trajectory ensembles. Furthermore, the formalism naturally accommodates external manipulations and measurements modeled by preparation functions acting at arbitrary times, enabling the simulation of complex driven-dissipative quantum protocols."

Several methods have tried to bridge this gap via a post-hoc approach or self-interpretable design. Most of them focus on graph structure analysis to determine essential patterns that correlate with prediction outcomes. While post-hoc explanation methods are adaptable, they require extra computational resources and may be less reliable due to limited access to the model's internal workings. Conversely, Interpretable models can provide immediate explanations, but their generalizability to different scenarios remains a major concern.

In the proposed system, UAV agents act as distributed actors coordinated by a shared critic operating with multi head attention mechanism at a low Earth orbit satellite. Experimental results then demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods by up to 33% in cumulative reward while achieving superior energy efficiency and fairness."

    "abstract": "Modern computing architectures feature low-precision matrix multiplication units that achieve substantially higher throughput than their high-precision counterparts. Motivated by this architectural trend, the emulation of high-precision matrix multiplication using low-precision hardware has attracted significant interest in the high-performance computing community. Ozaki, Uchino, and Imamura introduced the Ozaki-II scheme as a general framework for emulating matrix multiplication. Building on this framework, Uchino, Ozaki, and Imamura developed high-performance and power-efficient techniques for emulating single- and double-precision real matrix multiplication on INT8 matrix engines. Extending this line of research, the present study proposes high-performance emulation methods for single- and double-precision complex matrix multiplication on INT8 matrix engines, based on the Ozaki-II scheme. On an NVIDIA B200 GPU, the proposed methods achieve 4.0x--5.6x and 4.4x--6.5x speedups over the native single- and double-precision complex matrix multiplication routines from cuBLAS, respectively, for sufficiently large problem sizes. When lower accuracy than that of the standard routine is acceptable, the proposed methods can operate at even higher speed. Conversely, with only a modest increase in computation time, they can also deliver higher accuracy than the standard routines. These properties suggest that the proposed approach has the potential to serve as a default algorithm across a wide range of applications."

    "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are used extensively in critical infrastructure, underscoring the need for anomaly detection systems that are able to catch even the most motivated attackers. Traditional anomaly detection techniques typically do `one-off' training on datasets crafted by experts or generated by fuzzers, potentially limiting their ability to generalize to unseen and more subtle attack strategies. Stopping at this point misses a key opportunity: a defender can actively challenge the attacker to find more nuanced attacks, which in turn can lead to more effective detection capabilities. Building on this concept, we propose Evo-Defender, an evolutionary framework that iteratively strengthens CPS defenses through a dynamic attacker-defender interaction. Evo-Defender includes a smart attacker that employs guided fuzzing to explore diverse, non-redundant attack strategies, while the self-evolving defender uses incremental learning to adapt to new attack patterns. We implement Evo-Defender on two realistic CPS testbeds: the Tennessee Eastman process and a Robotic Arm Assembly Workstation, injecting over 600 attack scenarios. In end-to-end attack detection experiments, Evo-Defender achieves up to 2.7% higher performance than state-of-the-art baselines on unseen scenarios, while utilizing training data more efficiently for faster and more robust detection."

At its core is InfiniteDiffusion, a novel algorithm for infinite generation, enabling seamless, real-time synthesis of boundless landscapes. A hierarchical stack of diffusion models couples planetary context with local detail, while a compact Laplacian encoding stabilizes outputs across Earth-scale dynamic ranges. An open-source infinite-tensor framework supports constant-memory manipulation of unbounded tensors, and few-step consistency distillation enables efficient generation. Together, these components establish diffusion models as a practical foundation for procedural world generation, capable of synthesizing entire planets coherently, controllably, and without limits."

In this paper, we employed mean field approximation theory to study the semiclassical dynamics in the Rabi-Stark model (RSM) and showed that the nonlinear Stark coupling significantly modulates the semiclassical phase space structure. By analyzing the linear entanglement entropy of coherent states prepared in the classical chaotic and regular regions of the semiclassical phase space, we demonstrate that quantum-classical correspondence can be achieved in the RSM with large atom-light frequency ratios. While this correspondence fails in the resonant Rabi model because its truncated photon number is insufficient to approach the large quantum number limit, we discovered that in the resonant RSM when the nonlinear Stark coupling $U \\to \\pm 1$, the time-averaged linear entanglement entropy correlates strongly with the semiclassical phase space. In particular, when $U \\to -1$, the truncated photon number in the resonant RSM is very close to that in the resonant Rabi model, but the time-averaged linear entanglement entropy still corresponds well with the semiclassical phase space. This result demonstrates that quantum-classical correspondence can be realized in the few-body resonant RSM."

Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel reinforced strategy injection mechanism (rSIM), that enables any LLM to become an RLM by employing a small planner to guide the LLM's CoT through the adaptive injection of reasoning strategies. To achieve this, the planner (leader agent) is jointly trained with an LLM (follower agent) using multi-agent RL (MARL), based on a leader-follower framework and straightforward rule-based rewards. Experimental results show that rSIM enables Qwen2.5-0.5B to become an RLM and significantly outperform Qwen2.5-14B. Moreover, the planner is generalizable: it only needs to be trained once and can be applied as a plug-in to substantially improve the reasoning capabilities of existing LLMs. In addition, the planner supports continual learning across various tasks, allowing its planning abilities to gradually improve and generalize to a wider range of problems."

This paper addresses a key challenge in the initial deployment phase of CAVs: the limited benefits of cooperative platooning due to the sparse distribution of CAVs on the road. To overcome this limitation, we propose an innovative control framework that enhances cooperative platooning in mixed traffic environments. Two techniques are utilized: (1) a mixed cooperative platooning strategy that integrates CACC with unconnected vehicles (CACCu), and (2) a strategic lane-change decision model designed to facilitate safe and efficient lane changes for platoon formation. Additionally, a surrounding vehicle identification system is embedded in the framework to enable CAVs to effectively identify and select potential platooning leaders. Simulation studies across various CV market penetration rates (MPRs) show that incorporating CACCu systems significantly improves safety, comfort, and traffic efficiency compared to existing systems with only CACC and ACC systems, even at CV penetration as low as 10%. The maximized platoon formation increases by up to 24%, accompanied by an 11% reduction in acceleration and a 7% decrease in fuel consumption. Furthermore, the strategic lane-change model enhances CAV performance, achieving notable improvements between 6% and 60% CV penetration, without adversely affecting overall traffic flow."

We propose Model Predictive Diffuser (MPDiffuser), a compositional model-based diffusion framework consisting of: (i) a planner that generates diverse, task-aligned trajectories; (ii) a dynamics model that enforces consistency with the underlying system dynamics; and (iii) a ranker module that selects behaviors aligned with the task objectives. MPDiffuser employs an alternating diffusion sampling scheme, where planner and dynamics updates are interleaved to progressively refine trajectories for both task alignment and feasibility during the sampling process. We also provide a theoretical rationale for this procedure, showing how it balances fidelity to data priors with dynamics consistency. Empirically, the compositional design improves sample efficiency, as it leverages even low-quality data for dynamics learning and adapts seamlessly to novel dynamics. We evaluate MPDiffuser on both unconstrained (D4RL) and constrained (DSRL) offline decision-making benchmarks, demonstrating consistent gains over existing approaches. Furthermore, we present a preliminary study extending MPDiffuser to vision-based control tasks, showing its potential to scale to high-dimensional sensory inputs. Finally, we deploy our method on a real quadrupedal robot, showcasing its practicality for real-world control."

This task requires faithfully preserving visible content while synthesizing unseen regions in a geometrically consistent manner. To achieve this, we present EgoX, a novel framework for generating egocentric videos from a single exocentric input. EgoX leverages the pretrained spatio temporal knowledge of large-scale video diffusion models through lightweight LoRA adaptation and introduces a unified conditioning strategy that combines exocentric and egocentric priors via width and channel wise concatenation. Additionally, a geometry-guided self-attention mechanism selectively attends to spatially relevant regions, ensuring geometric coherence and high visual fidelity. Our approach achieves coherent and realistic egocentric video generation while demonstrating strong scalability and robustness across unseen and in-the-wild videos."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance in code generation and understanding tasks, yet their high computational costs hinder broader adoption. One important factor is the inherent verbosity of programming languages, such as unnecessary formatting elements and lengthy boilerplate code. This leads to inflated token counts in both input and generated outputs, which increases inference costs and slows down the generation process. Prior work improves this through simplifying programming language grammar, reducing token usage across both code understanding and generation tasks. However, it is confined to syntactic transformations, leaving significant opportunities for token reduction unrealized at the semantic level. In this work, we propose Token Sugar, a concept that replaces frequent and verbose code patterns with reversible, token-efficient shorthand in the source code. To realize this concept in practice, we designed a systematic solution that mines high-frequency, token-heavy patterns from a code corpus, maps each to a unique shorthand, and integrates them into LLM pretraining via code transformation. With this solution, we obtain 799 (code pattern, shorthand) pairs, which can reduce up to 15.1% token count in the source code and is complementary to existing syntax-focused methods. We further trained three widely used LLMs on Token Sugar-augmented data. Experimental results show that these models not only achieve significant token savings (up to 11.2% reduction) during generation but also maintain near-identical Pass@1 scores compared to baselines trained on unprocessed code."

This work analyzes how location leakage arises from gradients in a virtual-environment radio map model and proposes a geometry-aligned differential privacy mechanism with heterogeneous noise tailored to both confuse localization and cover gradient spatial patterns. The approach is theoretically supported with a convergence guarantee linking privacy strength to learning accuracy. Numerical experiments show the approach increases attacker localization error from 30 m to over 180 m, with only 0.2 dB increase in radio map construction error compared to a uniform-noise baseline."

Rather than perturbing the entire sample, we add noise to exceedances above a high threshold and apply the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) approximation. Confidence intervals are derived by simulating the distribution of pivotal statistics from the perturbed data. We show that the pivotal statistic is consistent, ensuring the proposed method provides consistent intervals for the EVI. Additionally, we demonstrate that the perturbed data is differentially private. When the GPD approximation is inadequate, we introduce a refined perturbation method.

Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have demonstrated substantial potential in solving differential equations, and their quantum counterparts, quantum-PINNs, exhibit enhanced representational capacity with fewer trainable parameters. However, both approaches face notable challenges in accurately solving multiscale features. Furthermore, their reliance on automatic differentiation for constructing loss functions introduces considerable computational overhead, resulting in longer training times. To overcome these challenges, we developed a wavelet-accelerated physics-informed quantum neural network that eliminates the need for automatic differentiation, significantly reducing computational complexity. The proposed framework incorporates the multiresolution property of wavelets within the quantum neural network architecture, thereby enhancing the network's ability to effectively capture both local and global features of multiscale problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior accuracy while requiring less than five percent of the trainable parameters compared to classical wavelet-based PINNs, resulting in faster convergence. Moreover, it offers a speedup of three to five times compared to existing quantum PINNs, highlighting the potential of the proposed approach for efficiently solving challenging multiscale and oscillatory problems."

Existing methods typically rely on a single prior, which is inherently insufficient to handle multiple degradations, or employ complex network architectures trained on synthetic data, which suffer from poor generalization for diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose Spatial and Frequency Priors (SFP) for real-world scene recovery. In the spatial domain, we observe that the inverse of the degraded image exhibits a projection along its spectral direction that resembles the scene transmission. Leveraging this spatial prior, the transmission map is estimated to recover the scene from scattering degradation. In the frequency domain, a mask is constructed for adaptive frequency enhancement, with two parameters estimated using our proposed novel priors. Specifically, one prior assumes that the mean intensity of the degraded image's direct current (DC) components across three channels in the frequency domain closely approximates that of each channel in the clear image. The second prior is based on the observation that, for clear images, the magnitude of low radial frequencies below 0.001 constitutes approximately 1% of the total spectrum. Finally, we design a weighted fusion strategy to integrate spatial-domain restoration, frequency-domain enhancement, and salient features from the input image, yielding the final recovered result. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed SFP for scene recovery under various degradation conditions."

Therefore, transiting brown dwarfs are a testbed for the interior and evolutionary models of brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets.

We show that intense stellar irradiation can cause a large enhancement in the radius of transiting brown dwarfs at all masses, especially if the incident flux exceeds $log_{10}(F/cgs)\\ge$9 ($T_{\\rm eq}\\ge 1450$ K). Stellar irradiation can significantly alter rates of nuclear burning in irradiated brown dwarfs, making the Deuterium-burning and Hydrogen-burning minimum masses strong functions of incident stellar flux. We show that the D-burning and H-burning minimum masses can decrease by 16% and 13%, respectively, between isolated and strongly irradiated brown dwarfs ( $log_{10}(F/cgs)\\ge$10 ($T_{\\rm eq}\\ge 2570$ K)). This shows that stellar irradiation has a larger impact on the planet-brown dwarf-star mass boundaries than metallicity or clouds. We show that metal cores or migration affect their evolution to a much lesser extent, whereas low mass highly irradiated old sources can help us test the physics of hot Jupiter radius anomaly. We fit the observed radii of 46 transiting brown dwarfs and show that our irradiated evolutionary models fit their radii better than models that ignore the host star, especially for highly irradiated objects. However, the measured radii of 10 objects are still inconsistent at $>3σ$ level, indicating residual gaps in our irradiated evolutionary model."

The constraints governing the STT are first formulated as loss functions of the PINN, and a training algorithm is proposed to minimize the overall violation. The PINN being trained on certain collocation points, we propose a Lipschitz-based validity condition to formally verify that the learned PINN satisfies the conditions over the continuous time horizon.

    "abstract": "Bacteriophage-bacteria interactions are central to microbial ecology, influencing evolution, biogeochemical cycles, and pathogen behavior. Most theoretical models assume static environments and passive bacterial hosts, neglecting the joint effects of bacterial traits and environmental fluctuations on coexistence dynamics. This limitation hinders the prediction of microbial persistence in dynamic ecosystems such as soils and oceans.Using a minimal ordinary differential equation framework, we show that the bacterial growth rate and the phage adsorption rate collectively determine three possible ecological outcomes: phage extinction, stable coexistence, or oscillation-induced extinction. Specifically, we demonstrate that environmental fluctuations can suppress destructive oscillations through resonance, promoting coexistence where static models otherwise predict collapse. Counterintuitively, we find that lower bacterial growth rates are helpful in enhancing survival under high infection pressure, elucidating the observed post-infection growth reduction.Our studies reframe bacterial hosts as active builders of ecological dynamics and environmental variation as a potential stabilizing force. Our findings thus bridge a key theory-experiment gap and provide a foundational framework for predicting microbial responses to environmental stress, which might have potential implications for phage therapy, microbiome management, and climate-impacted community resilience."

    "abstract": "Decoupled weight decay, solely responsible for the performance advantage of AdamW over Adam, has long been set to proportional to learning rate $γ$ without questioning. Some researchers have recently challenged such assumption and argued that decoupled weight decay should be set $\\propto γ^2$ instead based on orthogonality arguments at steady state. To the contrary, we find that eliminating the contribution of the perpendicular component of the update to the weight norm leads to little change to the training dynamics. Instead, we derive that decoupled weight decay $\\propto γ^2$ results in stable weight norm based on the simple assumption that updates become independent of the weights at steady state, regardless of the nature of the optimizer. Based on the same assumption, we derive and empirically verify that the Total Update Contribution (TUC) of a minibatch under the Scion optimizer is better characterized by the momentum-dependent effective learning rate whose optimal value transfers and we show that decoupled weight decay $\\propto γ^2$ leads to stable weight and gradient norms and allows us to better control the training dynamics and improve the model performance."

Yet, restoring a network's formation from a single static snapshot remains challenging. Here, we present a transferable machine learning framework that infers network evolutionary trajectories solely from present topology. By integrating graph neural networks with transformers, our approach unlocks a latent temporal dimension directly from the static topology. Evaluated across diverse domains, the framework achieves high transfer accuracy of up to 95.3%, demonstrating its robustness and transferability. Applied to the Drosophila brain connectome, it restores the formation times of over 2.6 million neural connections, revealing that early-forming links support essential behaviors such as mating and foraging, whereas later-forming connections underpin complex sensory and social functions. These results demonstrate that a substantial fraction of evolutionary information is encoded within static network architecture, offering a powerful, general tool for elucidating the hidden temporal dynamics of complex systems."

In this work, we propose a new type of boundary condition based on the method of asymptotic partial decomposition of a domain (MAPDD), which we denote as the Duct Boundary Condition (DuBC). This approach enables the incorporation of geometrically reduced domains as a boundary term with only local coupling in the implicit case. Moreover, the DuBC accounts for both viscous and inertial effects simultaneously using a single physical parameter. Additionally, we derive a fractional-step time-marching scheme including the DuBC. We demonstrate the features of the DuBC in coronary artery blood flow simulations, including sequential parameter estimation from noisy velocity data."

In this article, by means of primal-dual optimization tools, we study the partially model-free design of the mean-field stochastic LQR (MF-SLQR) controller using a policy learning approach. Firstly, by designing appropriate optimizing variables, the considered MF-SLQR problem is transformed into a new static nonconvex constrained optimization problem with equivalence preserved in certain senses. After that, the equivalent formulation of the duality results is constructed via finding the solution of the generalized Lyapunov equation. Then, the strong duality is analyzed, based on which we establish a primal-dual algorithm by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. More importantly, a partially model-free implementation is also presented, which has a direct connection with the classical policy iteration algorithm. Finally, we use a high-dimensional example to validate our methods."

    "abstract": "Real-time speech communication over wireless networks remains challenging, as conventional channel protection mechanisms cannot effectively counter packet loss under stringent bandwidth and latency constraints. Semantic communication has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the robustness of speech transmission by means of joint source-channel coding (JSCC). However, its cross-layer design hinders practical deployment due to the incompatibility with existing digital communication systems. In this case, the robustness of speech communication is consequently evaluated primarily by the error-resilience to packet loss over wireless networks. To address these challenges, we propose \\emph{Glaris}, a generative latent-prior-based resilient speech semantic communication framework that performs resilient speech coding in the generative latent space. Generative latent priors enable high-quality packet loss concealment (PLC) at the receiver side, well-balancing semantic consistency and reconstruction fidelity. Additionally, an integrated error resilience mechanism is designed to mitigate the error propagation and improve the effectiveness of PLC. Compared with traditional packet-level forward error correction (FEC) strategies, our new method achieves enhanced robustness over dynamic wireless networks while reducing redundancy overhead significantly. Experimental results on the LibriSpeech dataset demonstrate that \\emph{Glaris} consistently outperforms existing error-resilient codecs, achieving JSCC-level robustness while maintaining seamless compatibility with existing systems, and it also strikes a favorable balance between transmission efficiency and speech reconstruction quality."

Coherent pulsations are detected at $P_{\\rm spin}=5.49\\pm0.05$ h, which is one of the longest spin periods known among XRPs. While the phase-averaged analysis shows no significant polarization, with a 99% confidence minimum detectable polarization (MDP$_{99}$) of 5.0% in the 2-8 keV band, the phase-resolved analysis shows one interval at pulse maximum in which the polarization degree (PD) exceeds its MDP$_{99}$, giving ${\\rm PD}=10.3\\pm3.1$%. The polarization angle (PA) exhibits a smooth $\\approx140^{\\circ}$ rotation over the pulse, and a joint evaluation of all phase bins yields an overall detection significance of $3.3σ$. Using the rotating vector model, we identify the geometric solution that reproduces the observed PA variation.

We find that if the aether field is timelike, there is no static black hole solution existing, which is different from the result reported in Phys. Rev. D {\\bf64} 024028.

The Smarr formula and the first law can be still constructed via the extended method of Killing potential. For the linearized M-subset Einstein-aether theory with the timelike aether field, we find the speed of spin-2 modes is unit, which aren't dependent on spacetime dimensions $D$ and aether constant $b_1$, but some parts of polarizations are disappeared. The speed of spin-1 modes is unit also. The third kind mode is the longitudinal aether-metric mode, which is linearly time dependent and not the spin-0 mode."

Using a cumulant expansion approach, the computational complexity scales polynomially as opposed to exponentially with the number of emitters, enabling Monte Carlo sampling over a large number of realizations. The framework is applied to model negatively charged silicon-vacancy (SiV$^{-}$) centers inside diamond. Incorporating spatial disorder and inhomogeneous broadening, we obtain statistically averaged responses over hundreds of SiV$^{-}$ clusters. These simulations reveal two signatures of collective behavior. First, dynamics of fully inverted clusters show that superradiant emission occurs only with sufficiently large emitter number and high quantum efficiency. Unlike ideal Dicke superradiance, the burst is substantially suppressed by strong near-field dipole-dipole interaction, consistent with existing theoretical predictions. Second, under continuous-wave excitation we compute photoluminescence-excitation spectra, which exhibit interaction-induced broadening in the distribution of resonance peaks. The corresponding density of states also displays a non-zero skewness. Overall, by incorporating realistic inhomogeneities in emitter clusters, our framework is able to predict statistics for disordered ensembles that can be compared to experiments directly. Our approach generalizes to other types of emitters, including atoms, molecules, and quantum dots, thus providing a practical tool for analyzing collective behavior in realistic quantum systems."

The proportional hazards mixture cure model is especially advantageous when the presence of a cured fraction can be reasonably assumed, providing a more accurate representation of long-term survival dynamics. In this study, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for the semiparametric mixture cure model, which accommodates both the inclusion and exclusion of a frailty component, allowing for greater flexibility in capturing unobserved heterogeneity among patients. Samples from the posterior distribution are obtained using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, leveraging a hierarchical structure inspired by Bayesian Lasso. Comprehensive simulation studies are conducted across diverse scenarios to evaluate the performance and robustness of the proposed models. Bayesian model comparison and assessment are performed using various criteria. Finally, the proposed approaches are applied to two well-known datasets in the cure model literature: the E1690 melanoma trial and a colon cancer clinical trial."

    "abstract": "In our prior work, LayerPipe, we had introduced an approach to accelerate training of convolutional, fully connected, and spiking neural networks by overlapping forward and backward computation. However, despite empirical success, a principled understanding of how much gradient delay needs to be introduced at each layer to achieve desired level of pipelining was not addressed. This paper, LayerPipe2, fills that gap by formally deriving LayerPipe using variable delayed gradient adaptation and retiming. We identify where delays may be legally inserted and show that the required amount of delay follows directly from the network structure where inner layers require fewer delays and outer layers require longer delays. When pipelining is applied at every layer, the amount of delay depends only on the number of remaining downstream stages. When layers are pipelined in groups, all layers in the group share the same assignment of delays. These insights not only explain previously observed scheduling patterns but also expose an often overlooked challenge that pipelining implicitly requires storage of historical weights. We overcome this storage bottleneck by developing a pipeline--aware moving average that reconstructs the required past states rather than storing them explicitly. This reduces memory cost without sacrificing the accuracy guarantees that makes pipelined learning viable. The result is a principled framework that illustrates how to construct LayerPipe architectures, predicts their delay requirements, and mitigates their storage burden, thereby enabling scalable pipelined training with controlled communication computation tradeoffs."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the performance of the adaptive matched filtering (AMF) in cluttered environments, particularly when operating with superimposed signals. Since the instantaneous signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) is a random variable dependent on the data payload, using it directly as a design objective poses severe practical challenges, such as prohibitive computational burdens and signaling overhead. To address this, we propose shifting the optimization objective from an instantaneous to a statistical metric, which focuses on maximizing the average SCNR over all possible payloads. Due to its analytical intractability, we leverage tools from random matrix theory (RMT) to derive an asymptotic approximation for the average SCNR, which remains accurate even in moderate-dimensional regimes. A key finding from our theoretical analysis is that, for a fixed modulation basis, the PSK achieves a superior average SCNR compared to QAM and the pure Gaussian constellation. Furthermore, for any given constellation, the OFDM achieves a higher average SCNR than SC and AFDM. Then, we propose two pilot design schemes to enhance system performance: a Data-Payload-Dependent (DPD) scheme and a Data-Payload-Independent (DPI) scheme. The DPD approach maximizes the instantaneous SCNR for each transmission. Conversely, the DPI scheme optimizes the average SCNR, offering a flexible trade-off between sensing performance and implementation complexity. Then, we develop two dedicated optimization algorithms for DPD and DPI schemes. In particular, for the DPD problem, we employ fractional optimization and the KKT conditions to derive a closed-form solution. For the DPI problem, we adopt a manifold optimization approach to handle the inherent rank-one constraint efficiently. Simulation results validate the accuracy of our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods."

This shift focuses on enabling more personalized task planning and design, thereby achieving a higher quality of interaction experience and greater flexibility, which can be used in many fileds, such as agriculture, aerial photography, logistics, and environmental monitoring. However, due to the lack of a common language between users and the UAVs, such interactions are often difficult to be achieved. The developments of Large Language Models possess the ability to understand nature languages and Robots' (UAVs') behaviors, marking the possibility of personalized Human-UAV Interaction. Recently, some HUI frameworks based on LLMs have been proposed, but they commonly suffer from difficulties in mixed task planning and execution, leading to low adaptability in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-agent HUI framework. This framework constructs two independent LLM agents (a task planning agent, and an execution agent) and applies different Prompt Engineering to separately handle the understanding, planning, and execution of tasks. To verify the effectiveness and performance of the framework, we have built a task database covering four typical application scenarios of UAVs and quantified the performance of the HUI framework using three independent metrics. Meanwhile different LLM models are selected to control the UAVs with compared performance. Our user study experimental results demonstrate that the framework improves the smoothness of HUI and the flexibility of task execution in the tasks scenario we set up, effectively meeting users' personalized needs."

This raises the question \"Can't we efficiently manipulate the existing generative capabilities of a flow model?\" To this end, we introduce FlowSteer (FS), an operator-aware conditioning scheme that injects measurement priors along the sampling path,coupling a frozed flow's implicit guidance with explicit measurement constraints.

Common open-source simulators like CARLA are extensively used in training, evaluation, and software-in-the-loop testing of new automated driving algorithms. However, the CARLA simulator lacks an evaluation where research and automated driving vehicles are simulated with their entire sensor and actuation stack in real time. The goal of this work is therefore to create a simulation framework for testing the automation software on its dedicated hardware and identifying its limits. Achieving this goal would greatly benefit the open-source development workflow of automated driving functions, designating CARLA as a consistent evaluation tool along the entire development process. To achieve this goal, in a first step, requirements are derived, and a simulation architecture is specified and implemented. Based on the formulated requirements, the proposed vEDGAR software is evaluated, resulting in a final conclusion on the applicability of CARLA for HiL testing of automated vehicles.

This is immediately followed by the overgrowth of CsPbBr3, delivering AgBr@CsPbBr3 nanocubes of several tens of nanometers in size, with the volume of the AgBr core being only a small fraction of the overall nanocrystal volume. The formation of a core@shell geometry is facilitated by the epitaxial compatibility between AgBr and CsPbBr3 along multiple crystallographic directions. Exchange with Cl-ions leads to Ag@CsPbCl3 nanocubes, whereas exchange with I-ions leads to hollow CsPbI3 nanocubes, due to selective etching of the AgBr (or Ag) core region by the I-ions diffusing in the nanocubes. These hollow CsPbI3 nanocubes can then be converted into hollow CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3 nanocubes by halide exchange. The optical emission properties of the hollow CsPbX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) nanocubes are in line with those expected from large, non-hollow halide perovskite nanocrystals, indicating that the small hollow region in the cubes has no major influence on their optical properties."

While certified unlearning has been analyzed in centralized and server-orchestrated federated settings (via guarantees analogous to differential privacy, DP), the decentralized setting -- where peers communicate without a coordinator remains underexplored. We study certified unlearning in decentralized networks with fixed topologies and propose RR-DU, a random-walk procedure that performs one projected gradient ascent step on the forget set at the unlearning client and a geometrically distributed number of projected descent steps on the retained data elsewhere, combined with subsampled Gaussian noise and projection onto a trust region around the original model. We provide (i) convergence guarantees in the convex case and stationarity guarantees in the nonconvex case, (ii) $(\\varepsilon,δ)$ network-unlearning certificates on client views via subsampled Gaussian Rényi DP (RDP) with segment-level subsampling, and (iii) deletion-capacity bounds that scale with the forget-to-local data ratio and quantify the effect of decentralization (network mixing and randomized subsampling) on the privacy-utility trade-off. Empirically, on image benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10), RR-DU matches a given $(\\varepsilon,δ)$ while achieving higher test accuracy than decentralized DP baselines and reducing forget accuracy to random guessing ($\\approx 10\\%$)."

    "abstract": "Datasets often exhibit violations of expected monotonic trends - for example, higher education level correlating with higher average salary, newer homes being more expensive, or diabetes prevalence increasing with age. We address the problem of quantifying how far a dataset deviates from such trends. To this end, we introduce Aggregate Order Dependencies (AODs), an aggregation-centric extension of the previously studied order dependencies. An AOD specifies that the aggregated value of a target attribute (e.g., mean salary) should monotonically increase or decrease with the grouping attribute (e.g., education level). We formulate the AOD repair problem as finding the smallest set of tuples to delete from a table so that the given AOD is satisfied. We analyze the computational complexity of this problem and propose a general algorithmic template for solving it. We instantiate the template for common aggregation functions, introduce optimization techniques that substantially improve the runtime of the template instances, and develop efficient heuristic alternatives. Our experimental study, carried out on both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrates the practical efficiency of the algorithms and provides insight into the performance of the heuristics. We also present case studies that uncover and explain unexpected AOD violations using our framework."

However, these frameworks do not account for categorical labels, which are intrinsic to many real-world datasets, such as labeled images, pre-clustered data, and semantically segmented shapes. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for labeled metric spaces and develop new notions of Gromov-Hausdorff distance and persistent homology which are adapted to this setting. Our main result shows that our persistent homology construction is stable with respect to our novel notion of Gromov-Hausdorff distance, extending a classic result in topological data analysis. To facilitate computation, we also introduce a labeled version of persistence landscapes and show that the landscape map is Lipschitz."

We first express the EYM integrand by tree-level amplitudes according to the forward limit approach. Employing a two-step expansion strategy, the gluon-loop EYM integrand is decomposed into tree-level YM amplitudes under the forward limit, which are subsequently expanded into tree-level bi-adjoint scalar (BS) ones. We then prove that when the kinematic coefficients in both expansion steps satisfy the one-loop consistency conditions, the EYM integrand is finally expanded as a combination of YM integrands with quadratic propagators. The coefficients in this expansion formula coincide exactly with those in the expansion formula for YMS integrands. This correspondence highlights a shared kinematic structure, providing the proper foundation for constructing BCJ numerators in both YMS and EYM theories at one loop."

These measurements provide invaluable information about the properties of cold, catalyzed matter beyond nuclear saturation density. Here we present the results of our modeling of NICER data on PSR J0437$-$4715 using several different models of hot thermal X-ray emitting spots on the stellar surface. For this pulsar, previous Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) observations established that there is also a modulated nonthermal component to the emission, but the previously published analysis of NICER data did not model this component. We find that the Bayesian evidence is significantly higher when the modulated nonthermal component is included, and that omission of this component leads to poor fits to the bolometric NICER data and thus risks bias in the resulting radius estimates. Our models, which we pursue to inferential convergence, therefore have modulated nonthermal emission, and our headline model has in addition three uniform-temperature thermally-emitting circular spots. Using this model, the symmetric 68% credible range in the radius is 11.8 km to 15.1 km, which at the independently-measured mass of $M=1.418\\pm 0.044~M_\\odot$ is consistent with previous reports of the radius of the $\\sim 1.4~M_\\odot$ pulsar PSR J0030$+$0451.

Consequently, there is a growing need for research on techniques that can detect inappropriate utterances within conversational texts to help build a safer communication environment. Although large-scale language models trained on Korean corpora and chain-of-thought reasoning have recently gained attention, research applying these approaches to inappropriate utterance detection remains limited. In this study, we propose a soft inductive bias approach that explicitly defines reasoning perspectives to guide the inference process, thereby promoting rational decision-making and preventing errors that may arise during reasoning. We fine-tune a Korean large language model using the proposed method and conduct both quantitative performance comparisons and qualitative evaluations across different training strategies. Experimental results show that the Kanana-1.5 model achieves an average accuracy of 87.0046, improving by approximately 3.89 percent over standard supervised learning. These findings indicate that the proposed method goes beyond simple knowledge imitation by large language models and enables more precise and consistent judgments through constrained reasoning perspectives, demonstrating its effectiveness for inappropriate utterance detection."

Here, we demonstrate that chiral surface acoustic waves (SAWs) generate sizable orbital currents in light-metal/ferromagnet bilayers through both the acoustic orbital Hall effect and acoustic orbital pumping. Using symmetry analysis of SAW-driven voltages, we disentangle vorticity-sensitive orbital currents arising from lattice rotation in the non-magnetic layer from angular-momentum pumping from the ferromagnet. Strong signals are observed only in nickel/chromium and nickel/titanium, while nickel/aluminum and all cobalt-based bilayers show negligible responses, revealing the critical roles of orbital Hall conductivity, phonon-orbital coupling, and interfacial orbital transparency. Comparison with spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance and second-harmonic measurements -- where electrically driven orbital angular momentum are weaker -- demonstrates that phonon excitation generates orbital currents more efficiently. These results establish chiral SAWs as an effective route for orbitronic functionality and open pathways toward phonon-controlled orbital magnetism."

We find that for a fixed token-to-parameter ratio, a simple power law can accurately describe the scaling behavior of log accuracy on multiple popular downstream tasks. Our results show that the direct approach extrapolates better than the previously proposed two-stage procedure, which is prone to compounding errors. Furthermore, we introduce functional forms that predict accuracy across token-to-parameter ratios and account for inference compute under repeated sampling. We validate our findings on models with up to 17B parameters trained on up to 350B tokens across two dataset mixtures. To support reproducibility and encourage future research, we release the complete set of pretraining losses and downstream evaluation results."

This technical report applies a quantitative risk modeling methodology (described in full in a companion paper) to this domain. We develop nine detailed cyber risk models that allow analyzing AI uplift as a function of AI benchmark performance. Each model decomposes attacks into steps using the MITRE ATT&CK framework and estimates how AI affects the number of attackers, attack frequency, probability of success, and resulting harm to determine different types of uplift. To produce these estimates with associated uncertainty, we employ both human experts, via a Delphi study, as well as LLM-based simulated experts, both mapping benchmark scores (from Cybench and BountyBench) to risk model factors. Individual estimates are aggregated through Monte Carlo simulation. The results indicate systematic uplift in attack efficacy, speed, and target reach, with different mechanisms of uplift across risk models. We aim for our quantitative risk modeling to fulfill several aims: to help cybersecurity teams prioritize mitigations, AI evaluators design benchmarks, AI developers make more informed deployment decisions, and policymakers obtain information to set risk thresholds. Similar goals drove the shift from qualitative to quantitative assessment over time in other high-risk industries, such as nuclear power. We propose this methodology and initial application attempt as a step in that direction for AI risk management. While our estimates carry significant uncertainty, publishing detailed quantified results can enable experts to pinpoint exactly where they disagree. This helps to collectively refine estimates, something that cannot be done with qualitative assessments alone."

Using the latest nuclear-recoil data from XENONnT, which show indications of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering from $^8$B solar neutrinos, we derive new strong bounds on light mediator couplings. We find that these limits are significantly more stringent when the mediator couples to DM, rather than when new physics affects only neutrino interactions. Building on these results, we recompute the expected neutrino fog and compare it with the corresponding constraints on spin-independent and spin-dependent DM-nucleon interactions. We show that the morphology of the neutrino fog can be markedly modified if either neutrinos or DM interact with nuclei through light mediators, even in light of these recent constraints."

    "abstract": "The formation of polarized signaling domains on cell membranes is a fundamental example of biological pattern formation. While such patterns resemble structures from equilibrium phase separation, they are intrinsically non-equilibrium, driven by energy-consuming enzymatic cycles that switch molecules like phosphoinositides or small GTPases between distinct states. Here, we develop a minimal model of this enzyme-driven phase ordering process. Starting from microscopic reaction kinetics, we derive a mesoscopic theory that belongs to the class of active Model A with a global constraint. This framework yields an explicit mean-field phase diagram and closed-form expressions for key observables, such as interfacial tension, domain fractions, and phase coexistence boundaries, in terms of kinetic rates. In this context, phase coexistence is controlled by non-equilibrium parameters like catalytic rates and enzymatic asymmetry, rather than equilibrium parameters such as saturation concentrations. The resulting phase-separated domains rapidly exchange material with their surroundings. Their maintenance requires a continuous power input determined by enzymatic kinetics. The predicted phenomenology is consistent with experimental observations on reconstituted systems of phosphoinositide and Rab5 membrane patterning. We further study how metastable uniform states decay via nucleation of minority-phase domains and subsequent coarsening, driven by an effective interfacial tension. Using large deviation theory, we derive the critical nucleation radius under the action of the intrinsic, multiplicative chemical noise. The analytical results are quantitatively confirmed by stochastic simulations of the process. Our work provides a theoretical framework identifying key biochemical parameters controlling active phase separation on membrane scaffolds, offering testable predictions for experiments."

However, sharing these identifiers with Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) brings significant privacy risks by enabling long-term tracking and linking of user activities across sessions. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving identifier checking method in 5G. This paper introduces a protocol for verifying device identifiers without exposing them to the network while maintaining the same functions as the 3GPP-defined Equipment Identity Register (EIR) process. The proposed solution modifies the PEPSI protocol for a Private Set Membership (PSM) setting using the BFV homomorphic encryption scheme. This lets User Equipment (UE) prove that its identifier is not on an operator's blacklist or greylist while ensuring that the MNO only learns the outcome of the verification. The protocol allows controlled deanonymization through an authorized Law Enforcement (LE) hook, striking a balance between privacy and accountability. Implementation results show that the system can perform online verification within five seconds and requires about 15 to 16 MB of communication per session. This confirms its practical use under post-quantum security standards. The findings highlight the promise of homomorphic encryption for managing identifiers while preserving privacy in 5G, laying the groundwork for scalable and compliant verification systems in future 6G networks."

For pulsars observed by more than one PTA, we employ a new \"direct combination\" method to merge their astrophysical models and data. This avoids the challenge of reconciling the different PTA timing models to obtain a single \"best\" model. A central result of our analysis is posterior probability distributions for the amplitude $A_{gw}$ and exponent $γ_{gw}$ of the putative SGWB energy-density spectrum, modeled as a power law in frequency. While these results are consistent with a nonzero SGWB amplitude $A_{gw}$, the statistical significance--assessed via a Bayesian odds ratio and through noise-marginalized false-alarm probabilities ($p$-values) for three different detection statistics--remains below the conventional $5σ$ threshold for a confident detection. We also reconstruct the inter-pulsar timing-residual correlation as a function of the angle $θ$ between the pulsar lines of sight.

For quantum entropy sources, where in addition to classical random variables we consider quantum side information, the use of extra knowledge about their structure was pioneered in a recent publication [C. Foreman and L. Masanes, Quantum 9, 1654 (2025)]. In that work, the authors provide deterministic extractors for device-independent randomness generation with memoryless devices achieving a sufficiently high CHSH score. In this work, we extend their construction to the prepare-and-measure scenario. Specifically, we prove that the considered functions are also extractors for memoryless devices in a semi-device-independent setting under an overlap assumption on the prepared quantum states. We then simulate the resulting randomness generation protocol on a novel and experimentally relevant family of behaviors, observing positive key rates already for $7\\times 10^3$ rounds."

Temporal shifting also decreases the footprint, though to a lesser extent.

Hyperbolic spaces exhibit exponential volume growth with radius, unlike the polynomial growth in Euclidean space. We find that this unique property is particularly effective for embedding hierarchical data structures using the Poincaré ball model, achieving significantly improved representation and discrimination power. Coupled with negative learning, it provides more accurate and robust classifications with fewer feature dimensions. Our extensive experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that the T-DHA method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in few-shot image recognition and domain generalization tasks."

Such cavities offer a rich playground to investigate anisotropic electron transport due to the trigonally warped Fermi surfaces. In this work, we achieve two things: First, we verify the existence of triangular modes (as predicted by classical ray tracing calculations) in the quantum solutions of closed circular BLG cavities. Then, we explore signatures of said triangular modes in transport through open BLG cavities connected to leads. We show that the triangular symmetry translates into anisotropic transport and present an optimal setup for experimental detection of the triangular modes as well as for controlled modulation of transport in preferred directions."

Our progenitors are 20 and 25 M$_{\\odot}$ solar-metallicity stars evolved from the zero-age main sequence with $\\texttt{MESA}$ and exploded in one dimension using $\\texttt{FLASH}$. We consider a range of circumstellar media (CSM) produced by stellar winds to investigate how pre-explosion mass-loss affects shock breakout. The multigroup flux-limited diffusion scheme in $\\texttt{CASTRO}$ captures the interaction between the explosion shock, its radiation precursor, and the surrounding CSM. We find that strong radiation precursors, generated by radiation leakage behind the shock, can drive fluid instabilities and move the effective photosphere outward before the shock reaches the stellar surface. The resulting breakout emissions reach peak luminosities of ${\\sim}10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ with full-width half-maximum durations of 1-3 hr, which are much dimmer and longer than those from blue supergiants. The light-curve colors gradually evolve from blue to red after the peak. The 25 M$_{\\odot}$ model with explosion energy $E \\sim 1.69\\times10^{51}$ erg produces ${\\sim}$10-30\\% higher maximum luminosity than the 20 M$_{\\odot}$ model with $E \\sim 1.09\\times10^{51}$ erg. The dense CSM further extends the breakout rise time by increasing the photon diffusion. These results provide new constraints on red supergiant atmospheres and mass-loss histories prior to core collapse."

Recent vision foundation models like VGGT take an orthogonal approach -- 3D knowledge is gained implicitly through training data and loss objectives, enabling feed-forward prediction of both camera parameters and 3D representations directly from a set of uncalibrated images. While flexible, VGGT features lack explicit multi-view geometric consistency, and we find that improving such 3D feature consistency benefits both NVS and pose estimation tasks. We introduce Selfi, a self-improving 3D reconstruction pipeline via feature alignment, transforming a VGGT backbone into a high-fidelity 3D reconstruction engine by leveraging its own outputs as pseudo-ground-truth. Specifically, we train a lightweight feature adapter using a reprojection-based consistency loss, which distills VGGT outputs into a new geometrically-aligned feature space that captures spatial proximity in 3D. This enables state-of-the-art performance in both NVS and camera pose estimation, demonstrating that feature alignment is a highly beneficial step for downstream 3D reasoning."

Their convolution structure with Volterra kernels endows the dynamics with a formal path-dependency, which suggests the failure of the Markov property. While this has previously been rigorously established only for Gaussian Volterra processes, by constructing nondegenerate admissible perturbations through Markovian lifts, we prove that also general SVEs with Hölder-continuous coefficients do not possess the Markov property for a broad class of Volterra kernels. Moreover, we show that the associated Markovian lift is, in general, necessarily infinite-dimensional. These observations reflect the intrinsic infinite-dimensionality of memory effects in SVEs and underscore the need for analytical and probabilistic tools beyond the classical Markovian framework."

Our approach employs Bayesian analysis to study this phenomenon. Hadronic matter is modeled using the relativistic mean-field (RMF) approximation, for which we have selected two parameter sets: \\(NL3^{*}ωρ\\), representing hadronic matter with nucleons only, and $EL3ωρ$ with nucleons only and $EL3ωρY$, which includes hyperons. On the other hand deconfined quark matter is modeled using the vector-MIT bag model. For our purpose, the phase transition is implemented using the Maxwell construction. Bayesian inference is performed by tuning three parameters: the bag constant (i.e. $B^{1/4}$), the vector coupling constant \\(\\left(G_{v}\\right)\\), and the Dirac sea contribution ($b_{4}$). We found that a phase transition could exist at densities below \\(2.0\\,n_{0}\\) for both the $EL3ωρ- EL3ωρY $ and $NL3^{*}ωρ$ parametrizations. As a consequence, our results also indicate that a hybrid neutron star could have a large quark core that comprises more than \\(80\\%\\) of its size."

The dependence of the quasinormal spectrum on $a$ is moderate for the fundamental modes and even weaker for the overtones, which approach one another in the complex-frequency plane as the halo parameter increases. No enhancement or rapid growth of overtone amplitudes is observed, indicating that the halo does not induce the type of strong near-horizon effects characteristic of quantum-corrected or exotic compact objects. Overall, our results show that the dark-matter halo introduces controlled and comparatively mild modifications to the ringdown spectrum while preserving its qualitative structure."

As a consequence, the correspondence between real-space and momentum-space spin arrangements is far richer than traditionally assumed. Building on the complete enumeration of SSGs, we develop a systematic, symmetry-based framework that classifies all possible spin arrangements allowed by these groups. This unified approach naturally incorporates conventional magnetic orders, altermagnetism, and p-wave magnetism as distinct symmetry classes. Crucially, our classification predicts a variety of novel magnetic phases, highlighted by the discovery of the coplanar even-wave magnet: a state that is non-collinear in real space but hosts a collinear even-wave spin polarization in k-space. Analysis of a minimal model reveals that this phase is characterized by non-quantized spin polarization and exhibits a novel mechanism for symmetry-enforced zero polarization on non-degenerate bands. Extending the framework from bulk crystals to layer SSGs appropriate for two-dimensional systems, we further predict layered counterparts and provide symmetry guidelines for designing bilayer coplanar p-wave and even-wave magnets. We further validate this finding through first-principles calculations and propose CoCrO4 as a promising candidate for its experimental realization, thereby demonstrating the completeness and predictive power of the SSG-based classification of magnetic orders."

    "abstract": "Rotation invariance is essential for precise, object-level segmentation in UAV aerial imagery, where targets can have arbitrary orientations and exhibit fine-scale details. Conventional segmentation architectures like U-Net rely on convolution operators that are not rotation-invariant, leading to degraded segmentation accuracy across varying viewpoints. Rotation invariance can be achieved by expanding the filter bank across multiple orientations; however, this will significantly increase computational cost and memory traffic. In this paper, we introduce a GPU-optimized rotation-invariant convolution framework that eliminates the traditional data-lowering (im2col) step required for matrix-multiplication-based convolution. By exploiting structured data sharing among symmetrically rotated filters, our method achieves multi-orientation convolution with greatly reduced memory traffic and computational redundancy. We further generalize the approach to accelerate convolution with arbitrary (non-symmetric) rotation angles. Across extensive benchmarks, the proposed convolution achieves 20--55% faster training and 15--45% lower energy consumption than CUDNN, while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art rotation-invariant methods. In the eight-orientation setting, our approach achieves up to 45% speedup and 41% energy savings on 256\\(\\times\\)256 inputs, and 32% speedup and 23% lower energy usage on 1024\\(\\times\\)1024 inputs. Integrated into a U-Net segmentation model, the framework yields up to 6% improvement in accuracy over the non-rotation-aware baseline. These results demonstrate that the proposed method provides an effective and highly efficient alternative to existing rotation-invariant CNN frameworks."

Federated satellite learning (FSL) enables joint model training without sharing raw data, but suffers from slow convergence due to intermittent connectivity and introduces critical trust challenges--where biased or falsified updates can arise across satellite constellations, including those injected through cyberattacks on inter-satellite or satellite-ground communication links. We propose OrbitChain, a blockchain-backed framework that empowers trustworthy multi-vendor collaboration in LEO networks. OrbitChain (i) offloads consensus to high-altitude platforms (HAPs) with greater computational capacity, (ii) ensures transparent, auditable provenance of model updates from different orbits owned by different vendors, and (iii) prevents manipulated or incomplete contributions from affecting global FSL model aggregation. Extensive simulations show that OrbitChain reduces computational and communication overhead while improving privacy, security, and global model accuracy. Its permissioned proof-of-authority ledger finalizes over 1000 blocks with sub-second latency (0.16,s, 0.26,s, 0.35,s for 1-of-5, 3-of-5, and 5-of-5 quorums). Moreover, OrbitChain reduces convergence time by up to 30 hours on real satellite datasets compared to single-vendor, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time, multi-vendor learning.

Media and fashion are central arbiters of these ideals, yet long-term, quantitative, intersectional studies on how representation has changed remain scarce. We assembled a dataset of 793199 records spanning 25 years of advertising, magazine covers, runway shows, and editorials to quantify changes in anthropometric and demographic representation. We find a paradox in the evolution of beauty ideals: while representational diversity has increased, the median model physique remains stable. This is driven by selective plus-size inclusion at the upper tail, while the typical physique continues to diverge from the US population. Intersectionally, non-white models are 4.5 times more likely to be plus-size, indicating that progress in size inclusivity falls disproportionately on multiple underrepresented identities. Stratifying the industry via a data-driven prestige hierarchy, we find that thinness is overrepresented at the top tier. Finally, comparing two regulatory interventions we observe that numeric thresholds are more effective at reducing underweight appearances. Our results quantify the cultural evolution in media and fashion, revealing that inclusion has increased; however, gains are uneven and intersectionally concentrated on size and ethnicity, whereas the prevailing thin ideal remains largely unchanged."

L_acc enforces consistency in the discrete second-order temporal differences of the generated motion, thereby aligning the diffusion prior with IMU-specific acceleration patterns. We integrate L_acc into the training objective of an existing diffusion model, finetune the model to obtain an IMU-specific motion prior, and evaluate the model with an existing text-to-IMU framework that comprises surface modelling and virtual sensor simulation. We analysed acceleration signal fidelity and differences between synthetic motion representation and actual IMU recordings. As a downstream application, we evaluated Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and compared the classification performance using data of our method with the earlier diffusion model and two additional diffusion model baselines. When we augmented the earlier diffusion model objective with L_acc and continued training, L_acc decreased by 12.7% relative to the original model. The improvements were considerably larger in high-dynamic activities (i.e., running, jumping) compared to low-dynamic activities~(i.e., sitting, standing). In a low-dimensional embedding, the synthetic IMU data produced by our refined model shifts closer to the distribution of real IMU recordings. HAR classification trained exclusively on our refined synthetic IMU data improved performance by 8.7% compared to the earlier diffusion model and by 7.6% over the best-performing comparison diffusion model. We conclude that acceleration-aware diffusion refinement provides an effective approach to align motion generation and IMU synthesis and highlights how flexible deep learning pipelines are for specialising generic text-to-motion priors to sensor-specific tasks."

We developed a mathematical model for Culex mosquito dynamics in a patchy landscape, integrating entomological observations, weather-driven factors, and the vector control practices of the Northwest Mosquito Abatement District (NWMAD) in Cook County, Illinois. By coupling a temperature-driven multi-patch ODE model with NWMAD's adulticide and larvicide interventions, we investigated how spatial heterogeneity and control timing influence mosquito abundance. We also evaluated how mosquito dispersal modifies intervention effectiveness by comparing single-patch and two-patch model outcomes. Our results showed that models ignoring spatial connectivity can substantially overestimate the impact of interventions or misidentify the thresholds of vector persistence. Through numerical simulations, we analysed continuous and pulsatile control approaches under varying spatial and temporal configurations. These findings provide insight into optimal strategies for managing Culex populations and mitigating mosquito-borne disease risk in weather-driven, spatially connected environments across Cook County, Illinois."

    "abstract": "With the NBA's adoption of in-game limb tracking in 2023, Sony's Hawk-Eye system now captures high-resolution, 3D poses of players and the ball 60 times per second. Linking these data to key events such as shots, passes, and rebounds opens a new era in NBA analytics. Here, we leverage Hawk-Eye tracking to introduce a novel ensemble of metrics for evaluating free-throw shooting and demonstrate that our framework captures skill more effectively than traditional make-or-miss statistics. Inspired by baseball analytics, we introduce command, which quantifies the quality of a free throw by measuring a shooter's accuracy and precision near the basket's bullseye. This metric recognizes that some makes (or misses) are better than others and captures a player's ability to execute quality attempts consistently. To identify what drives command, we define launch-based metrics assessing consistency in release velocity, angle, and 3D position. Players with greater touch -- i.e., more consistent launch dynamics -- exhibit stronger command as they can reliably control their shot trajectory. Finally, we develop a physics model to identify the range of launch conditions that result in a make and to determine which launch conditions are most robust to small perturbations. This framework reveals \"safe\" launch regions and explains why certain players, such as Steph Curry, excel at free throws, providing actionable insights for player development."

To justify use of SMD, one should be reasonably confident that the group-level variances are equal. Empirical evidence often contradicts this assumption. Thus, we have investigated an alternate approach, based on stochastic ordering of the treatment and control distributions, that takes into account means and variances. For applying stochastic ordering, our development yields a key quantity, $\\mathsf{A}$, the outcome value at which the direction of the ordering of the treatment and control distributions changes. Using an extensive simulation, we studied relative bias of point estimators of $\\mathsf{A}$ and coverage and relative width of bootstrap confidence intervals."

A standard siren measurement with a nearby (luminosity distance $\\sim 40 $ Mpc) event such as GW170817 is typically sensitive to the peculiar motion of the host galaxy due to local dynamics. Previous measurements from this event have taken advantage of peculiar velocity measurements of nearby galaxies, including a handful of objects in the galaxy group that the host of the event, NGC 4993, has been associated with. Still, the group's properties and NGC 4993's membership were debated. We present DESI observations of thousands of galaxies in the vicinity of NGC 4993, resulting in 39 group galaxies and a five-fold increase in galaxies compared to previous observations with many of these galaxies contributing to a peculiar velocity measurement. Examining the local dynamics, our observations support the presence of a galaxy group of which NGC 4993 is part with a halo mass of order $\\sim$$10^{13}~M_\\odot$. Using peculiar velocity measurements from our Fundamental Plane galaxies observations, we find $H_0 =70.9^{+6.4}_{-8.5}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. In addition, using a peculiar velocity measurement for NGC 4993 from Surface Brightness Fluctuations in Cosmicflows-4 we find $H_0 =73.4^{+3.3}_{-3.9}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We study the impact of different galaxy selection criteria on the determination of the peculiar velocity and, in turn, on the $H_0$ measurement. Our results highlight the importance of multiplexed spectroscopic observations of the environments of gravitational wave events to probe local dynamics, which can ultimately affect standard siren measurements."

    "abstract": "Neurons, as eukaryotic cells, have powerful internal computation capabilities. One neuron can have many distinct states, and brains can use this capability. Processes of neuron growth and maintenance use chemical signalling between cell bodies and synapses, ferrying chemical messengers over microtubules and actin fibres within cells. These processes are computations which, while slower than neural electrical signalling, could allow any neuron to change its state over intervals of seconds or minutes. Based on its state, a single neuron can selectively de-activate some of its synapses, sculpting a dynamic neural net from the static neural connections of the brain. Without this dynamic selection, the static neural networks in brains are too amorphous and dilute to do the computations of neural cognitive models. The use of multi-state neurons in animal brains is illustrated in hierarchical Bayesian object recognition. Multi-state neurons may support a design which is more efficient than two-state neurons, and scales better as object complexity increases. Brains could have evolved to use multi-state neurons. Multi-state neurons could be used in artificial neural networks, to use a kind of non-Hebbian learning which is faster and more focused and controllable than traditional neural net learning. This possibility has not yet been explored in computational models."

    "abstract": "With the rise of large language models, service providers offer language models as a service, enabling users to fine-tune customized models via uploaded private datasets. However, this raises concerns about sensitive data leakage. Prior methods, relying on differential privacy within device-cloud collaboration frameworks, struggle to balance privacy and utility, exposing users to inference attacks or degrading fine-tuning performance. To address this, we propose PrivTune, an efficient and privacy-preserving fine-tuning framework via Split Learning (SL). The key idea of PrivTune is to inject crafted noise into token representations from the SL bottom model, making each token resemble the $n$-hop indirect neighbors. PrivTune formulates this as an optimization problem to compute the optimal noise vector, aligning with defense-utility goals. On this basis, it then adjusts the parameters (i.e., mean) of the $d_χ$-Privacy noise distribution to align with the optimization direction and scales the noise according to token importance to minimize distortion. Experiments on five datasets (covering both classification and generation tasks) against three embedding inversion and three attribute inference attacks show that, using RoBERTa on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset, PrivTune reduces the attack success rate to 10% with only a 3.33% drop in utility performance, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines."

When mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), they benefit from flexible deployment and improved line-of-sight conditions. Despite their promising potential, a comprehensive performance comparison between aerial RIS and STAR-RIS architectures has not been thoroughly investigated. This letter presents a detailed performance comparison between aerial RIS and STAR-RIS in three-dimensional wireless environments. Accurate channel models incorporating directional radiation patterns are established, and the influence of deployment altitude and orientation is thoroughly examined. To optimize the system sum-rate, we formulate joint optimization problems for both architectures and propose an efficient solution based on the weighted minimum mean square error and block coordinate descent algorithms. Simulation results reveal that STAR-RIS outperforms RIS in low-altitude scenarios due to its full-space coverage capability, whereas RIS delivers better performance near the base station at higher altitudes. The findings provide practical insights for the deployment of aerial intelligent surfaces in future 6G communication systems."

    "abstract": "Dark photons, a generic class of light gauge bosons that interact with the Standard Model (SM) exclusively through kinetic mixing, arise naturally in many gauge extensions of the SM. Motivated by these theoretical considerations, we present a comprehensive analysis of their thermal production in the early universe. Our calculation covers a broad range of dark photon masses from 0.1 keV to 100 MeV and include inverse decay, annihilation, and semi-Compton processes. Wherever possible, we present analytical estimates of the production rates and yields, and verify their accuracy numerically. For dark photons lighter than twice the electron masses (around 1 MeV), we find that our analytical estimate of the freeze-in yield based on resonant production is very accurate, implying that off-resonance contributions can be neglected in practice. For heavy dark photons, although this conclusion no longer holds, we derive an interesting ratio, $4πe/27\\approx0.14$, with $e$ the coupling constant of QED, that can be used to estimate the relative importance of on- and off-resonance contributions. Finally, using the calculated abundance of dark photons in the early universe, we derive cosmological constraints on the dark photon mass and kinetic mixing. Compared with bounds from stellar cooling and supernovae, the cosmological constraints are most stringent in the mass range from 0.1 MeV to 6 MeV, within which kinetic mixing at the level of $10^{-12}\\sim10^{-10}$ can be probed."

We show robust performance improvements under various conditions: imperfect photon sources down to complete distinguishability; scenarios with severe class imbalances, classifying both handwritten digits and biomedical images; and sparse data, maintaining model accuracy with twenty times less training data. Crucially, we demonstrate the acceleration and scalability of our scheme on a photonic quantum processing unit, providing the first experimental validation that boson-sampling-enhanced learning delivers real performance gains on actual quantum hardware."

However, world models with the ability to predict long-horizon futures from past observations and actions remain underexplored, especially for general-purpose scenarios and various forms of actions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Astra, an interactive general world model that generates real-world futures for diverse scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving, robot grasping) with precise action interactions (e.g., camera motion, robot action). We propose an autoregressive denoising architecture and use temporal causal attention to aggregate past observations and support streaming outputs. We use a noise-augmented history memory to avoid over-reliance on past frames to balance responsiveness with temporal coherence. For precise action control, we introduce an action-aware adapter that directly injects action signals into the denoising process. We further develop a mixture of action experts that dynamically route heterogeneous action modalities, enhancing versatility across diverse real-world tasks such as exploration, manipulation, and camera control. Astra achieves interactive, consistent, and general long-term video prediction and supports various forms of interactions. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the improvements of Astra in fidelity, long-range prediction, and action alignment over existing state-of-the-art world models."

    "abstract": "When a star passes within the Roche limit of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), it is pulled apart by the BH's tidal field in a tidal disruption event (TDE). The resulting flare is powered by the circularization and accretion of bound stellar debris, which initially returns to the BH on eccentric orbits in a thin debris stream. The returning fluid elements follow inclined orbits that converge near pericenter, resulting in extreme vertical compression to scales $10^{-4}~R_\\odot$ and the formation of a nozzle shock. Dissipation at the nozzle shock may affect circularization by altering the properties of the debris stream, but its role is the subject of ongoing debate. We develop an idealized model for the debris stream evolution combining 3D smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations, the semi-analytic affine model, and 1D finite-volume hydrodynamic simulations. Because our model is computationally cheap, we can unambiguously resolve the nozzle shock, use a realistic equation of state, and follow the debris stream evolution at many different times. Near peak fallback, Hydrogen recombination and molecular Hydrogen formation broaden the stream by a factor $\\sim 5$, enhancing dissipation at the nozzle. However, the dissipation is still insufficient to directly circularize the debris by in-plane pressure gradients. Instead, the thicker stream substantially increases the likelihood that the stream self-intersects on the second orbit, despite relativistic nodal precession. The stream properties at self-intersection are sensitive to dissipation at the nozzle and the timing of focal points where the ballistic trajectories of the debris converge. Our results clarify the nozzle shock's role in circularization in TDEs, providing a foundation for more realistic circularization and emission models."

Building on foundational work by Fomin, Shapiro, and Thurston connecting cluster algebras to triangulated surfaces, recent research has extended mutation theory to infinite settings, including the infinity-gon and more general marked surfaces. In this paper, we develop a purely combinatorial framework for mutation of infinite quivers, independent of but compatible with these topological constructions. By formalizing infinite quivers as limits of embedded finite quivers, we establish a consistent definition of mutation that generalizes prior surface-based results. We then apply this framework to extend the notion of reddening sequences, special mutation sequences with significant algebraic consequences, from the finite to the infinite setting. Our approach not only unifies previous topological and combinatorial perspectives but also provides a technical foundation for further generalizations of cluster algebra theory in the infinite case."

We apply our analysis to small quantum codes, and show that they exhibit non-Markovian dynamics even for very simple physical noise models. We show that non-Markovianity can emerge from Markovian physical operations if (and only if) the physical qubits are not necessarily returned to the code subspace after every round of QEC. In this situation, the syndrome qubits can act as a memory, mediating time correlations and enabling violation of the Markov condition.

In practice, two primary approaches have emerged for adapting LLMs to tabular data generation: (i) fine-tuning smaller models directly on tabular datasets, and (ii) prompting larger models with examples provided in context. In this work, we show that popular implementations from both regimes exhibit a tendency to compromise privacy by reproducing memorized patterns of numeric digits from their training data. To systematically analyze this risk, we introduce a simple No-box Membership Inference Attack (MIA) called LevAtt that assumes adversarial access to only the generated synthetic data and targets the string sequences of numeric digits in synthetic observations. Using this approach, our attack exposes substantial privacy leakage across a wide range of models and datasets, and in some cases, is even a perfect membership classifier on state-of-the-art models. Our findings highlight a unique privacy vulnerability of LLM-based synthetic data generation and the need for effective defenses. To this end, we propose two methods, including a novel sampling strategy that strategically perturbs digits during generation. Our evaluation demonstrates that this approach can defeat these attacks with minimal loss of fidelity and utility of the synthetic data."

While Federated Learning (FL) has proven effective on static datasets, its extension to the open-ended self-evolution of agents remains underexplored. Directly applying standard FL is challenging: heterogeneous tasks and sparse, trajectory-level rewards introduce severe gradient conflicts, destabilizing the global optimization process. To bridge this gap, we propose Fed-SE, a Federated Self-Evolution framework for LLM agents. Fed-SE establishes a local evolution-global aggregation paradigm. Locally, agents employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning on filtered, high-return trajectories to achieve stable gradient updates. Globally, Fed-SE aggregates updates within a low-rank subspace that disentangles environment-specific dynamics, effectively reducing negative transfer across clients. Experiments across five heterogeneous environments demonstrate that Fed-SE improves average task success rates by approximately 18% over federated baselines, validating its effectiveness in robust cross-environment knowledge transfer in privacy-constrained deployments."

    "abstract": "Hoeffding's Inequality provides the maximum probability that a series of n draws from a bounded random variable differ from the variable's true expectation u by more than given tolerance t. The random variable is typically the error rate of a classifier in machine learning applications. Here, a trading strategy is premised on the assumption of an underlying distribution of causal factors, in other words, a market regime, and the random variable is the performance of that trading strategy. A larger deviation of observed performance from the trader's expectation u can be characterized as a lower probability that the financial regime supporting that strategy remains in force, and a higher probability of financial regime change. The changing Hoeffding probabilities can be used as an early warning indicator of this change."

    "abstract": "Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology is advancing seismic monitoring by providing dense observations near earthquake sources. However, the resulting data volumes often limit real-time processing capability, with most seismological applications focusing on retrospective analysis of seismic sequences. To address this challenge, we introduce ORION, a fast and versatile selector of high-quality DAS channels that efficiently reduces the amount of data to analyze. The method first adopts spatial clustering to identify cable segments with similar geometrical attributes (e.g, azimuth), and then performs channel selection within each section using waveform attributes (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio); this approach enables spatial sub-sampling while preserving azimuthal coverage. We demonstrate the flexibility of the selector across several cable geometries. Finally, we analyze a seismic sequence using ORION-selected channels and compare the source locations with those from a more conventional uniform distribution of channels along the cable, showing improvements in hypocenter accuracy."

    "abstract": "The renormalization of higher-dimensional operators in quantum field theory is essential for phenomenological analyses in particle physics, and plays a significant role in the study of critical phenomena. We present a framework for renormalizing general bosonic effective field theories beyond one loop, with arbitrary gauge symmetry and scalar field content. In particular, we calculate the renormalization group equations in such theories up to two loops and dimension six. When specialized to the bosonic sector of the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT) using simple replacement rules, our general expressions reproduce recent results from the literature. Due to the broad applicability of effective field theory, our general results can readily be applied to obtain the anomalous dimensions in extensions of the bosonic SMEFT and in a plethora of other theories. We also envision our results to provide useful data on the scaling dimensions of composite operators in conformal field theories without fermions."

Existing discovery methods depend on unreliable user descriptions or biased popularity metrics, hindering usability. We present CARLoS, a large-scale framework for characterizing LoRAs without requiring additional metadata. Analyzing over 650 LoRAs, we employ them in image generation over a variety of prompts and seeds, as a credible way to assess their behavior. Using CLIP embeddings and their difference to a base-model generation, we concisely define a three-part representation: Directions, defining semantic shift; Strength, quantifying the significance of the effect; and Consistency, quantifying how stable the effect is. Using these representations, we develop an efficient retrieval framework that semantically matches textual queries to relevant LoRAs while filtering overly strong or unstable ones, outperforming textual baselines in automated and human evaluations. While retrieval is our primary focus, the same representation also supports analyses linking Strength and Consistency to legal notions of substantiality and volition, key considerations in copyright, positioning CARLoS as a practical system with broader relevance for LoRA analysis."

    "abstract": "Observational evidence has continued to mount that a significant fraction of rapidly rotating early-B type stars are products of binary mass transfer. However, very few mid- and late-type B stars with rapid rotation have been demonstrated to be post-interaction products, despite a growing sample of SB1 binaries among stars within this range of spectral types. By considering the currently available information over the entire range of rapidly rotating B-type binaries, we argue that a significant fraction of the mid- and late-type rapid rotators found in binaries are also likely the result of past mass transfer episodes. The observed properties of this sample are compared to the predictions from the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis code (BPASS), with attention given to the expected evolutionary pathways of stripped stars and the stellar and binary properties of both components of post-interaction systems across a range of initial conditions. Prospects for directly detecting and characterizing the stripped cores of the previous mass donors in such systems are described, and the implications for the role of binary interaction in causing rapid rotation are discussed. An accurate description of prevalence of binary interaction, the physics of mass transfer, and the post-interaction configuration of systems over a range of initial conditions has far-reaching implications including double-degenerate binaries and their eventual mergers, the output of ionizing UV flux of stellar populations, and the supernova explosions that can arise from stripped or rapidly-rotating progenitors."

    "abstract": "Full waveform inversion (FWI) has become a widely adopted technique for high-resolution subsurface imaging. However, its inherent strong nonlinearity often results in convergence toward local minima. Recently, deep image prior-based reparameterized FWI (DIP-FWI) has been proposed to alleviate the dependence on massive training data. By exploiting the spectral bias and implicit regularization in the neural network architecture, DIP-FWI can effectively avoid local minima and reconstruct more geologically plausible velocity models. Nevertheless, existing DIP-FWI typically use a fixed random input throughout the inversion process, which fails to utilize the mapping and correlation between the input and output of the network. Moreover, under complex geological conditions, the lack of informative prior in the input can exacerbate the ill-posedness of the inverse problem, leading to artifacts and unstable reconstructions. To address these limitations, we propose a self-reinforced DIP-FWI (SRDIP-FWI) framework, in which a steering algorithm alternately updates both the network parameters and the input at each iteration using feedback from the current network output. This design allows adaptive structural enhancement and improved regularization, thereby effectively mitigating the ill-posedness in FWI. Additionally, we analyze the spectral bias of the network in SRDIP-FWI and quantify its role in multiscale velocity model building. Synthetic tests and field land data application demonstrate that SRDIP-FWI achieves superior resolution, improved accuracy and greater depth penetration compared to multiscale FWI. More importantly, SRDIP-FWI eliminates the need for manual frequency-band selection and time-window picking, substantially simplifying the inversion workflow. Overall, the proposed method provides a novel, adaptive and robust framework for accurate subsurface velocity model reconstruction."

They are particularly effective for accelerating convergence rates with optimal complexity in terms of both time and space. K-cycle orthonormalization multigrid is a robust variant of the multigrid method that combines the efficiency of multigrid with the robustness of Krylov-type residual minimalizations for problems with strong anisotropies. However, traditional implementations of K-cycle orthonormalization multigrid often rely on bulk-synchronous parallelism, which can limit scalability on modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems. This paper presents a task-parallel variant of the K-cycle orthonormalization multigrid method that leverages asynchronous execution to improve scalability and performance on large-scale parallel systems."

By calculating the Zak phase we show that also in the presence of the substrate there is a topological phase transition and that topologically protected edge modes emerge for finite chains. Finally, we demonstrate the long-range heat transport along the chain due to the coupling to the surface waves of the sample. We find an enhanced heat transfer in the topological non-trivial phase compared to the trivial phase due to the contribution of the edge modes."

As a basic set-up, we consider the probes to be inertial in flat spacetime and investigate how the radiative process is affected by different probe configurations. We take the quantum probes as either static or moving with uniform velocities and consider different switching scenarios. Our main observation confirms that the radiative process depends distinctively on the initial configuration in which the probes are arranged, as well as on the direction of the probe velocity. We also extend our analysis to a thermal environment, thereby simulating a more realistic background. We thoroughly discuss the effects due to different switchings, the thermal background, and probe motion on the radiative process of these tripartite entangled probes. We also comment on how the observations from this work can help prepare a set-up least affected by quantum decoherence."

These nanostructures support Mie-type resonances that modify the local density of optical states. Specifically, the silicon dimer provides polarization-dependent electric and magnetic field enhancement in the dimer gap to modify the electric dipolar and magnetic dipolar emissions of the Eu3+ at 610 nm and 590 nm, respectively. Finite element method simulations are used to determine the optimal parameters for the sample and to demonstrate the polarization-dependent emission enhancement of dipolar emitters in the gap. A two-step electron beam lithography process is used to fabricate the hybrid nanoscopic structures, with a Eu3+ doped electron beam resist located only in the center of the dimer. The results demonstrate the potential of these nanostructures to selectively tailor the emission of the two distinct dipolar transitions by engineering the resonant nanostructures.

    "abstract": "Next-generation communication and localization systems increasingly rely on extremely large-scale arrays (XL-arrays), which promise unprecedented spatial resolution and new functionalities. These gains arise from their inherent operation in the near field (NF) regime, where the spherical nature of the wavefront can no longer be ignored; consequently, characterizing the ambiguity function -- which amounts to the matched beam pattern -- is considerably more challenging. Implementing very wide apertures with half-wavelength element spacing is costly and complex. This motivates thinning the array (removing elements), which introduces intricate aliasing structures, i.e., grating lobes. Whereas prior work has addressed this challenge using approximations tailored to specific array geometries, this paper develops a general framework that reveals the fundamental origins and geometric behavior of grating lobes in near-field ambiguity functions. Using a local spatial-frequency analysis of steering signals, we derive a systematic methodology to model NF grating lobes as aliasing artifacts, quantifying their structure on the AF, and providing design guidelines for XL-arrays that operate within aliasing-safe regions. We further connect our framework to established far-field principles. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of the approach by deriving closed-form expressions for aliasing-free regions in canonical uniform linear arrays and uniform circular arrays."

To tackle such challenges, SDAR tightly knit together its dependency-driven task planner (SDAR-T) and synchronous dual-arm motion planner (SDAR-M), to intelligently sift through a large number of possible task and motion plans. Specifically, SDAR-T applies a simple yet effective strategy to decompose the global object dependency graph induced by the rearrangement task, to produce more optimal dual-arm task plans than solutions derived from optimal task plans for a single arm. Leveraging state-of-the-art GPU SIMD-based motion planning tools, SDAR-M employs a layered motion planning strategy to sift through many task plans for the best synchronous dual-arm motion plan while ensuring high levels of success rate. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SDAR delivers a 100% success rate in solving complex, non-monotone, long-horizon tabletop rearrangement tasks with solution quality far exceeding the previous state-of-the-art. Experiments on two UR-5e arms further confirm SDAR directly and reliably transfers to robot hardware."

For finite $n$, the associated Jimbo-Miwa-Okamoto $σ$-forms are $\\PIV$ (GUE), $\\mathrm{PV}$ (LUE), and $\\PVI$ (JUE); under soft- or hard-edge scalings these degenerate to $\\PII$ or $\\PIIIp$ descriptions of the Tracy-Widom and hard-edge laws \\cite{tracy1994level,forrester2003painleve,deift1999orthogonal}. It is well known among random matrix theorists (for example Folkmar Bornemann) that the Fredholm determinant is a more numerically stable and accurate way to compute the CDF of the largest eigenvalue for GUE, LUE, JUE than direct Painlevé integration. The aim of this paper is not to improve on Fredholm methods, but to see to what extent one can numerically recover the \\emph{correct} Painlevé solution from finite-$n$ data and how unstable this reconstruction is. Numerically, we verify the equality between the Fredholm- and Painlevé-based CDFs by combining (a) high-accuracy Nyström discretizations of the finite-$n$ Fredholm determinants \\cite{bornemann2010numerical} with (b) an anchored, branch-locked integration of the $σ$-form ODEs, where anchors are extracted from local least-squares fits to $\\log\\det(I-\\mathsf K)$. Our results confirm agreement across GUE/LUE/JUE with precision of $O(10^{-3})$ to $O(10^{-5})$ (occasionally $O(10^{-2})$) and illustrate the finite-$n$ to scaling-limit transition.

    "abstract": "In empirical software engineering (SE) research, researchers have considerable freedom to decide how to process data, what operationalizations to use, and which statistical model to fit. Gelman and Loken refer to this freedom as leading to a \"garden of forking paths\". Although this freedom is often seen as an advantage, it also poses a threat to robustness and replicability: variations in analytical decisions, even when justifiable, can lead to divergent conclusions. To better understand this risk, we conducted a so-called multiverse analysis on a published empirical SE paper. The paper we picked is a Mining Software Repositories study, as MSR studies commonly use non-trivial statistical models to analyze post-hoc, observational data. In the study, we identified nine pivotal analytical decisions-each with at least one equally defensible alternative and systematically reran all the 3,072 resulting analysis pipelines on the original dataset. Interestingly, only 6 of these universes (<0.2%) reproduced the published results; the overwhelming majority produced qualitatively different, and sometimes even opposite, findings. This case study of a data analytical method commonly applied to empirical software engineering data reveals how methodological choices can exert a more profound influence on outcomes than is often acknowledged. We therefore advocate that SE researchers complement standard reporting with robustness checks across plausible analysis variants or, at least, explicitly justify each analytical decision. We propose a structured classification model to help classify and improve justification for methodological choices. Secondly, we show how the multiverse analysis is a practical tool in the methodological arsenal of SE researchers, one that can help produce more reliable, reproducible science."

We present a large and homogeneous sample of bright quasars identified from the Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) by combining high-purity candidate selections from Gaia and WISE with the NISP spectra. Through visual inspection of the Euclid spectra of these quasar candidates, we identify approximately 3500 quasars with reliable redshifts at $0<z\\lesssim 4.8$. We generate the first Euclid composite spectrum of quasars covering rest-frame NUV to NIR wavelengths without telluric lines, which will be pivotal to NIR quasar spectral analysis. We obtain an empirical spectroscopic depth of $J_{\\rm E}\\lesssim 21.5$ and $H_{\\rm E}\\lesssim 21.3$ at the sensitivity of the Wide Field Survey, beyond which the number of securely identified quasars declines sharply. We analyse VIS morphologies using Sersic and CAS metrics, and a deep-learning PSF fraction to track nuclear dominance. At low redshift ($z<0.5$), obvious host structures are common and a single Sersic model fits about half of the sources; at intermediate redshift ($0.5<z<2$), the nuclear component dominates, with 90% of the Sersic fits saturating at the upper index limit. In this intermediate redshift regime, $f_{\\rm PSF}$ is available, and we use it as a more reliable compactness measure than the single-Sersic and CAS parameters to quantify nuclear versus host emission. We also explore the novel Euclid NIR colour space and discuss the role of these quasars in refining AGN selection techniques for future Euclid data releases. Our results highlight the potential of Euclid spectroscopy to advance quasar surveys and enable the construction of more complete AGN catalogues.

    "abstract": "The potential of mean force (PMF) is an effective average potential acting on an open system, renormalized due to the interaction with the surrounding thermal bath. The PMF is defined for an equilibrium ensemble, and generally it is not clear how to use it when the system is out of equilibrium and described by a (generalized) Langevin equation. We study a model where the system is a single particle (so there are no complications related to internal forces) and a non-trivial PMF is due to the presence of on-site (anchor) potentials applied to the bath particles. We found that the PMF does not merely replace the external potential, but also makes the dissipation kernel and statistical properties of noise dependent on the system's position. That dependence is determined by the internal bath and system-bath interactions and is a priori unknown. Therefore, in the general case the Langevin equation with the PMF is not closed and thus inoperable. However, for systems with linear forces the aforementioned dependence on the system's position may be canceled. As an example, we consider a model where the bath is formed by the Klein-Gordon chain, i. e. a harmonic chain with on-site harmonic potentials. In that case, the generalized Langevin equation has the standard form with an external potential replaced by a quadratic PMF."

However, their aggregation and poor conductivity limit their catalytic activity. Consequently, researchers are exploring ways to improve the conductivity and density of electroactive edges of MoS2 through hybridization with akin advanced 2D materials. Here, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets are added to a liquid-phase-exfoliated MoS2 dispersion to create drop-casting hybrid MoS2@rGO electrodes for HER. The findings reveal the formation of ~1.1 nm-thick MoS2 bilayers, with the catalytic performance of MoS2@rGO dependent on the degree of graphene oxide reduction. The rGO moderate reduction prevents the MoS2 bilayers from restacking, improves conductivity, retains oxygenated groups that enhance interlayer spacing, and exposes more electroactive edges. When hybridized with rGO crafted at optimal reduction time, the hybrid system eclipses the efficiency of pristine MoS2 bilayers by attaining the lowest overpotential (~70 mV) and the lowest Tafel slope (~46 mV dec-1). This shows that MoS2 bilayers hybridized with rGO offer a promising method to outperform the electrocatalytic efficiency of MoS2-based electrodes. These findings expand opportunities for future strain engineering, defect engineering, and high-end twist-angle assemblies for hybrid systems combining MoS2 bilayers and rGO."

    "abstract": "We present a systematic search for signatures of terminal black-hole evaporation in short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) catalogs. An exploding primordial black hole (PBH) undergoing final-stage Hawking radiation is predicted to produce a distinctive \"backwards burst\"-a very short, spectrally hard transient with monotonically increasing flux and little or no longer-wavelength afterglow. We develop a forward-modeling framework that directly compares theoretical PBH evaporation light curves, computed with full Standard Model particle content and detector response folding, against empirical GRB pulse templates. Analyzing 39 well-characterized Swift sGRBs with non-detected or extremely faint afterglows, we find that all events exhibit fast-rise, slow-decay temporal profiles inconsistent with the PBH prediction. Model comparison via Akaike and Bayesian information criteria decisively favors conventional FRED or ERCA fits over the PBH template for every burst. No candidates for terminal PBH evaporation are identified. The null result yields an upper bound on the local PBH explosion rate density $R_{\\mathrm{PBH}} \\lesssim 10^5~\\mathrm{pc}^{-3}~\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, comparable to constraints from dedicated TeV $γ$-ray searches. Our methodology establishes a robust template-matching approach that can be scaled to larger multi-instrument catalogs, providing a foundation for future searches targeting this unique signature of quantum gravity and early-Universe physics."

    "abstract": "Facilitated by low-noise laser frequency locking, optical microresonators with the Pockels effect have shown unprecedented high resolutions in sensing electrical field. However, the requirement for tunable and low-noise laser sources considerably increases the cost and the size of the system, thereby limiting the industrial applicability of the microresonator-based technology. Here, we explore the possibility of using a low-cost fixed-frequency semiconductor laser as the pump laser to perform radiofrequency electrometry. A resonant mode in a lithium niobate microresonator is frequency-locked to the laser using the electrooptic effect. This same effect also underlies the radiofrequency electric-field sensing mechanism. Our experimental results show that the electrometry resolution can be maintained at signal frequencies beyond the optical resonance bandwidth and that the signal-to-noise ratio does not change with varied coupling conditions as long as the laser frequency noise is the dominant noise source of the system. In addition, narrowband electrooptic sensitivity enhancement is observed at frequencies of the microresonator's piezoelectric resonances, resulting in a resolution enhancement factor of approximately 3 at signal frequencies around 4 MHz. Our work advances the photonic resonant electrometry technology by studying the bandwidth limitation, and opens the road to the employment of low-cost lasers in high-resolution sensing applications."

Traditional analytical approaches often fall short when faced with complex robot structures and interactions. Data-driven methods offer a promising alternative, yet conventional neural networks such as recurrent models struggle to capture long-range dependencies critical for accurate estimation. In this study, we propose a Transformer-based approach for dynamic parameter estimation, supported by an automated pipeline that generates diverse robot models and enriched trajectory data using Jacobian-derived features. The dataset consists of 8,192 robots with varied inertial and frictional properties. Leveraging attention mechanisms, our model effectively captures both temporal and spatial dependencies. Experimental results highlight the influence of sequence length, sampling rate, and architecture, with the best configuration (sequence length 64, 64 Hz, four layers, 32 heads) achieving a validation R2 of 0.8633. Mass and inertia are estimated with near-perfect accuracy, Coulomb friction with moderate-to-high accuracy, while viscous friction and distal link center-of-mass remain more challenging. These results demonstrate that combining Transformers with automated dataset generation and kinematic enrichment enables scalable, accurate dynamic parameter estimation, contributing to improved sim-to-real transfer in robotic systems"

This study evaluates a range of summarization methods, from simple extractive techniques to advanced large language models (LLMs), using the FinLLMs Challenge dataset. LLMs generated more coherent and informative summaries, but they are resource-intensive and prone to hallucinations, which can introduce significant errors into financial summaries. In contrast, extractive methods perform well on short, well-structured texts and offer a more efficient alternative for this type of article.

However, such models are computationally intensive and large in size, making them unsuitable for deployment on edge devices. In addition, strict privacy constraints hinder centralized data management, motivating the adoption of Federated Learning (FL). To address these challenges, this study proposes a skewness-guided pruning method that selectively prunes the Multi-Head Self-Attention and Multi-Layer Perceptron layers of a multimodal Swin Transformer based on the statistical skewness of their output distributions. The proposed method was validated in a horizontal FL environment and shown to maintain performance while substantially reducing model complexity. Experiments on the compact Swin Transformer demonstrate approximately 36\\% model size reduction with no loss in accuracy. These findings highlight the feasibility of achieving efficient model compression and privacy-preserving distributed learning for multimodal medical AI on edge devices."

    "abstract": "The paper presents a two-phase hydrodynamic model for the numerical simulation of collective motion in a thin layer of active colloids containing spherical microswimmers. The model accounts for three fundamental mechanisms governing the dynamics of the active colloid: the random motion of the microswimmers, their mutual collisions, and their interaction with the surrounding fluid phase. The accurate resolution of the characteristic time scales associated with each mechanism is crucial for reproducing the different dynamic modes. The model reproduces two primary modes of motion: Brownian and collective, as well as the transition between them. It is demonstrated that hydrodynamic interactions begin to play a significant role when the microswimmer velocity exceeds a critical threshold. At this point, the kinetic energy transferred to the fluid phase is sufficient to generate a noticeable feedback effect on the swimmers' motion. Conversely, a further increase in microswimmers' velocity enhances the role of collisions, causing the system to revert from a collective mode back to a Brownian-like state. A similar transition occurs at higher volume fractions of microswimmers within the colloid."

However, the problem of sign-to-sign retrieval or detecting a specific sign within a sequence of continuous signs remains largely unexplored. We define this novel task as Sign Language Spotting. In this paper, we present a first step toward sign language retrieval by addressing the challenge of detecting the presence or absence of a query sign video within a sentence-level gloss or sign video. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on intermediate gloss recognition or text-based matching, we propose an end-to-end model that directly operates on pose keypoints extracted from sign videos. Our architecture employs an encoder-only backbone with a binary classification head to determine whether the query sign appears within the target sequence. By focusing on pose representations instead of raw RGB frames, our method significantly reduces computational cost and mitigates visual noise. We evaluate our approach on the Word Presence Prediction dataset from the WSLP 2025 shared task, achieving 61.88\\% accuracy and 60.00\\% F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our pose-based framework for Sign Language Spotting, establishing a strong foundation for future research in automatic sign language retrieval and verification.

While these approaches have made progress, they often face challenges in precise localization or require complex pipelines to combine separate modules, especially in remote sensing scenarios where numerous dense and small targets are present. Recently, Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM 3) was proposed, unifying segmentation and recognition in a promptable framework. In this paper, we present a preliminary exploration of applying SAM 3 to the remote sensing OVSS task without any training. First, we implement a mask fusion strategy that combines the outputs from SAM 3's semantic segmentation head and the Transformer decoder (instance head). This allows us to leverage the strengths of both heads for better land coverage. Second, we utilize the presence score from the presence head to filter out categories that do not exist in the scene, reducing false positives caused by the vast vocabulary sizes and patch-level processing in geospatial scenes. We evaluate our method on extensive remote sensing datasets. Experiments show that this simple adaptation achieves promising performance, demonstrating the potential of SAM 3 for remote sensing OVSS.

    "abstract": "Stably stratified fluids subject to sustained forcing are known to develop step-like density \"staircases\", where nearly homogeneous layers alternate with thin interfaces of strong stratification. However, long-time numerical investigations of this phenomenon have been limited by the intrinsically slow evolution of large-scale modes and the sensitivity of stratified turbulence to physical parameters. We present direct numerical simulations of forced Boussinesq flows for three stratification strengths (Fr = 0.42, 0.22, 0.076) and of unprecedented time extensions - up to O(10000) turnover times - with the purpose of reproducing and studying the very slow coarsening of the layered state. A large-scale friction term is introduced to arrest shear-mode growth and mimic finite-domain constraints. Staircase formation is observed for both medium and strong stratified cases, following two different coarsening dynamics: interfaces decaying or merging. While kinetic energy remains quasi-stationary during interface decay, it exhibits sharp bursts during merging events. The emergence and persistence of density steps can be explained by the non-monotonic relation between buoyancy flux and buoyancy gradient. Intermittency in vertical velocity and density fluctuations is confined to the vicinity of layer-interface boundaries, indicating that strong events arise from the interaction between turbulent mixing and layer formation rather than from regions of large density gradients alone."

By performing the Bruhat preclosure an infinite number of times we obtain a closure which we call the infinite Bruhat closure. We show in a uniform way that Dyer's conjecture is true when using the infinite Bruhat closure (instead of Bruhat preclosure) if the join exists between two elements. Finally, we end by showing in type A, the Bruhat preclosure is a closure thus giving a (second) proof that Dyer's conjecture is true in type A."

We report here on the X-ray monitoring of Swift J1555.2-5402 over the first ~29 months of its outburst with Swift, NICER, NuSTAR, INTEGRAL and Insight-HXMT, as well as radio observations with Parkes soon after the outburst onset. The observed 0.3-10 keV flux remained at levels >~1e-11 erg/cm^2/s for nearly 500 days before dropping by a factor of ~10 from its June 2021 peak towards the end of the monitoring campaign. During this time span, the spectrum was dominated by a single blackbody, with temperature attaining approximately a constant value (~1.2 keV) while the inferred radius shrank from ~1.7 km to ~0.3 km (assuming a source distance of 10 kpc). The long-term spin-down rate (Pdot~3.6e-11 s/s) is only ~15 % higher than that measured in the first 30 days. No periodic or burst-like radio emission was detected, in line with what has been previously reported using different radio facilities. The persistently high temperature, shrinking hotspot, and a prolonged bright flux plateau followed by a fast dimming observed during the outburst evolution pose a challenge for the outburst mechanisms proposed so far."

Recently, this framework is extended to characterize quantum phase transitions in arXiv:2509.20258 by introducing the concepts of non-Hermitian symmetry breaking and fidelity zeros. Here, we generalize the theory by studying a broad class of quantum models, including the XY model, the XXZ model, the XYZ model, and the $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model in one dimension, subject to complex external magnetic field. For the XY, XXZ and XYZ models, we find that the complex field breaks parity symmetry and induces oscillations of the ground state between the two parity sectors, giving rise to fidelity zeros within the ordered phases. For the $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model, the complex field splits the real part of the ground-state energy between the neutral sector ($q=0$) and the charged sectors ($q=1,2$), while preserving the degeneracy within the charged sector. Fidelity zeros arise only after projecting out one of the charged sectors, and the finite-size scaling of these zeros produces critical exponents fully consistent with analytical predictions."

Using a tight-binding model on the Honeycomb lattice inspired by the frontier electronic states of CTFs, we show that introducing an effective uniaxial strain--implemented as a modulation of electron hopping on a subset of bonds--can generate a series of distinct topological band structures. This effect can be realized in practice through chemical substitution of linkers along the strained bonds.

By treating the two light quarks as a tightly bound diquark, the five-body system reduces to a four-body heavy quark-heavy quark-diquark-antiquark configuration. Within the constituent quark model framework, we calculate their mass spectra in the range of 4.7-5.4 GeV and corresponding internal mass contributions via the Gaussian expansion method. The root-mean-square radii, typically between 1.1-1.6 fm, indicate compact spatial structures. Furthermore, we also calculate the rearrangement decay widths via the quark-interchange model, finding that all states are unstable and decay into a singly-charmed baryon and a singly-charmed meson. Several narrow resonances have been identified, some of which have a total width even below 10 MeV. We hope that our study could provide valuable guidance for future theoretical investigations and experimental searches targeting doubly-charmed pentaquarks."

We show that the signal cross section is highly sensitive to $m_{Z^\\prime}$ and the effective parameters $\\tilde{g}/m_{Z^\\prime}$, while remaining largely insensitive to the triplet Yukawa couplings within the phenomenologically allowed region. The forward-backward asymmetry exhibits a characteristic monotonic dependence on $m_{Z^\\prime}$, and beam polarization can significantly suppress Standard Model backgrounds while enhancing new physics contributions. We find that over the phenomenologically allowed parameter space, the predicted observables remain highly sensitive to the underlying model parameters. These results demonstrate that multi-lepton final states are powerful probes of the $U(1)_{Lμ- L_τ}$ framework and offer valuable guidance for future searches at muon and electron-positron colliders."

    "abstract": "Efficient edge caching reduces latency and alleviates backhaul congestion in modern networks. Traditional caching policies, such as Least Recently Used (LRU) and Least Frequently Used (LFU), perform well under specific request patterns. LRU excels in workloads with strong temporal locality, while LFU is effective when content popularity remains static. However, real-world client requests often exhibit correlations due to shared contexts and coordinated activities. This is particularly evident in Virtual Reality (VR) environments, where groups of clients navigate shared virtual spaces, leading to correlated content requests. In this paper, we introduce the \\textit{grouped client request model}, a generalization of the Independent Reference Model that explicitly captures different types of request correlations. Our theoretical analysis of LRU under this model reveals that the optimal causal caching policy depends on cache size: LFU is optimal for small to moderate caches, while LRU outperforms it for larger caches. To address the limitations of existing policies, we propose Least Following and Recently Used (LFRU), a novel online caching policy that dynamically infers and adapts to causal relationships in client requests to optimize evictions. LFRU prioritizes objects likely to be requested based on inferred dependencies, achieving near-optimal performance compared to the offline optimal Belady policy in structured correlation settings. We develop VR based datasets to evaluate caching policies under realistic correlated requests. Our results show that LFRU consistently performs at least as well as LRU and LFU, outperforming LRU by up to 2.9x and LFU by up to1.9x in certain settings."

Efficient inverse design benefits from differentiable models of light-structure interaction. While traditional full-wave solvers based on finite differences, finite elements, or Fourier modal methods have already been presented for that purpose, a dedicated tool adapted for performing multiple scattering simulations is still lacking. To overcome this limitation, we provide a multiple-scattering framework compatible to automatic differentiation, suitable for treating periodic and non-periodic arrangements of scatterers. It yields exact gradients regarding geometric and positional parameters in finite clusters and infinite metasurfaces. In this work, we use spheres as the elementary building blocks to demonstrate the framework's capabilities as a standalone tool. However, the framework is adaptable to arbitrarily shaped scatterers, provided the individual T-matrices are calculated using differentiable full-wave Maxwell solvers. Since the gradients are obtained simultaneously in a single backward pass, the framework is well-suited for moderately dimensional problems. It is also possible to combine multiple performance goals into a single objective function. The versatility of our method is illustrated in proof-of-concept examples that focus on various aspects of Kerker-type physics. In the first example, a finite cluster of scatterers is optimized in order to reach a high forward-to-backward scattering ratio, and we show experimental feasibility of the designs. In the second example, a metasurface made from multiple scatterers in each unit cell is designed to maximize the reflectance contrast between orthogonal linear polarizations of the incident light.

Analytic greybody bounds are derived for spin-0, spin-1, spin-2, and spin-1/2 fields. Furthermore, full greybody factors are computed with the sixth-order WKB method, together with the corresponding absorption cross sections and their characteristic spin-dependent peak patterns. These results support the evaluation of the evaporation lifetimes and the emission rates of energy and particle modes associated with each spin contribution, followed by a comparison of the high-frequency regime with other Lorentz-violating geometries, including the \\textit{metric} bumblebee, \\textit{metric-affine} bumblebee, Kalb-Ramond, and non-commutative Kalb-Ramond black holes.

To date, advanced discrimination has relied on Deep Learning approaches employing e.g. Denoising Autoencoders (DAE) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). While effective, these models require tens of thousands of parameters and heavy pre-processing. In this work, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first application of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to real, experimental pulse waveforms from a germanium detector. We propose a quantum-classical hybrid approach using Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) with amplitude encoding. By mapping the 1024-sample waveforms directly into a 10-qubit Hilbert space, we demonstrate that a VQC with only 302 trainable parameters achieves a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98 and a global accuracy of 97.1%. This result demonstrates that even in the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, quantum models can match the performance of state-of-the-art classical baselines while reducing model complexity by over two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we envision a scenario where future quantum sensors transmit quantum states directly to such processing units, exploiting the exponentially large Hilbert space in a natively quantum pipeline."

The main difficulty lies in controlling the nonlinear coupling between the kinetic and electrostatic fields and establishing uniform bounds with respect to the scaling parameter. These challenges are overcome by developing refined high-order energy methods that yield uniform energy estimates and ensure the global well-posedness of smooth solutions, without relying on any a priori assumptions for the limiting DDP system."

Traditional methods for determining optimum moisture content (OMC) and maximum dry density (MDD) involve labor-intensive laboratory experiments, and empirical regression models have limited applicability and accuracy across diverse soil types. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as alternatives for predicting these compaction parameters. However, ML models often struggle with prediction accuracy and generalizability, particularly with heterogeneous datasets representing various soil types. This study proposes an automated machine learning (AutoML) approach to predict OMC and MDD. AutoML automates algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization, potentially improving accuracy and scalability. Through extensive experimentation, the study found that the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm provided the best performance, achieving R-squared values of 80.4% for MDD and 89.1% for OMC on a separate dataset. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoML in predicting compaction parameters across different soil types. The study also highlights the importance of heterogeneous datasets in improving the generalization and performance of ML models. Ultimately, this research contributes to more efficient and reliable construction practices by enhancing the prediction of soil compaction parameters."

However, operating in contested environments requires solving a complex trade-off, including maximizing system throughput while ensuring collision avoidance and resilience against adversarial jamming. Existing heuristic-based approaches often struggle to find effective solutions due to the dynamic and multi-objective nature of this problem. This paper formulates this challenge as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem, solved using the Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) framework. Our approach employs a centralized critic that uses global state information to guide decentralized actors which operate using only local observations. Simulation results show that our proposed framework significantly outperforms heuristic baselines, increasing the total system throughput by approximately 50% while simultaneously achieving a near-zero collision rate. A key finding is that the agents develop an emergent anti-jamming strategy without explicit programming. They learn to intelligently position themselves to balance the trade-off between mitigating interference from jammers and maintaining effective communication links with ground users."

We identify critical thresholds ($R=1$) that separate pandemic and contained phases in the $\\bar{k}_{+}-τ$ plane, validated using high-resolution data from Shenzhen's 2022 Omicron outbreak (1,187 cases, 86,451 contacts). Our findings show that contact tracing alone can contain diseases with $R_0 < 2.12$ (95% CI 2.07-2.16), covering 43.33% of major infectious diseases, while combining with social distancing extends control to $R_0 < 7.82$ (95% CI 7.70-7.93), encompassing 86.67% of pathogens. These results, supported by empirical data, highlight the efficacy of rapid tracing and targeted social distancing as alternatives to mass PCR testing.

Although various adaptive convolution methods have been proposed to address this limitation, they often suffer from excessive computational costs and a limited ability to capture heterogeneous regions in remote sensing images effectively. To overcome these challenges, we propose Bimodal Bi-Adaptive Mask-Aware Convolution (Bi^2MAC), which effectively exploits information from different types of regions while intelligently allocating computational resources. Specifically, we design a lightweight module to generate both soft and hard masks, which are used to modulate the input features preliminarily and to guide different types of regions into separate processing branches, respectively. Redundant features are directed to a compact branch for low-cost global processing. In contrast, heterogeneous features are routed to a focused branch that invests more computational resources for fine-grained modeling. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Bi^2MAC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while requiring substantially lower training time and parameter counts, and the minimal computational cost among adaptive convolution models."

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent collaborative architectures have demonstrated remarkable potential for tackling complex tasks, offering a novel technological perspective for sensitive information detection. In response to these challenges, we propose Argus, a multi-agent collaborative framework for detecting sensitive information. Argus employs a three-tier detection mechanism that integrates key content, file context, and project reference relationships to effectively reduce false positives and enhance overall detection accuracy. To comprehensively evaluate Argus in real-world repository environments, we developed two new benchmarks, one to assess genuine leak detection capabilities and another to evaluate false-positive filtering performance. Experimental results show that Argus achieves up to 94.86% accuracy in leak detection, with a precision of 96.36%, recall of 94.64%, and an F1 score of 0.955.

Existing distribution-matching methods are confined to Euclidean spaces, making them only capture linear structures and overlook the intrinsic geometry of real data, e.g., curvature. However, high-dimensional data often lie on low-dimensional manifolds, suggesting that dataset distillation should have the distilled data manifold aligned with the original data manifold. In this work, we propose a geometry-aware distribution-matching framework, called \\textbf{GeoDM}, which operates in the Cartesian product of Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical manifolds, with flat, hierarchical, and cyclical structures all captured by a unified representation. To adapt to the underlying data geometry, we introduce learnable curvature and weight parameters for three kinds of geometries. At the same time, we design an optimal transport loss to enhance the distribution fidelity. Our theoretical analysis shows that the geometry-aware distribution matching in a product space yields a smaller generalization error bound than the Euclidean counterparts. Extensive experiments conducted on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art data distillation methods and remains effective across various distribution-matching strategies for the single geometries."

It has been observed in recent works that learning in a federated manner may lead the aggregated global model to converge to a 'sharp minimum' thereby adversely affecting the generalizability of this FL-trained model. Therefore, in this work, we aim to improve the generalization performance of models trained in a federated setup by introducing a 'flatness' constrained FL optimization problem. This flatness constraint is imposed on the top eigenvalue of the Hessian computed from the training loss. As each client trains a model on its local data, we further re-formulate this complex problem utilizing the client loss functions and propose a new computationally efficient regularization technique, dubbed 'MAN,' which Minimizes Activation's Norm of each layer on client-side models. We also theoretically show that minimizing the activation norm reduces the top eigenvalue of the layer-wise Hessian of the client's loss, which in turn decreases the overall Hessian's top eigenvalue, ensuring convergence to a flat minimum. We apply our proposed flatness-constrained optimization to the existing FL techniques and obtain significant improvements, thereby establishing new state-of-the-art."

    "abstract": "Experimental activities are an essential part of physics education. In addition to conveying scientific knowledge, they play a significant role in developing scientific literacy, inquiry skills, and critical thinking. In today's world, where students are exposed to vast amounts of information of varying quality, the ability to analyse, evaluate, and interpret information correctly has become increasingly important. This paper presents a series of physics experiments in the field of optics, specifically designed to foster critical thinking at various stages of the inquiry process. The topic of optics was chosen deliberately, as many optical phenomena occur naturally in everyday life, are familiar to students, and stimulate their curiosity. At the same time, they provide space for formulating hypotheses, designing experiments, interpreting data, and evaluating alternative explanations. Each experiment begins with a real-life problem situation that students are expected to explore and resolve through their own investigative work. The tasks are structured to encourage discussion, require argumentation, and promote reflection on both the process and the outcomes. The proposed experiments are suitable for students at both primary and secondary school levels and can be implemented in formal as well as non-formal educational settings. The aim of this contribution is to demonstrate how well-designed and pedagogically grounded experiments can not only enhance the understanding of physical concepts but also systematically develop critical thinking skills - one of the key competencies of 21st-century education."

Despite this widespread adoption, the principles that determine their performance remain underexplored, leaving practitioners to rely on heuristics rather than principled design choices. We address this gap by deriving quantitative scaling principles for agent systems. We evaluate this across four diverse benchmarks: Finance-Agent, BrowseComp-Plus, PlanCraft, and Workbench. Using five canonical architectures (Single, Independent, Centralized, Decentralized, Hybrid) instantiated across three LLM families, we perform a controlled evaluation spanning 180 configurations with standardized tools and token budgets. We derive a predictive model using empirical coordination metrics, including efficiency, overhead, error amplification, and redundancy, that achieves cross-validated R^2=0.513. We identify three dominant effects: (1) a tool-coordination trade-off: under fixed computational budgets, tool-heavy tasks suffer disproportionately from multi-agent overhead. (2) a capability saturation: coordination yields diminishing or negative returns (beta=-0.408, p<0.001) once single-agent baselines exceed ~45%. (3) topology-dependent error amplification: independent agents amplify errors 17.2x through unchecked propagation, while centralized coordination contains this to 4.4x. Centralized coordination improves performance by 80.9% on parallelizable tasks like financial reasoning, while decentralized coordination excels on dynamic web navigation (+9.2% vs. +0.2%). Yet for sequential reasoning tasks, all multi-agent variants degraded performance by 39-70%. The framework predicts the optimal coordination strategy for 87% of held-out configurations, providing a predictive principle of agentic scaling based on measurable task properties."

    "abstract": "Neural models for vulnerability prediction (VP) have achieved impressive performance by learning from large-scale code repositories. However, their susceptibility to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), where adversaries aim to infer whether a particular code sample was used during training, poses serious privacy concerns. While MIA has been widely investigated in NLP and vision domains, its effects on security-critical code analysis tasks remain underexplored. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of MIA on VP models, evaluating the attack success across various architectures (LSTM, BiGRU, and CodeBERT) and feature combinations, including embeddings, logits, loss, and confidence. Our threat model aligns with black-box and gray-box settings where prediction outputs are observable, allowing adversaries to infer membership by analyzing output discrepancies between training and non-training samples. The empirical findings reveal that logits and loss are the most informative and vulnerable outputs for membership leakage. Motivated by these observations, we propose a Noise-based Membership Inference Defense (NMID), which is a lightweight defense module that applies output masking and Gaussian noise injection to disrupt adversarial inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NMID significantly reduces MIA effectiveness, lowering the attack AUC from nearly 1.0 to below 0.65, while preserving the predictive utility of VP models. Our study highlights critical privacy risks in code analysis and offers actionable defense strategies for securing AI-powered software systems."

This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) aims to provide a comprehensive taxonomy of risks in the MCP ecosystem, distinguishing between adversarial security threats (e.g., indirect prompt injection, tool poisoning) and epistemic safety hazards (e.g., alignment failures in distributed tool delegation). We analyze the structural vulnerabilities of MCP primitives, specifically Resources, Prompts, and Tools, and demonstrate how \"context\" can be weaponized to trigger unauthorized operations in multi-agent environments. Furthermore, we survey state-of-the-art defenses, ranging from cryptographic provenance (ETDI) to runtime intent verification, and conclude with a roadmap for securing the transition from conversational chatbots to autonomous agentic operating systems."

Here, we use femtosecond optical pump-X-ray probe measurements to track the photoinduced electronic and structural dynamics in BiVO$_4$ across multiple length and time scales. Transient X-ray absorption spectroscopy captures sub-picosecond electron localization within VO$_4$ tetrahedra, consistent with small polaron formation, whereas time-resolved X-ray diffraction reveals a slower, multi-picosecond lattice reorganization into a hidden photoexcited state that is structurally distinct from both the monoclinic ground state and the high-temperature tetragonal phase. Supported by density functional theory, we show that hole-lattice interactions dynamically reduce the ground state monoclinic distortion, stabilizing the hidden state. Our results demonstrate that electron- and hole-lattice coupling jointly shape the excited state landscape, with implications for carrier transport, interfacial energetics, and light-to-chemical energy conversion pathways."

    "abstract": "We review recent advancements in understanding nucleon structure within the Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) framework--a fully relativistic, nonperturbative approach to solving quantum field theories. In its initial phase, we start with the leading Fock sector $|qqq\\rangle$ and an effective light-front Hamiltonian incorporating confinement and one-gluon exchange within which BLFQ can already successfully describe key nucleon observables. The framework has since been extended to include the next-to-leading Fock sector $|qqqg\\rangle$, enabling studies of gluonic contributions to the nucleon's internal structure, including gluon helicity, orbital angular momentum, and three-dimensional imaging through generalized and transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (GPDs and TMDs). Most recently, BLFQ has achieved a significant milestone by computing nucleon light-front wavefunctions as eigenstates of the QCD Hamiltonian without an explicit confining potential. These calculations, including Fock sectors up to $|qqqq\\bar{q}\\rangle$, further develop the path to first-principles predictions of quark and gluon matter densities, helicity and transversity distributions, and spin observables, showing qualitative agreement with experimental and phenomenological results. Together, these developments highlight BLFQ's growing capacity to provide an increasingly complete and realistic picture of nucleon structure grounded in QCD."

    "abstract": "We establish two new direct product theorems for the randomized query complexity of Boolean functions. The first shows that computing $n$ copies of a function $f$, even with a small success probability of $γ^n$, requires $Θ(n)$ times the \"maximum distributional\" query complexity of $f$ with success parameter $γ$. This result holds for all success parameters $γ$, even when $γ$ is very close to $1/2$ or to $1$. As a result, it unifies and generalizes Drucker's direct product theorem (2012) for $γ$ bounded away from $\\frac12$ and $1$ as well as the strong direct sum theorem of Blais and Brody (2019) for $γ\\approx 1-1/n$. The second establishes a general \"list decoding\" direct product theorem that captures many different variants of partial computation tasks related to the function $f^n$ consisting of $n$ copies of $f$. Notably, our list decoding direct product theorem yields a new threshold direct product theorem and other new variants such as the labelled-threshold direct product theorem. Both of these direct product theorems are obtained by taking a new approach. Instead of directly analyzing the query complexity of algorithms, we introduce a new measure of complexity of functions that we call \"discounted score\". We show that this measure satisfies a number of useful structural properties, including tensorization, that make it particularly suitable for the study of direct product questions."

Previous studies have overlooked such hybrid modes and the coupling in the study of resonant cyclotron instabilities in dusty magnetoplasmas. Using two-fluid models for positive ion beams and charged dust grains, nonthermal $κ$-density distributions for electrons and positive ions, and orbital motion limited (OML) models for dust-charge fluctuations, we derive a general linear dispersion relation for the coupled DLH and DC modes in the limit of when the hydrodynamic time scale is much longer than the dust-charging time scale. The hybrid mode propagates with a frequency lower than the typical dust-lower-hybrid frequency, $\\widetildeω_{\\rm{dl}}\\equivω_{\\rm{pd}}Ω_d/\\sqrt{ω^2_{\\rm{pd}}+Ω^2_d}$, where $ω_{\\rm{pd}}$ is the dust-plasma oscillation frequency and $Ω_d$ is the dust-cyclotron frequency. We obtain the growth rates of instabilities due to Cerenkov and cyclotron interactions and analyze them, taking into account the influences of the static magnetic field, ion-to-electron temperature ratio, electron-to-dust number density ratio, dust-charge fluctuation, and superthermal electrons and ions. We find that the maximum growth rates tend to increase but reach steady states as the wave number increases.

    "abstract": "Few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation (FS-3DSeg) aims to segment novel classes with only a few labeled samples. However, existing metric-based prototype learning methods generate prototypes solely from the support set, without considering their relevance to query data. This often results in prototype bias, where prototypes overfit support-specific characteristics and fail to generalize to the query distribution, especially in the presence of distribution shifts, which leads to degraded segmentation performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Query-aware Hub Prototype (QHP) learning method that explicitly models semantic correlations between support and query sets. Specifically, we propose a Hub Prototype Generation (HPG) module that constructs a bipartite graph connecting query and support points, identifies frequently linked support hubs, and generates query-relevant prototypes that better capture cross-set semantics. To further mitigate the influence of bad hubs and ambiguous prototypes near class boundaries, we introduce a Prototype Distribution Optimization (PDO) module, which employs a purity-reweighted contrastive loss to refine prototype representations by pulling bad hubs and outlier prototypes closer to their corresponding class centers. Extensive experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet demonstrate that QHP achieves substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, effectively narrowing the semantic gap between prototypes and query sets in FS-3DSeg."

Subsequently, we assume that the interactions among the study units are governed either by (i) a dense graph or (ii) an i.i.d. Gaussian matrix. In each case, we show that the treatment effects have well-defined limits as the population size diverges to infinity. Additionally, we develop polynomial time algorithms to consistently evaluate the treatment effects in each case. Finally, we estimate the unknown parameters from the observed data using maximum pseudo-likelihood estimates, and establish the stability of our causal effect estimators under this perturbation. Our algorithms provably approximate the causal effects in polynomial time even in low-temperature regimes where the canonical MCMC samplers are slow mixing. For dense graphs, our results use the notion of regularity partitions; for Gaussian interactions, our approach uses ideas from spin glass theory and Approximate Message Passing."

    "abstract": "The increasing data rate has become a major issue confronting next-generation intracortical brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs). The scaling number of recording sites requires complex analog wiring and lead to huge digitization power consumption. Compressive event-based neural frontends have been used in high-density neural implants to support the simultaneous recording of more channels. Event-based frontends (EBF) convert recorded signals into asynchronous digital events via delta modulation and can inherently achieve considerable compression. But EBFs are prone to false events that do not correspond to neural spikes. Spike detection (SPD) is a key process in the iBMI pipeline to detect neural spikes and further reduce the data rate. However, conventional digital SPD suffers from the increasing buffer size and frequent memory access power, and conventional spike emphasizers are not compatible with EBFs. In this work we introduced an event-based spike detection (Ev-SPD) algorithm for scalable compressive EBFs. To implement the algorithm effectively, we proposed a novel low-power 10-T eDRAM-SRAM hybrid random-access memory in-memory computing bitcell for event processing. We fabricated the proposed 1024-channel IMC SPD macro in a 65nm process and tested the macro with both synthetic dataset and Neuropixel recordings. The proposed macro achieved a high spike detection accuracy of 96.06% on a synthetic dataset and 95.08% similarity and 0.05 firing pattern MAE on Neuropixel recordings. Our event-based IMC SPD macro achieved a high per channel spike detection energy efficiency of 23.9 nW per channel and an area efficiency of 375 um^2 per channel.

Traditional approaches face a trade-off: continuous compression dilutes high-level semantics such as object identities, while discrete quantization loses fine-grained details such as textures. We introduce HTC-VLM, a hybrid framework that disentangles semantics and appearance through dual channels, i.e., a continuous pathway for fine-grained details via ViT patches and a discrete pathway for symbolic anchors using MGVQ quantization projected to four tokens. These are fused into a 580-token hybrid sequence and compressed into a single voco token via a disentanglement attention mask and bottleneck, ensuring efficient and grounded representations. HTC-VLM achieves an average performance retention of 87.2 percent across seven benchmarks (GQA, VQAv2, MMBench, MME, POPE, SEED-Bench, ScienceQA-Image), outperforming the leading continuous baseline at 81.0 percent with a 580-to-1 compression ratio. Attention analyses show that the compressed token prioritizes the discrete anchor, validating its semantic guidance. Our work demonstrates that a minimalist hybrid design can resolve the efficiency-fidelity dilemma and advance scalable VLMs."

Classical metrics such as PESQ and POLQA approximate human mean opinion scores (MOS) but require carefully controlled conditions and expensive listening tests, while learning-based models such as NISQA regress MOS and multiple perceptual dimensions from waveforms or spectrograms, achieving high correlation with subjective ratings yet remaining rigid: they do not support interactive, natural-language queries and do not natively provide textual rationales. In this work, we introduce SpeechQualityLLM, a multimodal speech quality question-answering (QA) system that couples an audio encoder with a language model and is trained on the NISQA corpus using template-based question-answer pairs covering overall MOS and four perceptual dimensions (noisiness, coloration, discontinuity, and loudness) in both single-ended (degraded only) and double-ended (degraded plus clean reference) setups. Instead of directly regressing scores, our system is supervised to generate textual answers from which numeric predictions are parsed and evaluated with standard regression and ranking metrics; on held-out NISQA clips, the double-ended model attains a MOS mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41 with Pearson correlation of 0.86, with competitive performance on dimension-wise tasks. Beyond these quantitative gains, it offers a flexible natural-language interface in which the language model acts as an audio quality expert: practitioners can query arbitrary aspects of degradations, prompt the model to emulate different listener profiles to capture human variability and produce diverse but plausible judgments rather than a single deterministic score, and thereby reduce reliance on large-scale crowdsourced tests and their monetary cost."

    "abstract": "The advancement of camera-only Bird's-Eye-View(BEV) perception is currently impeded by a fundamental tension between state-of-the-art performance and on-vehicle deployment tractability. This bottleneck stems from a deep-rooted dependency on computationally prohibitive view transformations and bespoke, platform-specific kernels. This paper introduces FastBEV++, a framework engineered to reconcile this tension, demonstrating that high performance and deployment efficiency can be achieved in unison via two guiding principles: Fast by Algorithm and Deployable by Design. We realize the \"Deployable by Design\" principle through a novel view transformation paradigm that decomposes the monolithic projection into a standard Index-Gather-Reshape pipeline. Enabled by a deterministic pre-sorting strategy, this transformation is executed entirely with elementary, operator native primitives (e.g Gather, Matrix Multiplication), which eliminates the need for specialized CUDA kernels and ensures fully TensorRT-native portability. Concurrently, our framework is \"Fast by Algorithm\", leveraging this decomposed structure to seamlessly integrate an end-to-end, depth-aware fusion mechanism. This jointly learned depth modulation, further bolstered by temporal aggregation and robust data augmentation, significantly enhances the geometric fidelity of the BEV representation.Empirical validation on the nuScenes benchmark corroborates the efficacy of our approach. FastBEV++ establishes a new state-of-the-art 0.359 NDS while maintaining exceptional real-time performance, exceeding 134 FPS on automotive-grade hardware (e.g Tesla T4). By offering a solution that is free of custom plugins yet highly accurate, FastBEV++ presents a mature and scalable design philosophy for production autonomous systems.

The estimator is boundary-aware and mitigates the boundary bias suffered by conventional KDEs, while remaining simple to implement. Its mean squared error, uniform strong consistency on expanding compact sets, and asymptotic normality are established under the Lebesgue measure and suitable mixing conditions. This work represents the first study of density estimation on this space under any metric. For independent observations, an asymptotic upper bound on the mean absolute error is also derived. A simulation study compares the performance of the Wishart KDE to another boundary-aware KDE that relies on the matrix-variate lognormal distribution proposed by Schwartzman [Int. Stat. Rev., 2016, 84(3), 456-486]. Results suggest that the Wishart KDE is superior for a selection of autoregressive coefficient matrices and innovation covariance matrices when estimating the stationary marginal density of a Wishart autoregressive process. To illustrate the practical utility of the Wishart KDE, an application to finance is made by estimating the marginal density function of a time series of realized covariance matrices, calculated from 5-minute intra-day returns, between the share prices of Amazon Corp. and the Standard & Poor's 500 exchange-traded fund over a one-year period.

However, in split inference systems-where intermediate features from neural network are transmitted instead of pixel data-these assumptions no longer apply. Intermediate features are abstract, sparse, and task-specific, making perceptual fidelity irrelevant. In this paper, we investigate the use of Versatile Video Coding (VVC) for compressing such features under the MPEG-AI Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard. We perform a tool-level analysis to understand the impact of individual coding components on compression efficiency and downstream vision task accuracy. Based on these insights, we propose three lightweight essential VVC profiles-Fast, Faster, and Fastest. The Fast profile provides 2.96% BD-Rate gain while reducing encoding time by 21.8%. Faster achieves a 1.85% BD-Rate gain with a 51.5% speedup. Fastest reduces encoding time by 95.6% with only a 1.71% loss in BD-Rate."

    "abstract": "Scalability remains a major challenge in building practical fault-tolerant quantum computers. Currently, the largest number of qubits achieved across leading quantum platforms ranges from hundreds to thousands. In atom arrays, scalability is primarily constrained by the capacity to generate large numbers of optical tweezers, and conventional techniques using acousto-optic deflectors or spatial light modulators struggle to produce arrays much beyond $\\sim 10,000$ tweezers. Moreover, these methods require additional microscope objectives to focus the light into micrometer-sized spots, which further complicates system integration and scalability. Here, we demonstrate the experimental generation of an optical tweezer array containing $280\\times 280$ spots using a metasurface, nearly an order of magnitude more than most existing systems. The metasurface leverages a large number of subwavelength phase-control pixels to engineer the wavefront of the incident light, enabling both large-scale tweezer generation and direct focusing into micron-scale spots without the need for a microscope. This result shifts the scalability bottleneck for atom arrays from the tweezer generation hardware to the available laser power. Furthermore, the array shows excellent intensity uniformity exceeding $90\\%$, making it suitable for homogeneous single-atom loading and paving the way for trapping arrays of more than $10,000$ atoms in the near future."

Current approaches typically yield either geometrically inconsistent multi-view images or sacrifice photorealism, resulting in blurry outputs under diverse viewing angles and complex motions. To address these issues, we propose Blur2Sharp, a novel framework integrating 3D-aware neural rendering and diffusion models to generate sharp, geometrically consistent novel-view images from only a single reference view. Our method employs a dual-conditioning architecture: initially, a Human NeRF model generates geometrically coherent multi-view renderings for target poses, explicitly encoding 3D structural guidance. Subsequently, a diffusion model conditioned on these renderings refines the generated images, preserving fine-grained details and structural fidelity. We further enhance visual quality through hierarchical feature fusion, incorporating texture, normal, and semantic priors extracted from parametric SMPL models to simultaneously improve global coherence and local detail accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Blur2Sharp consistently surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in both novel pose and view generation tasks, particularly excelling under challenging scenarios involving loose clothing and occlusions."

The exact mechanisms that lead to disk formation and dissipation are not fully known although progress has been made with some systems. Here, we present a study of a disk outburst of the southern Be star λ Pavonis (HD 173948). Our dataset comprises 698 high-resolution spectra taken contemporaneously with TESS photometry in 2023. During the final days of TESS monitoring, the star began building a disk from a pristine diskless state. We find that the disk built within 5 days in optical H I and He I lines, while the disk is circularized in about 12 days. The disk began to decay in higher energy He I first, then lower energy transitions, with the decay ending last for Hα. We examine non-radial pulsations both through TESS photometry and the line profile variations in Balmer lines, He I lines, and the weak photospheric Si III 5739 line. Our analysis indicates that two periodicities seen in TESS photometry (at 1.644 and 1.485 cycles/d) are not seen in the spectral lines before, during, or after the outburst. The strongest spectral signal is a periodicity at 0.163 cycles/d, which appears as a difference between the weaker signals. We additionally find evidence for fast non-photometric pulsational variations over the course of spectroscopy obtained before, during, and after the outburst. These fast LPVs are strong, and interfere with the two weaker signals, causing their apparent incoherence."

Yet, conventional passive systems require prior knowledge of non-cooperative source waveforms, are vulnerable to strong interference, and rely on Doppler signatures, limiting their ability to detect subtle or slow-moving targets. Here, we introduce a metasurface-enabled PR (MEPR) concept that integrates a space-time-coding programmable metasurface to imprint distinct spatiotemporal tags onto ambient wireless wavefields. This mechanism transforms a PR into an active-like sensing platform without the need for source control, enabling interference suppression, signal enhancement, and accurate target localization and tracking in cluttered environments. A proof-of-concept implementation operating at 5.48 GHz confirms real-time imaging and tracking of unmanned aerial vehicles under interference-rich conditions, with performance comparable to active radar systems. These results establish MEPR as a solid foundation for scalable, adaptive, and energy-efficient next-generation integrated sensing and communication systems."

While video-generation models are increasingly adopted, they often lack rigorous physical grounding, leading to hallucinations and a failure to maintain consistency in long-horizon physical constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Embodied Tree of Thoughts (EToT), a novel Real2Sim2Real planning framework that leverages a physics-based interactive digital twin as an embodied world model. EToT formulates manipulation planning as a tree search expanded through two synergistic mechanisms: (1) Priori Branching, which generates diverse candidate execution paths based on semantic and spatial analysis; and (2) Reflective Branching, which utilizes VLMs to diagnose execution failures within the simulator and iteratively refine the planning tree with corrective actions. By grounding high-level reasoning in a physics simulator, our framework ensures that generated plans adhere to rigid-body dynamics and collision constraints. We validate EToT on a suite of short- and long-horizon manipulation tasks, where it consistently outperforms baselines by effectively predicting physical dynamics and adapting to potential failures.

We propose a practical, fully reproducible framework for evaluating medical AI security under realistic resource constraints. Our framework design covers multiple medical specialties stratified by clinical risk -- from high-risk domains such as emergency medicine and psychiatry to general practice -- addressing jailbreaking attacks (role-playing, authority impersonation, multi-turn manipulation) and privacy extraction attacks. All evaluation utilizes synthetic patient records requiring no IRB approval. The framework is designed to run entirely on consumer CPU hardware using freely available models, eliminating cost barriers. We present the framework specification including threat models, data generation methodology, evaluation protocols, and scoring rubrics. This proposal establishes a foundation for comparative security assessment of medical-specialist models and defense mechanisms, advancing the broader goal of ensuring safe and trustworthy medical AI systems."

GEL estimates the $n\\ (\\ll N)$ weights by maximizing the empirical likelihood ratio. The dimensionality of the optimization problem is thus reduced from $N$ to $n$, thereby lowering the computational complexity. We prove that GEL possesses the same first order asymptotic properties as the conventional empirical likelihood method under the estimating equation settings and the classical two-sample mean problem. A distributed GEL method is also proposed with several servers. Numerical simulations and real data analysis demonstrate that GEL can keep the same inferential accuracy as the conventional empirical likelihood method, and achieves substantial computational acceleration compared to the divide-and-conquer empirical likelihood method. We can analyze a billion data with GEL in tens of seconds on only one PC."

GeoLoom comprises two core components: an autoformalization module that translates natural language into a specifically designed generation-oriented formal language GeoLingua, and a coordinate solver that maps formal constraints to precise coordinates using the efficient Monte Carlo optimization. To support this framework, we introduce GeoNF, a dataset aligning natural language geometric descriptions with formal GeoLingua descriptions. We further propose a constraint-based evaluation metric that quantifies structural deviation, offering mathematically grounded supervision for iterative refinement. Empirical results demonstrate that GeoLoom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in structural fidelity, providing a principled foundation for interpretable and scalable diagram generation."

We develop a generative modeling framework for worst-case generation for a pre-specified risk, based on min-max optimization over continuous probability distributions, namely the Wasserstein space. Unlike traditional discrete distributionally robust optimization approaches, which often suffer from scalability issues, limited generalization, and costly worst-case inference, our framework exploits the Brenier theorem to characterize the least favorable (worst-case) distribution as the pushforward of a transport map from a continuous reference measure, enabling a continuous and expressive notion of risk-induced generation beyond classical discrete DRO formulations. Based on the min-max formulation, we propose a Gradient Descent Ascent (GDA)-type scheme that updates the decision model and the transport map in a single loop, establishing global convergence guarantees under mild regularity assumptions and possibly without convexity-concavity. We also propose to parameterize the transport map using a neural network that can be trained simultaneously with the GDA iterations by matching the transported training samples, thereby achieving a simulation-free approach. The efficiency of the proposed method as a risk-induced worst-case generator is validated by numerical experiments on synthetic and image data."

As the number of qubits increases, the probability density sharply concentrates around the maximally mixed state, making nearly pure coarse-grained states increasingly unlikely. For two qubits, we also compute the inverse state needed to characterize the effective dynamics under coarse-graining and find that the average preimage of the maximally mixed state contains a finite singlet component.

    "abstract": "An important aspect of the performance of algorithms that predict individualized treatment effects (ITE) is moderate calibration, i.e., the average treatment effect among individuals with predicted treatment effect of z being equal to z. The assessment of moderate calibration is a challenging task on two fronts: counterfactual responses are unobserved, and quantifying the conditional response function for models that generate continuous predicted values requires regularization or parametric modeling. Perhaps because of these challenges, there is currently no inferential method for the null hypothesis that an ITE model is moderately calibrated in a population. In this work, we propose non-parametric methods for the assessment of moderate calibration of ITE models for binary outcomes using data from a randomized trial. These methods simultaneously resolve both challenges, resulting in novel numerical, graphical, and inferential methods for the assessment of moderate calibration. The key idea is to formulate a stochastic process for the cumulative prediction errors that obeys a functional central limit theorem, enabling the use of the properties of Brownian motion for asymptotic inference. We propose two approaches to construct this process from a sample: a conditional approach that relies on predicted risks (often an output of ITE models), and a marginal approach based on replacing the cumulative conditional expected value and variance terms with their marginal counterparts. Numerical simulations confirm the desirable properties of both approaches and their ability to detect miscalibration of different forms. We use a case study to provide practical suggestions on graphical presentation and the interpretation of results. Moderate calibration of predicted ITEs can be assessed without requiring regularization techniques or making assumptions about the functional form of treatment response."

In lieu of this, we ask instead which actions are played more often in the long run, and by how much. We show that, in strongly monotone games, the dynamics of regularized learning may wander away from equilibrium infinitely often, but they always return to its vicinity in finite time (which we estimate), and their long-run distribution is sharply concentrated around a neighborhood thereof. We quantify the degree of this concentration, and we show that these favorable properties may all break down if the underlying game is not strongly monotone -- underscoring in this way the limits of regularized learning in the presence of persistent randomness and uncertainty."

    "abstract": "Micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS) thermal flow sensors are increasingly used for compact, low-power flow monitoring in biomedical applications. However, silicon-based method for sensor fabrication is limited by high cost, rigidity, and multi-step cleanroom processes. This study presents a single-step fiber laser micromachining method for fabricating biocompatible, free-standing MEMS thermal flow sensors from ultrathin titanium foil. The process combines patterning and localized thinning in single-step process, with titanium serving as resistive sensing element. A dual-matrix optimization approach consisting of a Threshold Mapping Matrix (TMM) and Energy Density Matrix (EDM) was used to determine optimized parameters without repeated trial-and-error. For localized thinning, sequential R-T scans with cooling intervals reduced redeposition from the Gaussian beam profile and produced uniform thickness reduction from 50 μm to 20--30 μm. The fabricated sensors were evaluated through thermal coefficient resistance (TCR) measurement, Infrared (IR) thermography, and airflow tests under steady and cyclic conditions controlled by artificial ventilation system. The fabricated devices showed a stable TCR of 3278 ppm °C$^{-1}$, a linear relationship calibration curve between velocity and resistance with $R^2$=0.986 and a 54% improvement in thermal response was achieved with the free-standing structure design compared to substrate-fixed designs. This fabrication approach removes the need for photolithography, wet/dry etching, and wafer bonding, enabling faster and lower-cost production of flexible, biocompatible flow sensors. The method can be applied to other MEMS devices that require compact size, flexibility, localized thinning and free-standing structures."

In clinical research, AI supports automated adverse event detection in clinical trials, patient eligibility screening for protocol enrollment, and data quality validation. Beyond healthcare, AI is transforming finance through real-time fraud detection, automated loan risk assessment, and algorithmic decision-making. Similarly, in manufacturing, AI enables predictive maintenance to reduce equipment downtime, enhances quality control through computer-vision inspection, and optimizes production workflows using real-time operational data. While these technologies enhance operational efficiency, they introduce new challenges regarding safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. To address these concerns, we introduce the SMART+ Framework - a structured model built on the pillars of Safety, Monitoring, Accountability, Reliability, and Transparency, and further enhanced with Privacy & Security, Data Governance, Fairness & Bias, and Guardrails. SMART+ offers a practical, comprehensive approach to evaluating and governing AI systems across industries. This framework aligns with evolving mechanisms and regulatory guidance to integrate operational safeguards, oversight procedures, and strengthened privacy and governance controls. SMART+ demonstrates risk mitigation, trust-building, and compliance readiness. By enabling responsible AI adoption and ensuring auditability, SMART+ provides a robust foundation for effective AI governance in clinical research."

Existing methods have improved robustness but typically rely on fixed or batch-level thresholds, which cannot account for varying difficulty across classes and instances. This limitation is especially problematic in semantic segmentation, where each image requires dense, multi-class predictions. We propose an approach that adaptively adjusts pseudo labels to reflect the confidence distribution within each image and dynamically balances learning toward classes most affected by domain shifts. This fine-grained, class- and instance-aware adaptation produces more reliable supervision and mitigates error accumulation throughout continual adaptation. Extensive experiments across eight CTTA and TTA scenarios, including synthetic-to-real and long-term shifts, show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, setting a new standard for semantic segmentation under evolving conditions."

    "abstract": "Traditionally, multithreaded data structures have been designed for access by the threads of Operating Systems (OS). However, implementations for access by programmable alternatives known as lightweight threads (also referred to as asynchronous calls or coroutines) have not been thoroughly studied. The main advantage of lightweight threads is their significantly lower overhead during launch and context switching. However, this comes at a cost: to achieve proper parallelism, context switches must be manually invoked in the code; without these switches, new lightweight threads will never be executed. In this paper, we focus on the simplest multithreaded data structure: a mutex (also known as a lock). We demonstrate that original implementations for OS threads cannot be used effectively in this new context due to the potential for deadlocks. Furthermore, correctness is not the only concern. In certain languages, such as C++, there are various lightweight thread libraries, each with different implementations and interfaces, which necessitate distinct lock implementations. In this work, we present a modification of TTAS and MCS locks for the use from lightweight threads and demonstrate that the two context switch mechanisms of lightweight threads, yielding and sleeping, are crucial. However, the performance of TTAS and MCS may differ significantly depending on the settings. If one wants to have a lock that works well for any library, we suggest using the cohort lock, which strikes a balance between MCS and TTAS by utilizing several MCS queues with a common TTAS."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "This paper contains an encouraging result for the development of the Exotic Model (the `XM'). The XM is made from the Supersymmetric Standard Model (the `SSM') by coupling it to the `Exotic Invariant'. This rather unique `Exotic Invariant' is suggested by the detailed form of the SSM, combined with the detailed form of the BRS cohomology of SUSY. The motivation for examining the XM is that the usual SSM has some well-known, and serious, problems in its generally accepted, but unsatisfactory, SUSY breaking mechanism. That mechanism is based on the spontaneous breaking of SUSY. The Exotic Model avoids all of these problems, easily, because its SUSY splitting mechanism does not use, or need, any kind of spontaneous breaking of SUSY. The XM contains a mechanism for SUSY mass splitting because the addition of the Exotic Invariant modifies the algebra of SUSY. This paper is E8 in a series of papers denoted En, n= 1,2, ... all devoted to the XM. There is a lot of work still required to elucidate how the XM functions, and to see if the XM is really a viable alternative to the SSM. The first crucial question, raised in E7, is whether it is possible to constrain the initial XM action, so that the result excludes tachyonic excitations at tree level. If the XM is to be a viable theory, it is essential to first remove the tachyonic excitations, in a sensible way, from the fermionic and the bosonic sectors of the quadratic ZX action. This paper E8 explains how to remove the tachyons from the basic fermionic `ZX sector' at tree level. There are four fermion fields in this ZX sector. The removal requires that all of these fields have the same mass. This result is shown using a Mathematica notebook, which is issued with this paper."

We show which of these inequalities define facets and exhibit a superset of the facet-defining ones that can be enumerated in polynomial time. We show that for some graphs, the latter superset contains redundant inequalities. As corollaries, we obtain that the problems of finding an induced tree or path maximizing a linear function over the edges and vertices are solvable in polynomial time for the class of chordal graphs ."

However, a critical challenge arises from severe distribution shifts between robotic action data, primarily due to substantial numerical variations in action commands across diverse robotic platforms and tasks, hindering the effective transfer of pretrained knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose a semantically grounded linguistic representation to normalize actions for efficient pretraining. Unlike conventional discretized action representations that are sensitive to numerical scales, the motion representation specifically disregards numeric scale effects, emphasizing directionality instead. This abstraction mitigates distribution shifts, yielding a more generalizable pretraining representation. Moreover, using the motion representation narrows the feature distance between action tokens and standard vocabulary tokens, mitigating modality gaps. Multi-task experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves generalization performance and transferability in robotic manipulation tasks."

    "abstract": "We consider a behavioral-feedback SIR epidemic model, in which the infection rate depends in feedback on the fractions of susceptible and infected agents, respectively. The considered model allows one to account for endogenous adaptation mechanisms of the agents in response to the epidemics, such as voluntary social distancing, or the adoption of face masks. For this model, we formulate an optimal control problem for a social planner that has the ability to reduce the infection rate to keep the infection curve below a certain threshold within an infinite time horizon, while minimizing the intervention cost. Based on the dynamic properties of the model, we prove that, under quite general conditions on the infection rate, the \\emph{filling the box} strategy is the optimal control. This strategy consists in letting the epidemics spread without intervention until the threshold is reached, then applying the minimum control that leaves the fraction of infected individuals constantly at the threshold until the reproduction number becomes less than one and the infection naturally fades out. Our result generalizes one available in the literature for the equivalent problem formulated for the classical SIR model, which can be recovered as a special case of our model when the infection rate is constant. Our contribution enhances the understanding of epidemic management with adaptive human behavior, offering insights for robust containment strategies."

A key obstacle lies in the lack of diverse and high-quality real-world 3D assets with rich texture details, since capturing such data is intrinsically difficult due to the diverse scales of scenes, non-rigid motions of objects, and the limited precision of 3D scanners. We introduce Photo3D, a framework for advancing photorealistic 3D generation, which is driven by the image data generated by the GPT-4o-Image model. Considering that the generated images can distort 3D structures due to their lack of multi-view consistency, we design a structure-aligned multi-view synthesis pipeline and construct a detail-enhanced multi-view dataset paired with 3D geometry. Building on it, we present a realistic detail enhancement scheme that leverages perceptual feature adaptation and semantic structure matching to enforce appearance consistency with realistic details while preserving the structural consistency with the 3D-native geometry. Our scheme is general to different 3D-native generators, and we present dedicated training strategies to facilitate the optimization of geometry-texture coupled and decoupled 3D-native generation paradigms. Experiments demonstrate that Photo3D generalizes well across diverse 3D-native generation paradigms and achieves state-of-the-art photorealistic 3D generation performance."

    "abstract": "The nominal habitable zone for exoplanets orbiting M dwarfs lies close to the host star, making dynamical considerations especially important. One consequence of this proximity is the expectation of spin synchronization, with implications for atmospheric circulation. Several mechanisms can maintain non-zero obliquities over long timescales in compact multi-planet systems, including capture into Cassini State 2 (CS2) and other forms of secular spin-orbit coupling; such pathways are plausible in the orbital architectures of close-in M-dwarf planets. In this study, we search for transit duration variations (TDVs) consistent with the nodal precession rates predicted by Laplace-Lagrange secular theory in compact M-dwarf multi-planet systems. Our sample includes 23 exoplanets orbiting 12 stars. We compare recent, high-precision transit durations obtained from JWST white-light curves with measurements published at the discovery epoch and afterward. The resulting transit duration variation ranges from seconds to minutes, and we fit a linear trend to duration versus time for each planet. All systems are consistent with flat (no TDV) at the 3σ level. The strongest candidate is TRAPPIST-1d, whose fitted slope differs from zero with 2.2σ confidence. We calculate the expected TDV signals predicted by secular precession and compare them to the observed limits. Our null detection is consistent with the low-impact-parameter regime, where theoretical TDVs are only a few seconds per decade and below our sensitivity. Higher-impact-parameter configurations predict substantially larger TDVs and are disfavored: under uniformly distributed geometries, at least half of the allowed configurations would be excluded."

However, an evolving circumterrestrial environment may limit their applicability, particularly when models are trained on outdated debris representations. In this work, we devise a computational pipeline using synthetic fragmentation data from explosive breakup events, generated via a Standard Breakup Model and propagated under a high-fidelity dynamical model. Proper elements are extracted using adapted algorithms for modified equinoctial (MEE), Poincar'e (PNC), and quaternion (QTN) sets. Extending beyond previous approaches limited to MEE space, we include PNC and QTN sets to broaden the dynamical fingerprints available to the classifier. Neural networks trained on various element combinations are used to determine if fragment pairs share a parent. Crucially, we identify a fundamental limitation when applying standard quaternion sets to neural networks: the loss of orbital size information during feature normalization. We introduce an augmented representation (QTN$_p$) that explicitly restores the semi-latus rectum, improving accuracy from 0.31 to 0.60 compared to the standard set. In synthetic Starlink-like LEO experiments, expanding proper-element sets generally improves discrimination. The best model, using a joint feature set (MEE + PNC + QTN), achieves an ROC-AUC of 0.858 compared to 0.789 for the MEE-only baseline, alongside higher accuracy and F1 scores."

Combining the NIRSpec dataset with available optical and far-infrared constraints from MIRI and ALMA, we show that the emission spectrum of GHZ2 cannot be reproduced by single-density spectro-photometric models. Multi-zone photoionisation modelling performed with the HOMERUN code demonstrates that star formation must be occurring in a strongly stratified ISM, where both low-/intermediate-density gas and high-density regions (log($n_e$/cm$^{-3}) \\gtrsim 4$) coexist. The GHZ2 emission landscape is consistent with either a composite star-formation plus AGN scenario, or with star formation occurring in a combination of radiation- and matter-bounded regions. Purely radiation-bounded stellar models fail to reproduce the observed He II emission, making an additional hard ionising component unavoidable."

Our results show that LSTE and FSTE yield nearly identical exchange parameters, whereas the LKAG method reproduces the dominant exchange interactions but exhibits quantitative deviations. A detailed analysis of computational efficiency versus accuracy reveals that the LSTE scheme offers the most favorable balance, establishing a general, reproducible, and scalable workflow for Heisenberg mapping, while the FSTE approach remains the most straightforward for extracting specific exchange interactions."

    "abstract": "We report the synthesis of bell-shaped Bi/Bi13S18Br2 metal/semiconductor heterostructures as a photocatalyst based on non-toxic and Earth-abundant elements. Their unique morphology arises from a multi-step growth process, involving 1) the nucleation of Bi13S18Br2 nanorods, 2) the reduction of a metallic-Bi domain on their surface induced by N,N-didodecylmethylamine, and 3) the heterostructure accretion by a localized reaction at the Bi/Bi13S18Br2 interface promoted by Ostwald ripening. These heterostructures display remarkable stability in polar solvents, remaining almost unaffected by prolonged exposure to isopropanol and water, and exhibit high photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of organic dyes (i.e., Rhodamine-B and Methylene Blue) under visible-light irradiation, with good recyclability. Additionally, preliminary tests demonstrate CO2 reduction capabilities, which make them promising for both the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants and photo-electro CO2 conversion. The straightforward synthesis process and the use of non-toxic and earth-abundant elements offers significant potential for sustainable energy conversion technologies."

    "abstract": "Modern power networks face increasing vulnerability to cascading failures due to high complexity and the growing penetration of intermittent resources, necessitating rigorous security assessment beyond the conventional $N-1$ criterion. Current approaches often struggle to achieve the computational tractability required for exhaustive $N-2$ contingency analysis integrated with complex stability evaluations like small-signal stability. Addressing this computational bottleneck and the limitations of deterministic screening, this paper presents a scalable methodology for the vulnerability assessment of modern power networks, integrating $N-2$ contingency analysis with small-signal stability evaluation. To prioritize critical components, we propose a probabilistic \\textbf{Risk Index ($R_i$)} that weights the deterministic \\textit{severity} of a contingency (including optimal power flow divergence, islanding, and oscillatory instability) by the \\textit{failure frequency} of the involved elements based on reliability data. The proposed framework is implemented using High-Performance Computing (HPC) techniques through the PyCOMPSs parallel programming library, orchestrating optimal power flow simulations (VeraGrid) and small-signal analysis (STAMP) to enable the exhaustive exploration of massive contingency sets. The methodology is validated on the IEEE 118-bus test system, processing more than \\num{57000} scenarios to identify components prone to triggering cascading failures. Results demonstrate that the risk-based approach effectively isolates critical assets that deterministic $N-1$ criteria often overlook. This work establishes a replicable and efficient workflow for probabilistic security assessment, suitable for large-scale networks and capable of supporting operator decision-making in near real-time environments."

    "abstract": "While the importance of human factors in agile software development is widely acknowledged, the measurement of an individual's \"agile agreement\" remains an ill-defined and challenging area. A key limitation in existing research is the failure to distinguish between agreement with the abstract, high-level values of the Agile Manifesto and agreement with the concrete, day-to-day practices derived from the 12 Principles. This paper addresses this methodological gap by presenting the design and validation of two distinct instruments: the novel Manifesto Agreement Scale (MAS), and the Principle Agreement Scale (PAS), which is a systematic adaptation and refinement of a prior instrument. We detail the systematic process of item creation and selection, survey design, and validation. The results demonstrate that both scales possess important internal consistency and construct validity. A convergence and divergence analysis, including Proportional Odds Logistic Regression, a Bland-Altman plot, and an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), reveals that while the two scales are moderately correlated, they are not interchangeable and capture distinct dimensions of agile agreement. The primary contribution of this work is a pair of publicly available instruments, validated within a specific demographic of Belgian IT professionals. These scales represent a critical initial step toward facilitating a more nuanced measurement of agile agreement, distinguishing agile agreement across various levels of perception and aiding in a more refined interpretation of person-agile fit."

    "abstract": "Entangled states of photons form the foundation of quantum communication, computation, and metrology. Yet their generation remains fundamentally constrained: in the absence of intrinsic photon-photon interactions, the generation of such states is inherently probabilistic rather than deterministic. The prevalent technique of post-selection verifies the creation of an entangled state by detecting and thus destroying it. Heralding offers a solution in which measuring ancillary photons in auxiliary modes signals the state generation without the need to measure it. Here, we report an experiment to generate a three-mode two-photon NOON state, where the detection of a single photon in one heralding mode signifies the presence of the state in three target modes. We validate the generated state by estimating a fidelity of 0.823 +/- 0.018 with respect to an ideal three-mode NOON state and certifying genuine multipartite entanglement. By virtue of the high success probability and small resource overhead of our scheme, our work provides a theoretical and experimental stepping stone for entangled multi-mode state generation, which is realizable with current technology. These multi-mode entangled states represent a key direction for linear optical quantum information that is complementary to multi-qubit state encoding."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the Impact-Driven AI Framework (IDAIF), a novel architectural methodology that integrates Theory of Change (ToC) principles with modern artificial intelligence system design. As AI systems increasingly influence high-stakes domains including healthcare, finance, and public policy, the alignment problem--ensuring AI behavior corresponds with human values and intentions--has become critical. Current approaches predominantly optimize technical performance metrics while neglecting the sociotechnical dimensions of AI deployment. IDAIF addresses this gap by establishing a systematic mapping between ToC's five-stage model (Inputs-Activities-Outputs-Outcomes-Impact) and corresponding AI architectural layers (Data Layer-Pipeline Layer-Inference Layer-Agentic Layer-Normative Layer). Each layer incorporates rigorous theoretical foundations: multi-objective Pareto optimization for value alignment, hierarchical multi-agent orchestration for outcome achievement, causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for hallucination mitigation, and adversarial debiasing with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for fairness assurance. We provide formal mathematical formulations for each component and introduce an Assurance Layer that manages assumption failures through guardian architectures. Three case studies demonstrate IDAIF application across healthcare, cybersecurity, and software engineering domains. This framework represents a paradigm shift from model-centric to impact-centric AI development, providing engineers with concrete architectural patterns for building ethical, trustworthy, and socially beneficial AI systems."

Among the most successful approaches are learned iterative networks, which are formulated by unrolling classical iterative optimisation algorithms for solving variational problems.

In this chapter we present a unified operator view for learned iterative networks. Specifically, we formulate a learned reconstruction operator, defining how to compute, and separately the learning problem, which defines what to compute. In this setting we present common approaches and show that many approaches are closely related in their core. We review linear as well as nonlinear inverse problems in this framework and present a short numerical study to conclude."

All elements were integrated into a drive-laser beamline of an electron RF-photoinjector, enabling direct evaluation under accelerator-relevant conditions. The SPP produced a high-purity Laguerre-Gaussian mode with OAM l = 64 and a measured conversion efficiency of approximately 80\\%. Binary axicons generated quasi-Bessel twisted light with topological charges up to m = 10, exhibiting low divergence and stable multi-lobe ring structures. The fork grating reliably produced lower-order modes, l = 2-8, with good agreement between simulations and cylindrical-lens diagnostics. These results constitute, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive experimental demonstration of deep-UV high-OAM beams generated with fabricated DOEs and validated through mode-conversion measurements. The demonstrated techniques are compatible with high-power UV laser systems used in RF-photoinjectors and offer a practical route toward structured photocathode illumination and the generation of relativistic vortex electrons at a particle accelerator facility."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in snapshot multispectral (MS) imaging have enabled compact, low-cost spectral sensors for consumer and mobile devices. By capturing richer spectral information than conventional RGB sensors, these systems can enhance key imaging tasks, including color correction. However, most existing methods treat the color correction pipeline in separate stages, often discarding MS data early in the process. We propose a unified, learning-based framework that (i) performs end-to-end color correction and (ii) jointly leverages data from a high-resolution RGB sensor and an auxiliary low-resolution MS sensor. Our approach integrates the full pipeline within a single model, producing coherent and color-accurate outputs. We demonstrate the flexibility and generality of our framework by refactoring two different state-of-the-art image-to-image architectures. To support training and evaluation, we construct a dedicated dataset by aggregating and repurposing publicly available spectral datasets, rendering under multiple RGB camera sensitivities. Extensive experiments show that our approach improves color accuracy and stability, reducing error by up to 50% compared to RGB-only and MS-driven baselines. Datasets, code, and models will be made available upon acceptance."

    "abstract": "Charging electric vehicles (EVs) with renewable energy can lessen their environmental impact. However, the fluctuating availability of renewable energy affects the sustainability of public EV charging stations. Nearby public charging stations may utilize differing energy sources due to their microgrid connections - ranging from exclusively renewable to non-renewable or a combination of both - highlighting the substantial variability in energy supply types within short distances. This study investigates the near-future scenario of integrating dynamic renewable energy availability in charging station navigation to impact the choices of EV users towards renewable sources. We conducted a within-subjects design survey with 50 car users and semi-structured interviews with 10 EV users from rural, suburban, and urban areas. The results show that when choosing EV charging stations, drivers often prioritize either time savings or money savings based on the driving scenarios that influence drivers' consumer value. Notably, EV users tend to select renewable-powered stations when they align with their main priority, be it saving money or time. This study offers end-user insights into the front-end graphic user interface and the development of the back-end ranking algorithm for navigation recommender systems that integrate dynamic renewable energy availability for the sustainable use of electric vehicles."

In order to rationalize and control this growth, a model is derived that revisits the dewetting thermodynamics and considers generally ignored adsorption and step-edge energies. The model is investigated using kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations and mean-field rate equations, and implemented by close inspection of microscopy images. This model perfectly reproduces the experimental outcomes, unveiling an anomalous growth mode, and provides guidelines on experimental conditions for high-quality silicene growth."

It is imperative to understand the dynamics of such particles in pressure-driven microfluidic devices to manipulate their motion. We analytically examine the dynamics of an internally actuated elastic particle translating in a general unbounded quadratic flow in the inertialess limit. We consider the particle as a compressible weakly elastic sphere, and its motion is controlled by applying an external point force and a point torque at the centre of its undeformed shape. The fluid and the particle are modelled using the Stokes and the Navier elasticity equations, respectively. We use the domain perturbation method to capture the particle deformation. The point force and the point torque are obtained until \\textit{O}($α^2$), assuming $α\\ll 1$. Here, $α$ is the measure of the particle elastic strain induced due to the fluid viscous stress. We present the results for the particle motion in a general unbounded quadratic flow. The results are simplified further for the motion along the centreline in the quadratic component of three Poiseuille flows: 1) elliptical Poiseuille, 2) plane Poiseuille, and 3) Hagen-Poiseuille flows. In the general quadratic flow, the point force at \\textit{O}($α$) is aligned with the particle velocity, while the force at \\textit{O}($α^2$) acts at an angle to the velocity. Furthermore, the torque is non-zero due to elastic effects at \\textit{O}($α$) and \\textit{O}($α^2$). For all the three Poiseuille flows, the point force until \\textit{O}($α^2$) is aligned with the particle velocity, while the torque comes as zero."

In this paper, we propose a generative latent flow matching model to anticipate future audio observations, enabling the system to reason about long-term consequences when integrated into a robot policy. We demonstrate the superior capabilities of our system through two manipulation tasks that require perceiving in-the-wild audio or music signals, compared to methods without future lookahead. We further emphasize that successful robot action learning for these tasks relies not merely on multi-modal input, but critically on the accurate prediction of future audio states that embody intrinsic rhythmic patterns."

By deploying retro-directive antenna arrays (RAA) at transceivers, RF-RBS establishes a self-sustaining cyclic electromagnetic loop. This mechanism inherently enables self-aligning, high-gain beamforming through positive feedback, eliminating the reliance on digital CSI processing. We analyze the system's architecture and its capability to support high-efficiency WPT, robust communication, and millimeter-level passive positioning.

We present a statistical framework that includes such parameters. We assess the consistency of the GW190521-ZTF19abanrhr pair with two types of emission processes: a Blandford-Znajek jet closely aligned with the final spin axis and a diffusive isotropic flare. Assuming the sky-location of ZTF19abanrhr, we find these mechanisms to be respectively strongly and moderately disfavoured with log-evidences $\\log_{10}{\\cal I}_{\\rm jet} = -1.65$ and $\\log_{10}{\\cal I}_{\\rm diff} = -0.075$.

    "abstract": "Black holes, the simplest solution to Einstein's field equations, do not emit light, making their observations a major challenge for researchers. However, discovery of binary black holes (BBHs) in 2015 by LIGO has transformed the study of compact objects, with over 300 BBHs recorded, providing a new avenue for probing new physics. GWs remain a prominent and precise method of observing not only BBHs, but also dark matter and cosmic strings. Cosmic strings -- hypothetical one dimensional topological defects formed in the early universe, are yet to be observed, with multiple detection methods such as particle radiation, gravitational waves and lensing being proposed. Here we present a novel framework to search for cosmic strings by modeling them as perturbations within non-rotating black hole spacetime, focusing on their imprint on the spectrum of quasinormal modes (QNMs). Our numerical simulations identify a lower limit on perturbation strength, $λ\\sim 10^{-10}$ for uncharged string and $λ\\sim 10^{-7}$ for charged string, below which cosmic string effects become unobservable in QNM signals. By analyzing eigenvalue splitting and centers, we show that cosmic string properties impart distinct and detectable features to GW signals. Our results establish QNM analysis as a powerful, alternative observational strategy for constraining or detecting cosmic strings, and offer an inverse approach to estimate string energy or charge if a signal is detected. With upgrades in LIGO technologies and advanced multimessenger astronomy under development, these findings highlight new potential for detecting cosmic strings."

    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) agents often rely on external demonstrations or retrieval-augmented planning, leading to brittleness, poor generalization, and high computational overhead. Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose DuSAR (Dual-Strategy Agent with Reflecting) - a demonstration-free framework that enables a single frozen LLM to perform co-adaptive reasoning via two complementary strategies: a high-level holistic plan and a context-grounded local policy. These strategies interact through a lightweight reflection mechanism, where the agent continuously assesses progress via a Strategy Fitness Score and dynamically revises its global plan when stuck or refines it upon meaningful advancement, mimicking human metacognitive behavior. On ALFWorld and Mind2Web, DuSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance with open-source LLMs (7B-70B), reaching 37.1% success on ALFWorld (Llama3.1-70B) - more than doubling the best prior result (13.0%) - and 4.02% on Mind2Web, also more than doubling the strongest baseline. Remarkably, it reduces per-step token consumption by 3-9X while maintaining strong performance. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of dual-strategy coordination. Moreover, optional integration of expert demonstrations further boosts results, highlighting DuSAR's flexibility and compatibility with external knowledge."

Our main contributions are twofold: (1) the derivation of both a priori and a posteriori error estimates of the $L^2$-norm and the energy norms, and (2) the implementation of an efficiently solvable discrete system, which is solved via a linearly convergent projected gradient descent method. Numerical experiments are provided to verify the convergence order in a priori estimate and the efficiency of a posteriori error estimate."

The underlying mode structure is well described by a Jackiw-Rebbi-like continuum theory with Dirac cones and solitonic zero modes in synthetic frequency. Our results establish a simple and experimentally feasible route to non-Hermitian topological amplification, naturally implementable in current quantum technologies such as superconducting circuits."

    "abstract": "Relaxation processes in topological phases such as quantum spin liquids are controlled by the dynamics and interaction of fractionalized excitations. In layered materials hosting two-dimensional topological phases, elementary quasiparticles can diffuse freely within the layer, whereas only pairs (or more) can hop between layers - a fundamental consequence of topological order. Using exact solutions of emergent nonlinear diffusion equations and particle-based stochastic simulations, we explore how pump-probe experiments can provide unique signatures of the presence of $2d$ topological excitations in a $3d$ material. Here we show that the characteristic time scale of such experiments is inversely proportional to the initial excitation density, set by the pump intensity. A uniform excitation density created on the surface of a sample spreads subdiffusively into the bulk with a mean depth $\\bar z$ scaling as $\\sim t^{1/3}$ when annihilation processes are absent. The propagation becomes logarithmic, $\\bar z \\sim \\log t$, when pair-annihilation is allowed. Furthermore, pair-diffusion between layers leads to a new decay law for the total density, $n(t) \\sim (\\log^2 t)/t$ - slower than in a purely $2d$ system. We discuss possible experimental implications for pump-probe experiments in samples of finite width."

    "abstract": "We consider a system of multiscale stochastic differential equations whose slow component is drivenby a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H greater than 1/2. Under ergodic assumptions ensuring the applicability of the fractional averaging and fractional homogenization theorems of Hairer and Li (arXiv:1902.11251, arXiv:2109.06948), we establish a fluctuation result. The deviation of the slow motion, scaled by epsilon^{1/2-H}, from its effective, time-dependent random limit converges, as the time-separation scale epsilon tends to zero, to the solution of a stochastic differential equation driven by a fractional Brownian motion and influenced by an additional space--time Gaussian field. Since the averaging principle and the fractional homogenization hold in different modes of convergence, obtaining the required joint convergence is a delicate matter. Moreover, neither the continuity of the Ito--Lyons solution map nor the martingale method is directly applicable for our purposes, so the proof requires several innovations. To establish the fluctuation theorem, we combine cumulant methods with a residue lemma and formulate the enlarged system as a rough differential equation in a suitable space."

Our approach incorporates explicit ab initio light-matter coupling and first-principles collision integrals for carrier-carrier, carrier-phonon, and phonon-phonon scattering. It also yields time-dependent quasiparticle and phonon frequency renormalizations, along with light-induced coherent atomic motion. The equations of motion are solved in a maximally localized Wannier basis, ensuring gauge-consistent scattering integrals and ultradense momentum sampling, thereby enabling direct comparison with pump-probe experiments. The method can be coupled to constrained density-functional theory to access light-induced structural phase transitions at longer times after the light pulse. We showcase the capabilities and predictive power of this framework on MoS$_2$ and h-BN monolayers. For MoS$_2$, we resolve photoinduced renormalizations of electronic and lattice properties, ultrafast carrier relaxation, hot-phonon dynamics, and displacive coherent atomic motion. Including carrier-carrier scattering is crucial to obtain realistic photocarrier equilibration times, while omitting phonon-phonon scattering leads to incorrect long-time lattice thermalization and a factor of two larger A$_{1g}$ coherent phonon damping time. For h-BN, we quantify photoinduced changes in the electronic, optical, and lattice responses in quasi-equilibrium, demonstrating a fluence-dependent enhancement of screening and melting of excitonic features."

We show that they combine into a bi-flat F-manifold. Conditions on open WDVV solutions imposed in previous work are retrieved in this setting, thus providing them with a geometrical meaning. Finally, explicit examples are computed. For Saito Frobenius manifolds of types $A$ and $D$, the extended prepotentials coincide with open WDVV solutions computed independently, whereas even the existence of the solution in type $E$ had not been previously discussed.

Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$ features a peculiar spin reorientation transition at $T_\\mathrm{SR} \\sim 110$ K suggesting a non-trivial temperature evolution of the magnetic anisotropy (MA) - one of the main contributors to the stabilization of the magnetic order in the low-D systems. An electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopic study reported here provides quantitative insights into the unusual magnetic anisotropy of Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$. At high temperatures the total MA is mostly given by the demagnetization effect with a small contribution of the counteracting intrinsic magnetic anisotropy of an easy-axis type, whose growth below a characteristic temperature $T_{\\rm shape} \\sim 150$ K renders the sample seemingly isotropic at $T_\\mathrm{SR}$. Below one further temperature $T_{\\rm d} \\sim 50$ K the intrinsic MA becomes even more complex. Importantly, all the characteristic temperatures found in the ESR experiment match those observed in transport measurements, suggesting an inherent coupling between magnetic and electronic degrees of freedom in Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$. This finding together with the observed signatures of the intrinsic two-dimensionality should facilitate optimization routes for the use of Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$ in the magneto-electronic devices, potentially even in the monolayer limit."

In the frame of the experiment, Q$_2$ behavior in different phases, ortho/para states, temperatures (10 K - 300 K) and pressures (up to 2.5 bar a) will be investigated with optical methods, infrared and Raman spectroscopy. The facility consists of a fully tritium compatible cryostat, which includes an optical cell, ortho/para converter and windows for optical and spectroscopic studies. The cryostat can be cooled below the H$_2$ triple point by a two-stage cryocooler and contains openings in the cryogenic shielding for the optical access. The challenge of combining these scientific requirements in a design with high amounts of tritium (14 g), in a limited space, all while maintaining the TLK safety philosophy was solved by the presented design. The experiment is ready to be fully integrated into the TLK closed loop tritium infrastructure. This contribution reports a comprehensive overview of the commissioning phase of the experimental facility and the results of the first commissioning experiments, including cryogenic performance tests, commissioning experiments with non-radioactive gases, and tests of the analytical instruments."

We provide precise asymptotics for this phenomenon, which is an echo of non-quasilocality happening in higher dimensions. Second, we turn to the one-sided point of view and prove that the TBF is a g-measure in the sense of dynamical systems and ergodic theory. The corresponding g-function is quasilocal but becomes long-range again for large $p$. From that we finally develop our third view, in which we provide a transparent construction of the process in terms of a driving Markov chain on the integers of generalized house of cards type, offering a novel perspective on the TBF."

This enables TabPFN to perform direct node classification without any graph-specific training or language model dependencies. Our experiments on 12 benchmark datasets reveal that TabPFN-GN achieves competitive performance with GNNs on homophilous graphs and consistently outperforms them on heterophilous graphs.

    "abstract": "The properties of dwarf galaxies provide essential insight into galaxy formation and evolution in a hierarchical universe. Among various physical quantities, identifying their infall times to host galaxies is crucial, as these times encode key information such as star formation histories. However, estimating infall times remains challenging due to the complex interplay between different physical processes and the lack of consensus among existing methods. We propose a fast and interpretable method to predict the infall time of dwarf satellites using LightGBM, a gradient-boosting decision tree algorithm. Our model is trained on satellites from 30 Milky Way (MW)-like host galaxies generated by A-SLOTH, a semi-analytic model calibrated using observational constraints, including those from the MW and its satellites. To balance predictive ability and observational applicability, we adopt $τ_{90}$, [Fe/H], and $M_{\\star}$ as input features. Since satellites with prior group membership hinder accurate MW infall predictions, we exclude them from the training data. As a result, the model achieves the best average mean squared error (MSE) of 5.04 in the A-SLOTH data set. Our model also shows good agreement with existing observational studies of MW satellites, although some discrepancies remain due to a few outliers such as CVn II and UMa I. In addition, for satellites experiencing prior infall events before MW-like host infall, the model predicts the timing of the first infall with a significantly lower MSE of 1.66, indicating the importance of the earliest infall in the quenching process of satellite galaxies."

Its development requires members' continuous participatory contribution and sensemaking. However, existing works mainly adopt a holistic sociological perspective to analyze well-developed collective memory, less focusing on member-level conceptualization of this possession or what the co-contribution practices can be. Therefore, this work alternatively adopts the latter perspective and probes such interpretative and interactional patterns with two mobile systems. With one being a locative narrative and exploration system condensed from existing literature's design frameworks, and the other being a conventional online forum representing current practices, they served as the anchors of observation for our two-week, mixed-methods field study (n=38) on a university campus. A core debate we have identified was to retrospectively contemplate or document the presence as a history for the future. This also subsequently impacted the narrative focuses, expectations of collective memory constituents, and the ways participants seek inspiration from the group. We further extracted design considerations that could better embrace the diverse conceptualizations of collective memory and bond different community members together. Lastly, revisiting and reflecting on our design, we provided extra insights on designing devoted locative narrative experiences for community-driven UGC platforms."

We introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework that systematically assesses the trade-off between alignment quality and fairness when using different aggregation strategies for human preferences. In our federated setting, each group locally evaluates rollouts and produces reward signals, and the server aggregates these group-level rewards without accessing any raw data. Specifically, we evaluate standard reward aggregation techniques (min, max, and average) and introduce a novel adaptive scheme that dynamically adjusts preference weights based on a group's historical alignment performance. Our experiments on question-answering (Q/A) tasks using a PPO-based RLHF pipeline demonstrate that our adaptive approach consistently achieves superior fairness while maintaining competitive alignment scores. This work offers a robust methodology for evaluating LLM behavior across diverse populations and provides a practical solution for developing truly pluralistic and fairly aligned models."

In both cases, the dominant contribution to the bremsstrahlung emissivity $Q^{\\mathrm{em}}_{\\mathrm{Br}}$ comes from the transverse part of in-medium electromagnetic interactions. For non-superconducting matter, we obtain an unusual $Q^{\\mathrm{em}}_{\\mathrm{Br}}\\propto T^{23/3}$ temperature dependence due to the dynamical character of plasma screening in the transverse channel, but considerably smaller values of $Q^{\\mathrm{em}}_{\\mathrm{Br}}$ than in previous studies, rendering the considered process unimportant in practice. In contrast, for superconducting and superfluid matter, the neutrino emission processes involving nucleons are suppressed and $Q^{\\mathrm{em}}_{\\mathrm{Br}}$ due to lepton collisions provides the residual contribution to the neutrino emissivity of neutron star core matter.

Thus, in this work, we focus on developing a fluent preference-aligned language model without any instruction-tuning data in the target language. Our approach uses an on-policy training method, which we compare with two common approaches: supervised finetuning on machine-translated data and multilingual finetuning. We conduct a case study on Norwegian Bokmål and evaluate fluency through native-speaker assessments. The results show that the on-policy aspect is crucial and outperforms the alternatives without relying on any hard-to-obtain data."

    "abstract": "Terpene synthases (TPS) are a key family of enzymes responsible for generating the diverse terpene scaffolds that underpin many natural products, including front-line anticancer drugs such as Taxol. However, de novo TPS design through directed evolution is costly and slow. We introduce TpsGPT, a generative model for scalable TPS protein design, built by fine-tuning the protein language model ProtGPT2 on 79k TPS sequences mined from UniProt. TpsGPT generated de novo enzyme candidates in silico and we evaluated them using multiple validation metrics, including EnzymeExplorer classification, ESMFold structural confidence (pLDDT), sequence diversity, CLEAN classification, InterPro domain detection, and Foldseek structure alignment. From an initial pool of 28k generated sequences, we identified seven putative TPS enzymes that satisfied all validation criteria. Experimental validation confirmed TPS enzymatic activity in at least two of these sequences. Our results show that fine-tuning of a protein language model on a carefully curated, enzyme-class-specific dataset, combined with rigorous filtering, can enable the de novo generation of functional, evolutionarily distant enzymes."

    "abstract": "We present Wan-Move, a simple and scalable framework that brings motion control to video generative models. Existing motion-controllable methods typically suffer from coarse control granularity and limited scalability, leaving their outputs insufficient for practical use. We narrow this gap by achieving precise and high-quality motion control. Our core idea is to directly make the original condition features motion-aware for guiding video synthesis. To this end, we first represent object motions with dense point trajectories, allowing fine-grained control over the scene. We then project these trajectories into latent space and propagate the first frame's features along each trajectory, producing an aligned spatiotemporal feature map that tells how each scene element should move. This feature map serves as the updated latent condition, which is naturally integrated into the off-the-shelf image-to-video model, e.g., Wan-I2V-14B, as motion guidance without any architecture change. It removes the need for auxiliary motion encoders and makes fine-tuning base models easily scalable. Through scaled training, Wan-Move generates 5-second, 480p videos whose motion controllability rivals Kling 1.5 Pro's commercial Motion Brush, as indicated by user studies. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further design MoveBench, a rigorously curated benchmark featuring diverse content categories and hybrid-verified annotations. It is distinguished by larger data volume, longer video durations, and high-quality motion annotations. Extensive experiments on MoveBench and the public dataset consistently show Wan-Move's superior motion quality. Code, models, and benchmark data are made publicly available."

    "abstract": "Early graph prompt tuning approaches relied on task-specific designs for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), limiting their adaptability across diverse pre-training strategies. In contrast, another promising line of research has investigated universal graph prompt tuning, which operates directly in the input graph's feature space and builds a theoretical foundation that universal graph prompt tuning can theoretically achieve an equivalent effect of any prompting function, eliminating dependence on specific pre-training strategies. Recent works propose selective node-based graph prompt tuning to pursue more ideal prompts. However, we argue that selective node-based graph prompt tuning inevitably compromises the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning. In this paper, we strengthen the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning by introducing stricter constraints, demonstrating that adding prompts to all nodes is a necessary condition for achieving the universality of graph prompts. To this end, we propose a novel model and paradigm, Learning and Editing Universal GrAph Prompt Tuning (LEAP), which preserves the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning while pursuing more ideal prompts. Specifically, we first build the basic universal graph prompts to preserve the theoretical foundation and then employ actor-critic reinforcement learning to select nodes and edit prompts. Extensive experiments on graph- and node-level tasks across various pre-training strategies in both full-shot and few-shot scenarios show that LEAP consistently outperforms fine-tuning and other prompt-based approaches."

Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of a spontaneous-symmetry-breaking ratchet current in the partially wet state, leading to departure of the bulk densities from their binodal values and the emergence of a novel dynamical pathway for the full-to-partial wetting transition. We elucidate this modified dynamical pathway using a minimal model. The results, while establishing a direct connection between active and equilibrium wetting, also identify the nonequilibrium consequences of activity."

In this scenario, we calculate the vacuum energy density and its first-order correction in the coupling constants of the theory. Additionally, we consider the mass correction for each field separately, namely the topological mass that arises from the boundary conditions imposed on the fields and which also depends on the coupling constants. To develop this analysis, we use the mathematical formalism known as the effective potential, expressed as a path integral in quantum field theory."

A natural response is \"agents-at-stake\": binding economically meaningful, slashable collateral to persistent identities and adjudicating misbehavior with verifiable evidence. However, heterogeneous tasks make universal verification brittle and centralization-prone, while traditional reputation struggles under rapid model drift and opaque internal states. We propose a protocol-native alternative: insured agents. Specialized insurer agents post stake on behalf of operational agents in exchange for premiums, and receive privileged, privacy-preserving audit access via TEEs to assess claims. A hierarchical insurer market calibrates stake through pricing, decentralizes verification via competitive underwriting, and yields incentive-compatible dispute resolution."

Such group-based approaches risk obscuring biases faced by outliers within subgroups. This study introduces a distribution-based framework for evaluating and mitigating individual fairness in skin lesion classification. We treat skin tone as a continuous attribute rather than a categorical label, and employ kernel density estimation (KDE) to model its distribution. We further compare twelve statistical distance metrics to quantify disparities between skin tone distributions and propose a distance-based reweighting (DRW) loss function to correct underrepresentation in minority tones. Experiments across CNN and Transformer models demonstrate: (i) the limitations of categorical reweighting in capturing individual-level disparities, and (ii) the superior performance of distribution-based reweighting, particularly with Fidelity Similarity (FS), Wasserstein Distance (WD), Hellinger Metric (HM), and Harmonic Mean Similarity (HS). These findings establish a robust methodology for advancing fairness at individual level in dermatological AI systems, and highlight broader implications for sensitive continuous attributes in medical image analysis."

    "abstract": "Background: Adolescence is a critical period of brain maturation and heightened vulnerability to cognitive and mental health disorders. Sleep plays a vital role in neurodevelopment, yet the mechanisms linking insufficient sleep to adverse brain and behavioral outcomes remain unclear. The glymphatic system (GS), a brain-wide clearance pathway, may provide a key mechanistic link. Methods: Participants from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (n =6,800; age ~ 11 years) were categorized into sleep-sufficient (>=9 h/night) and sleep-insufficient (<9 h/night) groups. Linear models tested associations among sleep, PVS burden, brain volumes, and behavioral outcomes. Mediation analyses evaluated whether PVS burden explained sleep-related effects. Results: Adolescents with insufficient sleep exhibited significantly greater PVS burden, reduced cortical, subcortical, and white matter volumes, poorer cognitive performance across multiple domains (largest effect in crystallized intelligence), and elevated psychopathology (largest effect in general problems). Sleep duration and quality were strongly associated with PVS burden. Mediation analyses revealed that PVS burden partially mediated sleep effects on cognition and mental health, with indirect proportions up to 10.9%. Sequential models suggested a pathway from sleep -> PVS -> brain volume -> behavior as the most plausible route. Conclusions: Insufficient sleep during adolescence is linked to glymphatic dysfunction, reflected by increased PVS burden, which partially accounts for adverse effects on brain structure, cognition, and mental health. These findings highlight the GS as a potential mechanistic pathway and imaging biomarker, underscoring the importance of promoting adequate sleep to support neurodevelopment and mental health."

    "abstract": "Although existing multimodal recommendation models have shown promising performance, their effectiveness continues to be limited by the pervasive data sparsity problem. This problem arises because users typically interact with only a small subset of available items, leading existing models to arbitrarily treat unobserved items as negative samples. To this end, we propose VI-MMRec, a model-agnostic and training cost-free framework that enriches sparse user-item interactions via similarity-aware virtual user-item interactions. These virtual interactions are constructed based on modality-specific feature similarities of user-interacted items. Specifically, VI-MMRec introduces two different strategies: (1) Overlay, which independently aggregates modality-specific similarities to preserve modality-specific user preferences, and (2) Synergistic, which holistically fuses cross-modal similarities to capture complementary user preferences. To ensure high-quality augmentation, we design a statistically informed weight allocation mechanism that adaptively assigns weights to virtual user-item interactions based on dataset-specific modality relevance. As a plug-and-play framework, VI-MMRec seamlessly integrates with existing models to enhance their performance without modifying their core architecture. Its flexibility allows it to be easily incorporated into various existing models, maximizing performance with minimal implementation effort. Moreover, VI-MMRec introduces no additional overhead during training, making it significantly advantageous for practical deployment. Comprehensive experiments conducted on six real-world datasets using seven state-of-the-art multimodal recommendation models validate the effectiveness of our VI-MMRec."

Although these systems are often accompanied by formal specifications that are verified using model-checking techniques, a gap still exists between the implementation and its formal specification: there is no guarantee that the implementation is free of bugs. To bridge this gap, we can use model-based testing. Specifically, if the model of the system can be interpreted as a finite-state automaton, we can generate an exhaustive test suite for the implementation that covers all possible states and transitions. In this paper, we discuss how to efficiently generate such a test suite for distributed systems written in the actor model. Importantly, our approach does not require any modifications to the code or interfering with the distributed system execution environment. As an example, we verified an implementation of a replication algorithm based on Viewstamped Replication, which is used in a real-world system."

At low intensity, the interaction could simply be the linear refraction provided by a glass optical fiber to keep the pulse from spreading. At increased pulse intensity, more than diffraction-free pulse transport is of interest: an extended interaction length of high intensity light can give rise to bright secondary sources of photons, and at relativistic intensities, beams of high energy charged particles. As generation of these secondary sources requires laser intensities well above the threshold for ionization of atoms, new methods for defeating pulse diffraction in a plasma have been developed. Chief among them are plasma waveguides: optical fibers composed of plasma that have characteristic mode structure. This article reviews the methods and theory of plasma waveguides, highlighting the recent development of meter-scale plasma waveguides that have been instrumental to the laser acceleration of high charge electron beams to ~10 GeV."

An infinite subfamily of Paley triple arrays turns out to be resolvable. We also introduce a new intermediate object, unordered triple arrays, that are to triple arrays what symmetric 2-designs are to Youden rectangles, and propose a strengthening of Agrawal's long-standing conjecture on the existence of extremal triple arrays. For small parameters, we completely enumerate all unordered triple arrays, and use this data to corroborate the new conjecture. We construct several infinite families of resolvable unordered triple arrays, and, in particular, show that all $((q + 1) \\times q^2, q(q + 1))$-triple arrays are resolvable and are in correspondence with finite affine planes of order $q$."

Recently, Kang, Koh, and Tran have extended this phenomenon to the circle group, proving that there exists a measurable partition of the circle such that every finite measurable cover admits a rotation whose image meets each part of the partition in positive measure. This paper shows that this phenomenon extends beyond compact abelian groups to a wide class of non-group geometric surfaces that still exhibit \\textit{a hidden one-dimensional symmetry}. Specifically, we establish analogs of Raimi's theorem for three families of surfaces (with their natural surface measures): the unit sphere $S^{n-1} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, rotational power surfaces (such as cones and paraboloids), and circular cylindrical surfaces. The common feature is that each of these surfaces carries a natural measure-preserving action of the circle group by rotation in a fixed plane and admits a measurable trivialization as a product $C \\times Y$. This circle-bundle structure allows the measurable Raimi partition on the base circle to be lifted to an unavoidable partition on the manifold. Our approach is unified through a general circle-bundle theorem, which reduces all three geometric cases to verifying suitable equivariance and product disintegration properties of the surface measure."

However, these generative methods have been proven to struggle to capture high-level discriminative features effectively, leading to poor performance on linear probing and other downstream tasks. In contrast, contrastive methods excel in discriminative feature representation and generalization ability on image data. Despite this, contrastive learning (CL) in 3D data remains scarce. Besides, simply applying CL methods designed for 2D data to 3D fails to effectively learn 3D local details. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Dual-Branch \\textbf{C}enter-\\textbf{S}urrounding \\textbf{Con}trast (CSCon) framework. Specifically, we apply masking to the center and surrounding parts separately, constructing dual-branch inputs with center-biased and surrounding-biased representations to better capture rich geometric information. Meanwhile, we introduce a patch-level contrastive loss to further enhance both high-level information and local sensitivity. Under the FULL and ALL protocols, CSCon achieves performance comparable to generative methods; under the MLP-LINEAR, MLP-3, and ONLY-NEW protocols, our method attains state-of-the-art results, even surpassing cross-modal approaches. In particular, under the MLP-LINEAR protocol, our method outperforms the baseline (Point-MAE) by \\textbf{7.9\\%}, \\textbf{6.7\\%}, and \\textbf{10.3\\%} on the three variants of ScanObjectNN, respectively.

    "abstract": "Holonomic autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have the hardware ability for agile maneuvering in both translational and rotational degrees of freedom (DOFs). However, due to challenges inherent to underwater vehicles, such as complex hydrostatics and hydrodynamics, parametric uncertainties, and frequent changes in dynamics due to payload changes, control is challenging. Performance typically relies on carefully tuned controllers targeting unique platform configurations, and a need for re-tuning for deployment under varying payloads and hydrodynamic conditions. As a consequence, agile maneuvering with simultaneous tracking of time-varying references in both translational and rotational DOFs is rarely utilized in practice. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first general zero-shot sim2real deep reinforcement learning-based (DRL) velocity controller enabling path following and agile 6DOF maneuvering with a training duration of just 3 minutes. Sim2Swim, the proposed approach, inspired by state-of-the-art DRL-based position control, leverages domain randomization and massively parallelized training to converge to field-deployable control policies for AUVs of variable characteristics without post-processing or tuning. Sim2Swim is extensively validated in pool trials for a variety of configurations, showcasing robust control for highly agile motions."

In this manuscript, we present a complete and fully self contained proof of global existence. More precisely, we prove the global existence of finite energy weak solutions to the QNSP system with high friction and large initial data on the three-dimensional torus. The model describes a compressible, viscous quantum fluid with Korteweg type capillarity effects, and allows for degenerate viscosity and vacuum regions. The construction proceeds in two main steps. First, it is introduced a Faedo Galerkin approximation endowed with suitable damping mechanisms, which yields smooth approximate solutions through compactness arguments. Then, it will be justify the convergence of the approximating sequence by combining a truncation of the momentum equation with DiPerna Lions commutator estimates, providing the required control over the nonlinear transport structure."

Rubin Observatory, is a wide-field multi-band survey that will revolutionize our understanding of extragalactic sources through its unprecedented combination of area and depth. While the LSST survey strategy is still being finalized, the Rubin Observatory team has generated a series of survey simulations using the LSST Operations Simulator to explore the optimal survey strategy that best accommodates the majority of scientific goals. In this study, we utilize the latest simulated data to predict the number of detectable quasars by LSST in each band and evaluate the impact of different survey strategies. We find that the number of quasars and lower luminosity AGNs detected in the baseline strategy (v4.3.1) in the redshift range z=0.3-6.7 will be highest in the i-band and lowest in the u-band. Over 70% of quasars are expected to be detected within the first year in all bands, as LSST will have already reached the break of the luminosity function at most redshifts. With a limiting magnitude of 25.7 mag, we expect to detect 184 million AGNs in the z-band over the 10-year survey, with quasars constituting only 6% of the total AGNs in each band. This arises because, considering that the luminosities of most low-luminosity AGNs are affected by contamination from their host galaxies, we set a magnitude threshold when predicting the number of quasars. We find that variations in the u-band strategy can impact the number of quasar detections. Specifically, the difference between the baseline strategy and that with the largest total exposure in u is 15%. In contrast, changes in rolling strategies, DDF strategies, weather conditions, and Target of Opportunity observations result in variations below 2%. These results provide valuable insights for optimizing approaches to maximize the scientific output of quasar studies."

While deterministic generation of CV states via Kerr-induced two-mode squeezing has been demonstrated, achieving spectrally uniform squeezing remains challenging because of asymmetry and anomalies in the dispersion profile. Here we overcome these limitations by combining a microresonator with an engineered mode spectrum and optimized pump conditions. We realize a CV quantum microcomb comprising 14 independent two-mode squeezed states, each exhibiting more than 4 dB of raw squeezing (up to 4.3 dB) across a 0.7 THz bandwidth. This uniform, high-performance quantum resource represents a key step toward scalable, integrated CV quantum technologies operating beyond classical limits."

This task holds promise for real-world applications such as low-altitude inspection, search-and-rescue, and autonomous aerial delivery. Existing methods often rely on panoramic images, depth inputs, or odometry to support spatial reasoning and action planning. These requirements increase system cost and integration complexity, thus hindering practical deployment for lightweight UAVs. We present a unified aerial VLN framework that operates solely on egocentric monocular RGB observations and natural language instructions. The model formulates navigation as a next-token prediction problem, jointly optimizing spatial perception, trajectory reasoning, and action prediction through prompt-guided multi-task learning. Moreover, we propose a keyframe selection strategy to reduce visual redundancy by retaining semantically informative frames, along with an action merging and label reweighting mechanism that mitigates long-tailed supervision imbalance and facilitates stable multi-task co-training. Extensive experiments on the Aerial VLN benchmark validate the effectiveness of our method. Under the challenging monocular RGB-only setting, our model achieves strong results across both seen and unseen environments. It significantly outperforms existing RGB-only baselines and narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art panoramic RGB-D counterparts. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate the contribution of our task design and architectural choices."

The improvement is not in the result or the conditions, but in the need of weaker tools on the proof itself. More precisely, we only employ modular polynomials of prime degree, instead of polynomials of arbitrary level. Furthermore, one can restrict to primes in fixed arithmetic sequence. On the proof itself, the only crucial difference appears in Cinquième pas and on the final contradiction in Septième pas of Waldschmidt's proof, but for readability, we present a complete proof with this modification. This is part of a larger project to generalize the Stéphanois theorem to the Igusa invariants of curves of genus two, as the Siegel modular polynomials in the literature are usually only considered for prime levels.

With the rising focus on spatial AI in recent years, combining SLAM with semantic understanding has become increasingly important for enabling intelligent perception and interaction. Recent efforts have explored this integration, but they often rely on depth sensors or closed-set semantic models, limiting their scalability and adaptability in open-world environments. In this work, we present OpenMonoGS-SLAM, the first monocular SLAM framework that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with open-set semantic understanding. To achieve our goal, we leverage recent advances in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), including MASt3R for visual geometry and SAM and CLIP for open-vocabulary semantics. These models provide robust generalization across diverse tasks, enabling accurate monocular camera tracking and mapping, as well as a rich understanding of semantics in open-world environments. Our method operates without any depth input or 3D semantic ground truth, relying solely on self-supervised learning objectives. Furthermore, we propose a memory mechanism specifically designed to manage high-dimensional semantic features, which effectively constructs Gaussian semantic feature maps, leading to strong overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to or surpassing existing baselines in both closed-set and open-set segmentation tasks, all without relying on supplementary sensors such as depth maps or semantic annotations."

    "abstract": "Compact Runge-Kutta (cRK) Flux Reconstruction (FR) methods are a variant of RKFR methods for hyperbolic conservation laws with a compact stencil including only immediate neighboring finite elements. We extend cRKFR methods to handle hyperbolic equations with stiff source terms and non-conservative products. To handle stiff source terms, we use IMplicit EXplicit (IMEX) time integration schemes such that the implicitness is local to each solution point, and thus does not increase inter-element communication. Although non-conservative products do not correspond to a physical flux, we formulate the scheme using numerical fluxes at element interfaces. We use similar numerical fluxes for a lower order finite volume scheme on subcells of each element, which is then blended with the high order cRKFR scheme to obtain a robust scheme for problems with non-smooth solutions. Combined with a flux limiter at the element interfaces, the subcell based blending scheme preserves the physical admissibility of the solution, e.g., positivity of density and pressure for compressible Euler equations. The procedure thus leads to an admissibility preserving IMEX cRKFR scheme for hyperbolic equations with stiff source terms and non-conservative products. The capability of the scheme to handle stiff terms is shown through numerical tests involving Burgers' equations, reactive Euler's equations, and the ten moment problem. The non-conservative treatment is tested using variable advection equations, shear shallow water equations, the GLM-MHD, and the multi-ion MHD equations."

    "abstract": "During their formative stages, giant planets are fed by infalling material sourced from the background circumstellar disk. Due to conservation of angular momentum, the incoming gas and dust collects into a circumplanetary disk that processes the material before it reaches the central planet itself. This work investigates the complex vertical structure of these circumplanetary disks and calculates their radiative signatures. A self-consistent numerical model of the temperature and density structure of the circumplanetary environment reveals that circumplanetary disks are thick and hot, with aspect ratios $H/R\\sim0.1-0.25$ and temperatures approaching that of the central planet. The disk geometry has a significant impact on the radiative signatures, allowing future observations to determine critical system parameters. The resulting disks are gravitationally stable and viscosity is sufficient to drive the necessary disk accretion. However, sufficiently rapid mass accretion can trigger a thermal instability, which sets an upper limit on the mass accretion rate. This paper shows how the radiative signatures depend on the properties of the planetary system and discuss how the system parameters can be constrained by future observations."

Existing methods, including positioning based on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and triple Base Stations (BSs) techniques, cannot provide reliable performance under NLoS conditions, particularly in dense urban areas with strong multipath effects. To address this limitation, we propose a single BS localization framework that integrates sequential signal measurements with prior radio information embedded in the Radio Map (RM). Using temporal measurement features and matching them with radio maps, the proposed method effectively mitigates the adverse impact of multipath propagation and reduces the dependence on LoS paths. Simulation experiments further evaluate the impact of different radio map construction strategies and the varying lengths of the measurement sequence on localization accuracy. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves sub-meter positioning accuracy in typical NLoS environments, highlighting its potential as a practical and robust solution for single-base-station deployment."

    "abstract": "This article presents a systematic method for designing time-varying Control Barrier Functions (CBF) composed of a time-invariant component and multiple time-dependent components, leveraging structural properties of the system dynamics. The method involves the construction of a specific class of time-invariant CBFs that encode the system's dynamic capabilities with respect to a given constraint, and augments them subsequently with appropriately designed time-dependent transformations. While transformations uniformly varying the time-invariant CBF can be applied to arbitrary systems, transformations exploiting structural properties in the dynamics - equivariances in particular - enable the handling of a broader and more expressive class of time-varying constraints. The article shows how to leverage such properties in the design of time-varying CBFs. The proposed method decouples the design of time variations from the computationally expensive construction of the underlying CBFs, thereby providing a computationally attractive method to the design of time-varying CBFs. The method accounts for input constraints and under-actuation, and requires only qualitative knowledge on the time-variation of the constraints making it suitable to the application in uncertain environments."

We exploit this representation to construct new families of maximum sum-rank distance (MSRD) codes over finite and infinite fields, and over division rings. These constructions generalize many of the known existing constructions of MSRD codes as well as of optimal codes in the rank and in the Hamming metric. As a byproduct, in the case of finite fields we obtain new families of MDS codes which are linear over a subfield and whose length is close to the field size."

While most research has examined how general-purpose GenAI can support writing, fewer studies have investigated how students interact with pedagogically designed systems across different phases of the writing process. To address this gap, we evaluated a GenAI-driven essay-writing assistant (EWA) designed to support higher education students in argumentative writing. Drawing on 1,282 interaction logs from 32 undergraduates during a two-hour writing session, Sequential Pattern Mining and K-Means clustering were used to identify behavioral patterns. Two clusters emerged: Cluster 1 emphasized outline planning and essay structure, while Cluster 2 focused on content development. A Mann-Whitney U test revealed a moderate effect size (r = 0.36) in the essay Organization dimension, with Cluster 1 showing higher scores. Qualitative analysis indicated that students with better performance actively wrote and shared essay sections with EWA for feedback, rather than interacted passively by asking questions. These findings suggest implications for teaching and system design. Teachers can encourage active engagement, while future EWAs may integrate automatic labeling and monitoring to prompt students to move from questioning to writing, enabling fuller benefits from GenAI-supported learning."

To advance forecasting in this domain, we introduce a newly constructed longitudinal NBA dataset covering the 2004-05 to 2024-25 seasons and present a deep learning framework designed to model long-term performance trends. Our primary contribution is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture that leverages an extended sequence length of 9,840 games equivalent to eight full NBA seasons to capture evolving team dynamics and season-over-season dependencies. We compare this model against several traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) baselines, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The LSTM achieves the best performance across all metrics, with 72.35 accuracy, 73.15 precision and 76.13 AUC-ROC. These results demonstrate the importance of long-sequence temporal modeling in basketball outcome prediction and highlight the value of our new multi-season dataset for developing robust, generalizable NBA forecasting systems."

Experimental results conducted on a large set of new very large test problems, comprising up to 2,000 locations and 2,000 customers, demonstrate that PaKS outperforms both the standard KS heuristic and CPLEX in terms of quality of the solution found, finding the largest number of best solutions, and achieving the smallest average gap."

Cyber-threats become more sophisticated as the technology advances. This emphasises the need for strong risk mitigation strategies. To define strong and robust cybersecurity, policies requires an integrated approach of balancing technical expertise with public input. This paper aims to explore strategies used to balance technical expertise and public input to develop effective and robust cybersecurity policies. It also studied how the effective integration of technical expertise with public input is critical to developing effective strategies and resilient cybersecurity frameworks that strengthens national security. A lack of a holistic approach and collaborative efforts to cybersecurity can hinder the effectiveness of cybersecurity policies. This paper followed a systematic literature review with bibliometric analysis using the PRISMA methodology to explore how technical expertise and public input can be integrated to guide cybersecurity policy making. The thematic analysis identified five important themes in developing effective cybersecurity policies, these key themes are: Multi-Stakeholder Involvement and Human Centric Approaches (MSI & HCA), Governance and Policy Frameworks (GPF), Technical Infrastructure (TI), Evaluation and Compliance (EC), and Legal Rights and Sovereignty (LRS). The synthesis shows that there is no adequate exploration of collaborative efforts which undermines the effectiveness of the cybersecurity policies. The findings suggest that inclusive, flexible governance strategies that integrate public input at every stage are necessary for future cybersecurity policy research and practice, which must shift away from a primarily technical and legal perspective."

Decades of work have advanced our understanding of visual representations, yet brain signals remain large and complex, and the space of possible visual concepts is vast. As a result, most studies remain small-scale, rely on manual inspection, focus on specific regions and properties, and rarely include systematic validation. We present a large-scale, automated framework for discovering and explaining visual representations across the human cortex. Our method comprises two main stages. First, we discover candidate interpretable patterns in fMRI activity through unsupervised, data-driven decomposition methods. Next, we explain each pattern by identifying the set of natural images that most strongly elicit it and generating a natural-language description of their shared visual meaning. To scale this process, we introduce an automated pipeline that tests multiple candidate explanations, assigns quantitative reliability scores, and selects the most consistent description for each voxel pattern. Our framework reveals thousands of interpretable patterns spanning many distinct visual concepts, including fine-grained representations previously unreported."

This discrepancy highlights a central puzzle in critical phenomena: what is the influence of asymmetry on scaling laws? For over a century, this question has been explored through examining violations of the empirical ``rectilinear diameter law'' for the subcritical coexistence curve, where asymmetry could generate singular corrections. Here, we extend this investigation to the supercritical regime. We propose a supercritical-subcritical correspondence, drawing a formal analogy between the subcritical coexistence curve and recently defined supercritical boundary lines ($L^\\pm$ lines). Our theory predicts that the linear mixing of physical fields - a hallmark of asymmetric systems - produces universal scaling corrections, with antisymmetric coefficients, in these supercritical loci. We verify these predictions using liquid-gas data from the NIST database and a model liquid-liquid transition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the same asymmetric scaling framework governs the behavior of higher-order cumulants in the order parameter distribution."

    "abstract": "Let $\\mathbb{K}$ be a field and let $f,g \\in \\mathbb{K}[x,y]$ be such that the ideal $\\ideal{f,g}$ is zero-dimensional. We study the Sylvester and Bézout resultant polynomial matrices, built by interpreting $f$ and $g$ as univariate polynomials in $x$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{K}[y]$. We characterize their Smith forms over $\\mathbb{K}[y]$ in terms of the dual spaces of differential operators, that were defined and studied by H. M. Möller et al. In particular, we show that, if the leading coefficients of $f$ and $g$ are coprime over $\\mathbb{K}[y]$, then the partial multiplicities of the Sylvester and Bézout resultant matrices coincide with certain integers, that we call Möller indices. These indices are uniquely determined by $\\ideal{f,g}$, and can be easily computed from a Gauss basis, as defined in [M. G. Marinari, H. M. Möller, T. Mora, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 348(8):3283--3321, 1996], of the dual spaces. We then generalize this result to the case of common factors in the leading coefficients, which correspond to intersections at $x=\\infty$, again describing all the invariant factors of Sylvester and Bézout resultant matrices. As a corollary, this fully characterizes the algebraic multiplicity of all the roots of the resultant $\\Res_x(f,g) \\in \\mathbb{K}[y]$ in terms of the intersection multiplicities for $f$ and $g$, including those arising from infinite intersections. We discuss both algebraic and computational implications of our results."

    "abstract": "A unique feature of gas xenon electroluminescent time projection chambers (GXeEL TPCs) in $0νββ$ searches is their ability to reconstruct event topology, in particular to distinguish \"single-electron\" from \"double-electron\" tracks, the latter being the signature of a $0νββ$ decay near the decay endpoint $Q_{ββ}$. Together with excellent energy resolution and the t$_0$ provided by primary scintillation, this topological information is key to suppressing backgrounds. Preserving EL, however, requires operating in pure xenon (with helium as the only benign additive), and in pure xenon the diffusion of drifting electrons is large. As a result, the fidelity of reconstructed tracks is limited both by diffusion and by the intrinsic blurring of EL amplification. We propose augmenting the detector with the ability to image not only the electron track but also the corresponding mirror ion track. Introducing trace amounts of NH$_3$ ($\\sim$100 ppb) converts Xe$^+$ ions into NH$_4^+$ while leaving EL unaffected. For events in the region-of-interest, an ion sensor positioned near the cathode at the projected barycenter captures the NH$_4^+$ ions. Electrons drift rapidly to the anode, producing the standard EL image, whereas the NH$_4^+$ ions drift slowly toward the cathode. Their slow drift provides time to determine the event energy and barycenter. Laser interrogation of the sensor's molecular layer then reveals an ion-track image with sub-millimeter diffusion and no EL-induced smearing. The combined electron-ion imaging substantially strengthens topological discrimination, improving background rejection by about an order of magnitude and significantly extending the discovery potential of GXeEL TPCs for very long $0νββ$ lifetimes."

    "abstract": "Context: Recently, JWST/NIRSpec observations have provided the first detections of warm ionised outflows in low-mass galaxies at high redshifts (z>3), revealing an occurrence rate of 25-40% depending on the intensity of the emission lines. This fraction is lower than predicted by simulations, which suggest that fast outflowing gas should be a common feature of all star-forming galaxies in the early Universe. Aims: In order to better understand the discrepancies between simulations and observations, we identify and characterize outflows in high-redshift galaxies using the TNG50 cosmological and SERRA zoom-in simulations. Our study examines how outflow detectability depends on the line of sight, explores the properties of the fast gas, and investigates its relationship with key galactic properties. Methods: We analyse approximately 60000 galaxies from TNG50 and 3000 galaxies from SERRA over the redshift ranges z=3-5 and z=4-5, respectively, spanning stellar masses of Mstar=10^7.5-10^11Msun. Outflows in the immediate vicinity of each galaxy are identified using a Gaussian mixture model algorithm that uses the gas velocity, star-formation-rate, and location as input parameters. We subsequently compare the simulated outflows to those observed in the JWST/JADES NIRSpec survey. Results: Outflow masses in both TNG50 and SERRA broadly reproduce the JWST/JADES measurements within roughly 0.5dex, though simulations tend to predict slightly higher values, suggesting that optical emission lines capture only a fraction of the multiphase outflow. However, simulated outflow velocities are typically an order of magnitude lower than those inferred from observations. TNG50 indicates a clear orientation dependence as outflows in face-on galaxies are approximately 15% more likely to be detected than in edge-on systems, with this difference increasing to nearly 40% for more massive, disc-shaped galaxies."

    "abstract": "Neutrino oscillation experiments have confirmed that neutrinos are massive particles and lepton flavors are mixed. To explain the observed lepton mass spectra and flavor mixing patterns, flavor symmetry plays a crucial and unique role. In this paper, we propose a useful symmetry-breaking scheme by applying $S_{3L} \\times S_{3R} \\rightarrow S_{2L} \\times S_{2R} \\rightarrow \\emptyset$ within both charged-lepton and neutrino sectors at the mass-matrix level. For the three distinct residual subgroups $S_{2L}^{(23)} \\times S_{2R}^{(23)}$, $S_{2L}^{(13)} \\times S_{2R}^{(13)}$ and $S_{2L}^{(12)} \\times S_{2R}^{(12)}$ under consideration, we systematically analyze the various parameterizations of the lepton mass matrices. It is shown that all the three scenarios are in good agreement with current neutrino oscillation data. Notably, within the latest best-fit values of neutrino oscillation parameters, the predicted Dirac CP-violating phase $δ$ is calculated to be $294.6^\\circ$, $302.3^\\circ$ and $287.0^\\circ$, respectively. To further assess the viability of the model, a comprehensive numerical analysis is performed by utilizing neutrino oscillation parameters at the $3σ$ level. It is found that the allowed range of $δ$ is $281.2^\\circ \\rightarrow 338.7^\\circ$, $287.0^\\circ \\rightarrow 342.2^\\circ$ and $282.7^\\circ \\rightarrow 297.0^\\circ$, all fall within its $3σ$ range. These results indicate that the proposed symmetry-breaking scheme $S_{3L} \\times S_{3R} \\rightarrow S_{2L} \\times S_{2R} \\rightarrow \\emptyset$ can naturally explain the realistic lepton mass hierarchy and mixing pattern, thereby providing valuable theoretical perspectives for future research."

A domain expert provides the planning domain, problem details, and relevant high-level principles such as beneficence and privacy. The system generates operationalisable ethical rules consistent with these principles, which the user can review, prioritise, and supply to a planner to produce ethically-informed plans.

    "abstract": "Oil painting, as a high-level medium that blends human abstract thinking with artistic expression, poses substantial challenges for digital generation and editing due to its intricate brushstroke dynamics and stylized characteristics. Existing generation and editing techniques are often constrained by the distribution of training data and primarily focus on modifying real photographs. In this work, we introduce a unified multimodal framework for oil painting generation and editing. The proposed system allows users to incorporate reference images for precise semantic control, hand-drawn sketches for spatial structure alignment, and natural language prompts for high-level semantic guidance, while consistently maintaining a unified painting style across all outputs. Our method achieves interactive oil painting creation through three crucial technical advancements. First, we enhance the training stage with spatial alignment and semantic enhancement conditioning strategy, which map masks and sketches into spatial constraints, and encode contextual embedding from reference images and text into feature constraints, enabling object-level semantic alignment. Second, to overcome data scarcity, we propose a self-supervised style transfer pipeline based on Stroke-Based Rendering (SBR), which simulates the inpainting dynamics of oil painting restoration, converting real images into stylized oil paintings with preserved brushstroke textures to construct a large-scale paired training dataset. Finally, during inference, we integrate features using the AdaIN operator to ensure stylistic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our interactive system enables fine-grained editing while preserving the artistic qualities of oil paintings, achieving an unprecedented level of imagination realization in stylized oil paintings generation and editing."

    "abstract": "Multimodal language models (MLLMs) require large parameter capacity to align high-dimensional visual features with linguistic representations, making them computationally heavy and difficult to deploy efficiently. We introduce a progressive reparameterization strategy that compresses these models by gradually replacing dense feed-forward network blocks with compact Parameterized Hypercomplex Multiplication (PHM) layers. A residual interpolation schedule, together with lightweight reconstruction and knowledge distillation losses, ensures that the PHM modules inherit the functional behavior of their dense counterparts during training. This transition yields substantial parameter and FLOP reductions while preserving strong multimodal alignment, enabling faster inference without degrading output quality. We evaluate the approach on multiple vision-language models (VLMs). Our method maintains performance comparable to the base models while delivering significant reductions in model size and inference latency. Progressive PHM substitution thus offers an architecture-compatible path toward more efficient multimodal reasoning and complements existing low-bit quantization techniques."

    "abstract": "Accurate characterization of fast-ion behavior is essential for the safe and efficient operation of nuclear fusion plasmas, as energetic particle losses can degrade plasma performance and damage reactor components. Scintillator-based detectors are widely employed to monitor fast ions; however, existing studies often assume isotropic light emission, neglecting potential angular dependencies that can compromise the determination of ion fluxes. In this work, we investigate the angular emission properties of two commercial scintillators, TG-Green and b-SiAlON, under irradiation with 3.5 MeV He++ and 1 MeV D+ beams, representative of conditions in future fusion devices such as ITER. A novel experimental setup, combining precise optical alignment, angular scanning, and rigorous calibration, was developed to measure the detection efficiency as a function of observation angle. Prior to the characterization, stability tests demonstrated negligible radiation-induced degradation under the applied fluences, and transmission losses due to optical fiber bending were found to be below 1.5%. The results reveal a pronounced angular anisotropy in scintillation emission for both materials, with intensity decreasing as the detection angle increases, well described by an empirical cosine-based model. Additionally, the normalized response shows minimal dependence on ion species or energy. These findings improve scintillator-based diagnostics, allowing more accurate measurement of fast-ion fluxes in fusion plasmas."

Many existing uncertainty methods lack confidence calibration, are costly to run, are not distance-aware, and fail to generalize under out-of-distribution data. We introduce two distance-aware uncertainty methods for deterministic physics-guided neural networks: PG-SNGP, based on Spectral Normalization Gaussian Process, and PG-SNER, based on Deep Evidential Regression. We apply spectral normalization to the hidden layers so the network preserves distances from input to latent space. PG-SNGP replaces the final dense layer with a Gaussian Process layer for distance-sensitive uncertainty, while PG-SNER outputs Normal Inverse Gamma parameters to model uncertainty in a coherent probabilistic form. We assess performance using standard accuracy metrics and a new distance-aware metric based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, which measures how well predicted uncertainty tracks the distance between test and training samples. We also design a dynamic weighting scheme in the loss to balance data fidelity and physical consistency. We test our methods on rolling-element bearing degradation using the PRONOSTIA dataset and compare them with Monte Carlo and Deep Ensemble PGNNs. Results show that PG-SNGP and PG-SNER improve prediction accuracy, generalize reliably under OOD conditions, and remain robust to adversarial attacks and noise."

    "abstract": "Diffusion models are usually evaluated by their final outputs, gradually denoising random noise into meaningful images. Yet, generation unfolds along a trajectory, and analyzing this dynamic process is crucial for understanding how controllable, reliable, and predictable these models are in terms of their success/failure modes. In this work, we ask the question: when does noise turn into a specific concept (e.g., age) and lock in the denoising trajectory? We propose PCI (Prompt-Conditioned Intervention) to study this question. PCI is a training-free and model-agnostic framework for analyzing concept dynamics through diffusion time. The central idea is the analysis of Concept Insertion Success (CIS), defined as the probability that a concept inserted at a given timestep is preserved and reflected in the final image, offering a way to characterize the temporal dynamics of concept formation. Applied to several state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models and a broad taxonomy of concepts, PCI reveals diverse temporal behaviors across diffusion models, in which certain phases of the trajectory are more favorable to specific concepts even within the same concept type. These findings also provide actionable insights for text-driven image editing, highlighting when interventions are most effective without requiring access to model internals or training, and yielding quantitatively stronger edits that achieve a balance of semantic accuracy and content preservation than strong baselines.

In our synthesis scheme of CsPbBr3 NCs we replaced excess Pb2+ with different exogenous metal cations (M) and investigated their effect on the synthesis products. These cations can be divided into two groups: group 1 delivers monodisperse CsPbBr3 cubes capped with oleate species (as for the case when Pb2+ is used in excess) and with photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as 90% with some cations (for example with M= In3+); group 2 yields irregularly shaped CsPbBr3 NCs with broad size distributions. In both cases, the addition of a tertiary ammonium cation (didodecylmethyl ammonium, DDMA+) during the synthesis, after the nucleation of the NCs, reshapes the NCs to monodisperse truncated cubes. Such NCs feature a mixed oleate/DDMA+ surface termination with PLQY values up to 90%. For group 1 cations, this happens only if the ammonium cation is directly added as a salt (DDMA-Br) while for group 2 cations this happens even if the corresponding tertiary amine (DDMA) is added, instead of DDMA-Br. This is attributed to the fact that only group 2 cations can facilitate the protonation of DDMA by the excess oleic acid present in the reaction environment. In all cases studied, the incorporation of M cations is marginal and the reshaping of the NCs is only transient: if the reactions are run for a long time the truncated cubes evolve to cubes."

    "abstract": "This study offers new insights into students' interest in computer science (CS) education by disentangling the distinct effects of age and gender across a diverse adolescent sample. Grounded in the person-object theory of interest (POI), we conceptualize enthusiasm as a short-term, activating expression of interest that combines positive affect, perceived relevance, and intention to re-engage. Experiencing such enthusiasm can temporarily shift CS attitudes and strengthen future engagement intentions, making it a valuable lens for evaluating brief outreach activities. To capture these dynamics, we developed a theoretically grounded questionnaire for pre-post assessment of the enthusiasm potential of CS interventions. Using data from more than 400 students participating in online CS courses, we examined age- and gender-related patterns in enthusiasm. The findings challenge the prevailing belief that early exposure is the primary pathway to sustained interest in CS. Instead, we identify a marked decline in enthusiasm during early adolescence, particularly among girls, alongside substantial variability in interest trajectories across age groups. Crucially, our analyses reveal that age is a more decisive factor than gender in shaping interest development and uncover key developmental breakpoints. Despite starting with lower baseline attitudes, older students showed the largest positive changes following the intervention, suggesting that well-designed short activities can effectively re-activate interest even at later ages. Overall, the study highlights the need for a dynamic, age-sensitive framework for CS education in which instructional strategies are aligned with developmental trajectories."

The simulations employ a rate-dependent crystal plasticity constitutive model that incorporates both slip and twinning deformation mechanisms. The model accounts for the spatially non-uniform appearance of new twin-related orientations, hardening due to slip--twin interactions, and modified properties of the twinned crystal. Limited experiments on single-crystal dog-bone and single-edge notch specimens, with two crystal orientations, are also conducted to aid the simulation. Several features of the experimental observations are accurately captured in the simulations. For example, simulations accurately capture distinct stress--strain responses associated with different crystallographic orientations, including variations in initial hardening behavior followed by either decreasing or increasing hardening depending on the dominant deformation mechanisms. The simulation also captures the observed orientation-dependent asymmetric deformation of the notch in single-edge notch specimens. Additionally, by selectively activating deformation mechanisms, the role of twinning is isolated and its influence on both global and local response is clearly demonstrated. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of how deformation mode interactions and local geometry (i.e., notch) influence the response of these materials."

    "abstract": "We analyse the stability of viscoelastic Dean flow (flow of an elastic fluid through a curved two-dimensional channel, driven by an azimuthal pressure gradient) in the absence of fluid inertia. This configuration is well known to exhibit a hoop-stress-driven `purely elastic' instability (referred to henceforth as the hoop-stress mode -- `HSM') on account of the base-flow streamline curvature. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the existence and importance of a distinct elastic instability in this flow configuration, which is not driven by hoop-stresses, but instead is a continuation of a novel `centre-mode' (CM) instability recently identified in rectilinear shear flows. We use both the Oldroyd-B and FENE-P models to map out parameter regimes in the $W\\!i$--$ε$--$β$ space where the aforementioned instabilities are present. Here, $W\\!i$ is a suitably defined Weissenberg number that characterizes fluid elasticity, $β$ is the ratio of solvent to total solution viscosity, and $ε$ is the ratio of the gap (channel) width to the radius of curvature. For FENE-P model, decreasing the finite extensibility parameter $L$ has opposing effects on the HSM and CM instabilities -- stabilising the former, but destabilising the latter. In the dilute solution regime ($β> 0.95$), and for realistic values of $L \\sim O(100)$, corresponding to polymer molecular weights of $O(10^{5-6})$g/mol, the CM remains the most unstable mode for $ε\\leq 0.25$, rendering it potentially relevant to the onset of elastic turbulence in the flow of such polymer solutions through curved channels."

However, while we have ample, homogeneous data for galaxies with halo masses $M_h \\gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$ the data available for low-mass galaxies is more sparse, and both GCS mass and halo mass estimates are determined using varying methodologies. This work compiles all available literature data for dwarf galaxies with confident stellar mass and GC count estimates, and converts these estimates to GCS masses and peak halo masses using a standard conversion. This allows for a consistent comparison of these masses to be made and a complete study of the behaviour of the $M_{GCS}-M_h$ relation to be conducted. We compare the positions of classical dwarfs on the scaling relation to that of ultra diffuse galaxies and extremely low-surface brightness galaxies and find that these non-classical dwarfs have, on average, systematically higher GC specific frequencies. This also makes them, on average, systematically positively offset from the $M_{GCS}-M_h$ relation, driving much of the high-$M_{GCS}$ scatter observed."

It seamlessly enables the optimization of the steady-states pair that is not unique due to the MISO nature of the model. Anesthesia dynamics is a multi-time scale system with two types of states characterized, respectively, by fast and slow dynamics. In anesthesia control, the output equation depends only on the fast dynamics. Therefore, the slow states can be treated as disturbances, and compensation terms can be introduced. Subsequently, the system can be reformulated as a nominal one allowing the design of an MPC for tracking strategy. The presented framework ensures recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability, through the design of appropriate terminal ingredients in the MPC for tracking framework. The controller performance is then assessed on a patient in a simulation environment."

    "abstract": "The potential for rapidly-evolving frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, especially large language models (LLMs), to facilitate bioterrorism or access to biological weapons has generated significant policy, academic, and public concern. Both model developers and policymakers seek to quantify and mitigate any risk, with an important element of such efforts being the development of model benchmarks that can assess the biosecurity risk posed by a particular model. This paper, the second in a series of three, describes the second component of a novel Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) framework: the generation of the Bacterial Biothreat Benchmark (B3) dataset. The development process involved three complementary approaches: 1) web-based prompt generation, 2) red teaming, and 3) mining existing benchmark corpora, to generate over 7,000 potential benchmarks linked to the Task-Query Architecture that was developed during the first component of the project. A process of de-duplication, followed by an assessment of uplift diagnosticity, and general quality control measures, reduced the candidates to a set of 1,010 final benchmarks. This procedure ensured that these benchmarks are a) diagnostic in terms of providing uplift; b) directly relevant to biosecurity threats; and c) are aligned with a larger biosecurity architecture permitting nuanced analysis at different levels of analysis."

    "abstract": "This dissertation explores the dynamics of relativistic spaceflight, focusing on the risks associated with collisions and photon interactions as a spacecraft approaches velocities near the speed of light. The study emphasizes two primary collision types: (1) collisions with interstellar dust and particles, and (2) interactions with cosmic molecules, specifically hydrogen. Using principles of energy conservation and relativistic mechanics, the energy transfer from these collisions is calculated, showing that even small particles can impart massive energy at relativistic speeds. The dissertation also examines the impact of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, particularly its blue-shifting effect at high velocities, which influences photon interactions with the spacecraft. Additionally, the Schwinger limit, which sets an upper bound on the electromagnetic field strength for sustained relativistic travel, is discussed in the context of photon-induced pair production. Lastly, advanced photon interactions, such as Compton scattering, are analyzed for their role in thermal management and spacecraft design. The findings highlight the importance of shielding, thermal regulation, and collision avoidance strategies in the design of spacecraft for interstellar travel, offering insights into the potential challenges and solutions for achieving relativistic spaceflight."

Yet, research in this area has been limited in relation to a manifested problem in these models: gender bias. With this research, we aim to move away from simply measuring bias to exploring its origins. Working with gender-ambiguous natural source data, this study examines which context, in the form of input tokens in the source sentence, influences (or triggers) the translation model choice of a certain gender inflection in the target language. To analyse this, we use contrastive explanations and compute saliency attribution. We first address the challenge of a lacking scoring threshold and specifically examine different attribution levels of source words on the model gender decisions in the translation. We compare salient source words with human perceptions of gender and demonstrate a noticeable overlap between human perceptions and model attribution. Additionally, we provide a linguistic analysis of salient words. Our work showcases the relevance of understanding model translation decisions in terms of gender, how this compares to human decisions and that this information should be leveraged to mitigate gender bias."

    "abstract": "The original boson sampling paradigm-consisting of multiple single-photon input states, a large interferometer, and multi-channel click detection-was originally proposed as a photonic route to quantum computational advantage. Its non-Gaussian resources, essential for outperforming any classical system, are provided by single-photon inputs and click detection. Yet the drive toward larger experiments has led to the replacement of experimentally demanding single-photon sources with Gaussian states, thereby diminishing the available non-Gaussianity-a critical quantum resource. As the community broadens its focus from the initial sampling task to possible real-world applications, it becomes crucial to quantify the performance cost associated with reducing non-Gaussian resources and to benchmark sampling platforms that employ different input states. To address this need, we introduce the Paderborn Quantum Sampler (PaQS), a hybrid platform capable of performing sampling experiments with eight Gaussian or non-Gaussian input states in a 12-mode interferometer within a single experimental run. This architecture enables direct, side-by-side benchmarking of distinct sampling regimes under otherwise identical conditions. By employing a semi-device-independent framework, offering certification that does not rely on prior knowledge of the interferometer or the input states, we verify that the observed data cannot be reproduced by any classical model-a prerequisite for demonstrating quantum advantage. Applying this framework, we observe clear performance gains arising from non-Gaussian input states."

In the continuous-variable regime, non-Gaussian entangled resources have been shown theoretically to improve teleportation fidelity compared to Gaussian squeezed vacuum. We experimentally demonstrate a heralded two-mode resource state for non-Gaussian teleportation capable of real-time use. We characterize this state with two-mode homodyne tomography showing it has fidelity $F=0.973\\pm 0.005$ with the expected resource state. Real-time use is enabled by a photon-subtraction orchestrator system performing live coincidence detection and outputting low-jitter and low-latency heralding signals. Live collection of real-time quadrature measurements of photon-subtracted states is enabled by the development of a synchronized homodyne detection server where the orchestrator system queries to collect the real-time quadrature samples corresponding to the heralded state. These results demonstrate significant advancement in enabling the use of heralded non-Gaussian states in quantum networking protocols, especially in the context of quantum repeaters, non-Gaussian quantum sensing and measurement-based quantum computing."

    "abstract": "The brain-skull interface (meninges) plays a critical role in governing brain motion during head impacts, yet computational models often simplify this interface using idealized contact conditions due to limited experimental data. This study presents an improved protocol combining experimental testing and computational modelling to determine the mechanical properties of the brain-skull interface under shear loading. Brain tissue and brain-skull complex samples were extracted from sheep cadaver heads and subjected to shear loading. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to obtain accurate 3D geometries of the samples, which were then used to create computational grids (meshes) for simulation of the experiments using finite element (FE) models to determine subject-specific properties of the brain tissue and brain-skull interface. A second-order Ogden hyperelastic model was used for the brain tissue, and a cohesive layer was employed to model the brain-skull interface. Our results indicate that a cohesive layer captures the force-displacement and damage initiation of the brain-skull interface. The calibrated cohesive properties showed consistent patterns across samples, with maximum normal tractions ranging from 2.8-3.4 kPa and maximum tangential tractions from 1.8-2.1 kPa. This framework provides a foundation for improving the biofidelity of computational head models used in injury prediction and neurosurgical planning by replacing arbitrary boundary conditions with formulations derived from experimental data on brain-skull interface (meninges) biomechanical behaviour."

However, the excitation processes of OH remain poorly characterized. We provide a new set of collisional rate coefficients for OH with H$_2$, expanding the existing data to $j$ levels up to $j=15/2$ and temperatures up to 750 K. These rate coefficients are obtained from state-to-state collision cross sections calculated by means of well-converged close-coupling quantum scattering calculations for collisions of OH with para- and ortho-H$_2$ with energies up to 1700 cm$^{-1}$ ($\\simeq 2450$ K). We reproduce the rate coefficients computed by Klos et al. (2017) and extend their results to higher temperatures and higher rotational levels of OH. The de-excitation rate coefficients are lower in collisions with para-H$_2$ ($j_{\\rm H_2} = 0$) due to the absence of a quadrupole moment, but this difference decreases at higher temperatures. We find that the rate coefficients follow scaling relations with the energy gap between the upper and lower levels of a given transition, which allows extrapolation to higher OH rotational states $j_{\\rm OH}$. As a first application, we show that under astrophysical conditions typical of warm and dense gas around nascent stars, the populations of low-$j_{\\rm OH}$ states are dominated by collisions, even when chemical pumping is included. The full set of rate coefficients is made available in the LAMDA database."

    "abstract": "Model-based planning in robotic domains is fundamentally challenged by the hybrid nature of physical dynamics, where continuous motion is punctuated by discrete events such as contacts and impacts. Conventional latent world models typically employ monolithic neural networks that enforce global continuity, inevitably over-smoothing the distinct dynamic modes (e.g., sticking vs. sliding, flight vs. stance). For a planner, this smoothing results in catastrophic compounding errors during long-horizon lookaheads, rendering the search process unreliable at physical boundaries. To address this, we introduce the Prismatic World Model (PRISM-WM), a structured architecture designed to decompose complex hybrid dynamics into composable primitives. PRISM-WM leverages a context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework where a gating mechanism implicitly identifies the current physical mode, and specialized experts predict the associated transition dynamics. We further introduce a latent orthogonalization objective to ensure expert diversity, effectively preventing mode collapse. By accurately modeling the sharp mode transitions in system dynamics, PRISM-WM significantly reduces rollout drift. Extensive experiments on challenging continuous control benchmarks, including high-dimensional humanoids and diverse multi-task settings, demonstrate that PRISM-WM provides a superior high-fidelity substrate for trajectory optimization algorithms (e.g., TD-MPC), proving its potential as a powerful foundational model for next-generation model-based agents."

The method appends a reset segment with tailored amplitude and phase to a normal square readout pulse. Within the linear-response regime, the optimal reset amplitude scales proportionally with the readout amplitude, while the optimal reset phase remains nearly invariant, significantly simplifying the calibration process. By characterizing the cavity photons dynamics, we show that the SSPE pulse accelerates photon depletion by up to a factor of six compared to passive free decay. We further quantify the qubit backaction induced by the readout pulse and find that the SSPE pulse yields the lowest excitation and relaxation rates compared to a Square and CLEAR pulses. Our results establish the SSPE scheme as a practical and scalable approach for achieving fast, smooth, low-backaction cavity reset in superconducting quantum circuits."

We prove that this placement probability is always equal to $1/4$ plus a rational function, whose shape depends on the location of the domino, multiplied by a position-independent factor that involves only the size of the diamond.

Free energy analysis revealed that successful unwinding via high-entropy, stand-displacing intermediates. Furthermore, we introduced Entropy-Unet, a deep learning framework for entropy prediction, which corroborated theoretical estimates and uncovered a hierarchical pattern of entropy contributions.

    "abstract": "The open and broadcast nature of wireless communication systems, while enabling ubiquitous connectivity, also exposes them to jamming attacks that may critically compromise network performance or disrupt service availability. The proliferation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) introduces a new dimension to this threat, as UAVs can act as mobile, intelligent jammers capable of launching sophisticated attacks by leveraging Line-of-Sight (LoS) channels and adaptive strategies. This paper addresses a critical challenge of countering intelligent UAV jamming in the context of energy-constrained ambient backscatter communication systems. Traditional anti-jamming techniques often fall short against such dynamic threats or are unsuitable for low-power backscatter devices. Hence, we propose a novel anti-jamming framework based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) that empowers the transmitter to not only defend against but also strategically exploit the UAV's jamming signals. In particular, our approach allows the transmitter to learn an optimal policy for switching between active transmission, energy harvesting from the jamming signal, and backscattering information using the jammer's own emissions. We then formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employ a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to derive the optimal operational strategy. Simulation results demonstrate that our DQN-based method significantly outperforms conventional Q-learning in convergence speed and surpasses a greedy anti-jamming strategy in terms of average throughput, packet loss rate, and packet delivery ratio."

    "abstract": "The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) is a key geotechnical indicator used to assess the load-bearing capacity of subgrade soils, especially in transportation infrastructure and foundation design. Traditional CBR determination relies on laboratory penetration tests. Despite their accuracy, these tests are often time-consuming, costly, and can be impractical, particularly for large-scale or diverse soil profiles. Recent progress in artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML), has enabled data-driven approaches for modeling complex soil behavior with greater speed and precision. This study introduces a comprehensive ML framework for CBR prediction using a dataset of 382 soil samples collected from various geoclimatic regions in Türkiye. The dataset includes physicochemical soil properties relevant to bearing capacity, allowing multidimensional feature representation in a supervised learning context. Twelve ML algorithms were tested, including decision tree, random forest, extra trees, gradient boosting, xgboost, k-nearest neighbors, support vector regression, multi-layer perceptron, adaboost, bagging, voting, and stacking regressors. Each model was trained, validated, and evaluated to assess its generalization and robustness. Among them, the random forest regressor performed the best, achieving strong R2 scores of 0.95 (training), 0.76 (validation), and 0.83 (test). These outcomes highlight the model's powerful nonlinear mapping ability, making it a promising tool for predictive geotechnical tasks. The study supports the integration of intelligent, data-centric models in geotechnical engineering, offering an effective alternative to traditional methods and promoting digital transformation in infrastructure analysis and design."

However, they still fall short on new tasks not covered in the training data. When finetuned on limited demonstrations of a new task, these policies often overfit to the specific demonstrations--not only losing their prior abilities to solve a wide variety of generalist tasks but also failing to generalize within the new task itself. In this work, we aim to develop a method that preserves the generalization capabilities of the generalist policy during finetuning, allowing a single policy to robustly incorporate a new skill into its repertoire. Our goal is a single policy that both learns to generalize to variations of the new task and retains the broad competencies gained from pretraining. We show that this can be achieved through a simple yet effective strategy: interpolating the weights of a finetuned model with that of the pretrained model. We show, across extensive simulated and real-world experiments, that such model merging produces a single model that inherits the generalist abilities of the base model and learns to solve the new task robustly, outperforming both the pretrained and finetuned model on out-of-distribution variations of the new task. Moreover, we show that model merging enables continual acquisition of new skills in a lifelong learning setting, without sacrificing previously learned generalist abilities."

While their empirical effectiveness is known, the internal structure, detectability, and representational behavior of these perturbations remain poorly understood. This study provides a systematic, explainable AI analysis using a unified framework that integrates white-box feature-space inspection and black-box signal-level probing. Through latent-space clustering, feature-channel activation analysis, occlusion-based spatial sensitivity mapping, and frequency-domain characterization, we show that protection mechanisms operate as structured, low-entropy perturbations tightly coupled to underlying image content across representational, spatial, and spectral domains. Protected images preserve content-driven feature organization with protection-specific substructure rather than inducing global representational drift. Detectability is governed by interacting effects of perturbation entropy, spatial deployment, and frequency alignment, with sequential protection amplifying detectable structure rather than suppressing it. Frequency-domain analysis shows that Glaze and Nightshade redistribute energy along dominant image-aligned frequency axes rather than introducing diffuse noise. These findings indicate that contemporary image protection operates through structured feature-level deformation rather than semantic dislocation, explaining why protection signals remain visually subtle yet consistently detectable. This work advances the interpretability of adversarial image protection and informs the design of future defenses and detection strategies for generative AI systems."

Inspired by the success of quaternion data modeling for color images in image recovery and denoising tasks, we propose a novel classification method for color image classification, named as the Low-rank Support Quaternion Matrix Machine (LSQMM), in which the RGB channels are treated as pure quaternions to effectively preserve the intrinsic coupling relationships among channels via the quaternion algebra. For the purpose of promoting low-rank structures resulting from strongly correlated color channels, a quaternion nuclear norm regularization term, serving as a natural extension of the conventional matrix nuclear norm to the quaternion domain, is added to the hinge loss in our LSQMM model. An Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based iterative algorithm is designed to effectively resolve the proposed quaternion optimization model. Experimental results on multiple color image classification datasets demonstrate that our proposed classification approach exhibits advantages in classification accuracy, robustness and computational efficiency, compared to several state-of-the-art methods using support vector machines, support matrix machines, and support tensor machines."

    "abstract": "Video Motion Magnification (VMM) amplifies subtle macroscopic motions to a perceptible level. Recently, existing mainstream Eulerian approaches address amplification-induced noise via decoupling representation learning such as texture, shape and frequancey schemes, but they still struggle to separate photon noise from true micro-motion when motion displacements are very small. We propose GeoDiffMM, a novel diffusion-based Lagrangian VMM framework conditioned on optical flow as a geometric cue, enabling structurally consistent motion magnification. Specifically, we design a Noise-free Optical Flow Augmentation strategy that synthesizes diverse nonrigid motion fields without photon noise as supervision, helping the model learn more accurate geometry-aware optial flow and generalize better. Next, we develop a Diffusion Motion Magnifier that conditions the denoising process on (i) optical flow as a geometry prior and (ii) a learnable magnification factor controlling magnitude, thereby selectively amplifying motion components consistent with scene semantics and structure while suppressing content-irrelevant perturbations. Finally, we perform Flow-based Video Synthesis to map the amplified motion back to the image domain with high fidelity. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets show that GeoDiffMM outperforms state-of-the-art methods and significantly improves motion magnification."

Their precise identification enables advanced diagnostics, facilitates personalized treatment strategies, and supports more effective monitoring of treatment progress in clinical dentistry. However, several significant challenges may arise due to the intricate geometry of individual teeth and the substantial variations observed across different individuals. To address these complexities, the development of advanced techniques, especially through the application of deep learning, is essential for the precise and reliable detection of 3D tooth landmarks. In this context, the 3DTeethLand challenge was held in collaboration with the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) in 2024, calling for algorithms focused on teeth landmark detection from intraoral 3D scans. This challenge introduced the first publicly available dataset for 3D teeth landmark detection, offering a valuable resource to assess the state-of-the-art methods in this task and encourage the community to provide methodological contributions towards the resolution of their problem with significant clinical implications."

We regard these categories as a family over an affine space, introduce a stratification on this parameter space, and formulate conjectures on the structural constancy of fibers on each stratum. Using the theory of $\\mathfrak{sl}_{\\mathbb{Z}}$-categorification, we prove these conjectures for admissible strata. Namely, we axiomatize the notion of multi-Fock tensor product categorifications (MFTPCs), which are interval finite highest weight categories equipped with a compatible action of commuting copies of $\\mathfrak{sl}_{\\mathbb{Z}}$, categorifying an external tensor product of tensor products of highest and lowest weight Fock space representations. We prove a uniqueness theorem for admissible MFTPCs and show that complex rank parabolic categories O have the structure of MFTPCs. In turn, for suitable choices of parameters, we produce an equivalence of complex rank category O with a stable limit of classical parabolic categories O, resolving our conjecture in the admissible case. These equivalences yield multiplicities of simple objects in Verma modules in terms of stable parabolic Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials, answering a question posed by Etingof. In particular, for the case of two Levi blocks of non-integral size, we completely describe the structure of the corresponding category O in terms of stable representation theory. As an application, we obtain multiplicities for parabolic analogs of hyperalgebra Verma modules introduced by Haboush in the large rank and large characteristic limit."

While recent studies have demonstrated the potential of such attacks, they typically rely on impractical assumptions, such as white-box access or known user queries, thereby underestimating the difficulty of real-world exploitation. In this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing MIRAGE, a novel multi-stage poisoning pipeline designed for strict black-box and query-agnostic environments. Operating on surrogate model feedback, MIRAGE functions as an automated optimization framework that integrates three key mechanisms: it utilizes persona-driven query synthesis to approximate latent user search distributions, employs semantic anchoring to imperceptibly embed these intents for high retrieval visibility, and leverages an adversarial variant of Test-Time Preference Optimization (TPO) to maximize persuasion. To rigorously evaluate this threat, we construct a new benchmark derived from three long-form, domain-specific datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIRAGE significantly outperforms existing baselines in both attack efficacy and stealthiness, exhibiting remarkable transferability across diverse retriever-LLM configurations and highlighting the urgent need for robust defense strategies."

We present Physics-Aware Video-to-Audio Synthesis (PAVAS), a method that incorporates physical reasoning into a latent diffusion-based V2A generation through the Physics-Driven Audio Adapter (Phy-Adapter). The adapter receives object-level physical parameters estimated by the Physical Parameter Estimator (PPE), which uses a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to infer the moving-object mass and a segmentation-based dynamic 3D reconstruction module to recover its motion trajectory for velocity computation. These physical cues enable the model to synthesize sounds that reflect underlying physical factors. To assess physical realism, we curate VGG-Impact, a benchmark focusing on object-object interactions, and introduce Audio-Physics Correlation Coefficient (APCC), an evaluation metric that measures consistency between physical and auditory attributes. Comprehensive experiments show that PAVAS produces physically plausible and perceptually coherent audio, outperforming existing V2A models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

    "abstract": "Accurate and reliable aircraft landing time prediction is essential for effective resource allocation in air traffic management. However, the inherent uncertainty of aircraft trajectories and traffic flows poses significant challenges to both prediction accuracy and trustworthiness. Therefore, prediction models should not only provide point estimates of aircraft landing times but also the uncertainties associated with these predictions. Furthermore, aircraft trajectories are frequently influenced by the presence of nearby aircraft through air traffic control interventions such as radar vectoring. Consequently, landing time prediction models must account for multi-agent interactions in the airspace. In this work, we propose a probabilistic multi-agent aircraft landing time prediction framework that provides the landing times of multiple aircraft as distributions. We evaluate the proposed framework using an air traffic surveillance dataset collected from the terminal airspace of the Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher prediction accuracy than the baselines and quantifies the associated uncertainties of its outcomes. In addition, the model uncovered underlying patterns in air traffic control through its attention scores, thereby enhancing explainability."

    "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are a rich source of structured, heterogeneous data, powering a wide range of applications. A common approach to leverage this data is to train a graph neural network (GNN) on the KG. However, existing message-passing GNNs struggle to scale to large KGs because they rely on the iterative message passing process to learn the graph structure, which is inefficient, especially under mini-batch training, where a node sees only a partial view of its neighborhood. In this paper, we address this problem and present gHAWK, a novel and scalable GNN training framework for large KGs. The key idea is to precompute structural features for each node that capture its local and global structure before GNN training even begins. Specifically, gHAWK introduces a preprocessing step that computes: (a)~Bloom filters to compactly encode local neighborhood structure, and (b)~TransE embeddings to represent each node's global position in the graph. These features are then fused with any domain-specific features (e.g., text embeddings), producing a node feature vector that can be incorporated into any GNN technique. By augmenting message-passing training with structural priors, gHAWK significantly reduces memory usage, accelerates convergence, and improves model accuracy. Extensive experiments on large datasets from the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) demonstrate that gHAWK achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and lower training time on both node property prediction and link prediction tasks, topping the OGB leaderboard for three graphs."

This research introduces Generative Agents as a means to tackle these challenges. These agents can rapidly and cost-effectively evaluate AI-generated content, simulating human judgment by rating aspects such as coherence, interestingness, clarity, fairness, and relevance. By incorporating these agents, businesses can streamline content generation and ensure consistent, high-quality output while minimizing reliance on costly human evaluations.

Furthermore, for learning global dependencies, Swin Transformer blocks are customized using internal residual pathways, which reinforce gradient stability, refine local patterns, and facilitate global feature fusion. Formerly, for enhancing tissue continuity, ultrasound noise suppressions, and accentuating fine structural transitions Laplacian-of-Gaussian regional operator is applied, and for maintaining the morphological integrity of malignant lesion contours, a boundary-oriented operator has been incorporated. Subsequently, a contraction strategy was applied stage-wise by progressively reducing features-map progressively for capturing scale invariance and enhancing the robustness of structural variability. In addition, each decoder level prior augmentation integrates a new Multi-Scale Channel Attention and Squeezing (MSCAS) module. The MSCAS selectively emphasizes encoder salient maps, retains discriminative global context, and complementary local structures with minimal computational cost while suppressing redundant activations. Finally, the Pixel-Attention module encodes class-relevant spatial cues by adaptively weighing malignant lesion pixels while suppressing background interference. The Residual-SwinCA-Net and existing CNNs/ViTs techniques have been implemented on the publicly available BUSI dataset. The proposed Residual-SwinCA-Net framework outperformed and achieved 99.29% mean accuracy, 98.74% IoU, and 0.9041 Dice for breast lesion segmentation. The proposed Residual-SwinCA-Net framework improves the BUSI lesion diagnostic performance and strengthens timely clinical decision-making."

Causal models and especially causal learning have proved to be difficult for large pretrained models using standard techniques of deep learning. In contrast, cognitive scientists have applied advances in our formal understanding of causation in computer science, particularly within the Causal Bayes Net formalism, to understand human causal learning. In the very different tradition of reinforcement learning, researchers have described an intrinsic reward signal called \"empowerment\" which maximizes mutual information between actions and their outcomes. \"Empowerment\" may be an important bridge between classical Bayesian causal learning and reinforcement learning and may help to characterize causal learning in humans and enable it in machines. If an agent learns an accurate causal world model, they will necessarily increase their empowerment, and increasing empowerment will lead to a more accurate causal world model. Empowerment may also explain distinctive features of childrens causal learning, as well as providing a more tractable computational account of how that learning is possible. In an empirical study, we systematically test how children and adults use cues to empowerment to infer causal relations, and design effective causal interventions."

Yet a critical question remains: is such reasoning genuinely grounded in visual evidence and logically coherent? Existing benchmarks emphasize generation but neglect verification, i.e., the capacity to assess whether a reasoning chain is both visually consistent and logically valid. To fill this gap, we introduce MM-CoT, a diagnostic benchmark specifically designed to probe the visual grounding and logical coherence of CoT reasoning in MMs. Instead of generating free-form explanations, models must select the sole event chain that satisfies two orthogonal constraints: (i) visual consistency, ensuring all steps are anchored in observable evidence, and (ii) logical coherence, ensuring causal and commonsense validity. Adversarial distractors are engineered to violate one of these constraints, exposing distinct reasoning failures. We evaluate leading vision-language models on MM-CoT and find that even the most advanced systems struggle, revealing a sharp discrepancy between generative fluency and true reasoning fidelity. MM-CoT shows low correlation with existing benchmarks, confirming that it measures a unique combination of visual grounding and logical reasoning. This benchmark provides a foundation for developing future models that reason not just plausibly, but faithfully and coherently within the visual world."

We calculate the quasipotential analytically to first order in nonreciprocality. We characterise it along a one-dimensional reaction coordinate that connects the attractors, and we also obtain the full two-dimensional landscape, at leading order in perturbation theory. The resulting landscapes feature flat regions and extended plateaus, together with non-differentiable switching lines. These singular structures arise from two geometric mechanisms: the handover of dominance between competing transition paths, and the competition between basins of attraction. The system provides a rare case where the geometry of nonequilibrium rare events can be fully resolved, and a simple analytically tractable example of a quasipotential in more than one coordinate that captures a rich set of nonequilibrium features."

We propose an on-device framework. First, we characterise the gap between state-of-the-art Animal Re-ID models and MCU-class hardware, showing that straightforward knowledge distillation from large teachers offers limited benefit once memory and input resolution are constrained. Second, guided by this analysis, we design a high-accuracy Animal Re-ID architecture by systematically scaling a CNN-based MobileNetV2 backbone for low-resolution inputs. Third, we evaluate the framework with a real-world dataset and introduce a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy to enable fast adaptation with just three images per animal identity at a new site. Across six public Animal Re-ID datasets, our compact model achieves competitive retrieval accuracy while reducing model size by over two orders of magnitude. On a self-collected cattle dataset, the deployed model performs fully on-device inference with only a small accuracy drop and unchanged Top-1 accuracy relative to its cluster version.

    "abstract": "This paper primarily investigates the geometric properties of excursions of Lévy processes reflected at the past infimum with long lifetime or large height. For an oscillating process in the domain of attraction of a stable law, our results state that excursions with a long lifetime need not have a large height. After a suitable scaling, they behave like stable excursions with lifetime or height greater than one. These extend the related results in Doney and Rivero [Prob. Theory Relat. Fields, 157(1) (2013) 1-45]. In contrast, for the negative-drift case we prove that under a heavy-tailed condition, long lifetime and large height are asymptotically equivalent. Conditioned on either event, excursions converge under spatial scaling to a single-jump process with Pareto-distributed jump size and size-biased jump time. Moreover, after a suitable time rescaling, the effect of the negative drift becomes apparent."

    "abstract": "In this work, we develop a protocol for learning a time-independent Lindblad model for operations that can be applied repeatedly on a quantum computer. The protocol is highly scalable for models with local interactions and is in principle insensitive to state-preparation errors. At its core, the protocol forms a linear system of equations for the model parameters in terms of a set of observable values and their gradients. The required gradient information is obtained by fitting time-series data with sums of exponentially damped sinusoids and differentiating those curves. We develop a robust curve-fitting procedure that finds the most parsimonious representation of the data up to shot noise. We demonstrate the approach by learning the Lindbladian for a full layer of gates on a 156-qubit superconducting quantum processor, providing the first learning experiment of this kind. We study the effects of state-preparation and measurement errors and limitations on the operations that can be learned. For improved performance under readout errors, we propose an optional fine-tuning strategy that improves the fit between the time-evolved model and the measured data."

    "abstract": "Gravito-inertial-mode asteroseismology of intermediate-mass main-sequence stars took off with the 5-month uninterrupted light curves of the CoRoT space mission. It was developed in detail from the 4-year-long Kepler light curves, which provided a practical means to measure the rotation frequency in the transition layer between the convective core and the radiative envelope, where the local buoyancy frequency reaches a maximum. Recently, a new buoyancy glitch inversion method based on the Fourier spectra of gravity-mode period spacings was developed to probe that region further (Guo 2025). We aim to exploit the information contained in the variability of gravity-mode period spacings ($ΔP$) in Slowly Pulsating B (SPB) stars with rotation. We investigate how well the main-sequence evolutionary stage can be inferred from this variability. We extract the frequency and amplitude of the variability in $ΔP$ from the Fourier spectrum (FT). Both the period spacing $ΔP$ and its periodic perturbations $δP$ (deviations from their asymptotic values) are used. The measured dominant frequency of $ΔP$ allows us to infer the central hydrogen mass fraction, $X_c$, which is a main-sequence age indicator. The inferred $X_c$ values from $FT(ΔP)$ mostly agree with previous results reported in the literature based on forward modelling of individual identified mode frequencies. We find that the buoyancy glitches $δN/N$ in SPB stars are generally less than $2\\%$ in amplitude. Ensemble asteroseismic modeling of gravity-mode pulsators can now be carried out efficiently with our novel $FT(ΔP)$ method once the internal rotation rate of the pulsators is known. Our methodology offers a fast method for gravito-inertial asteroseismic applications in the era of ongoing and future space-based observations."

Consequently, the current flowing through the GAA transistor depends on the qubit's state. We calculated the current-voltage characteristics of the three-dimensional configurations of the qubit and GAA structures, using technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations. Moreover, we performed circuit simulations using the Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) to investigate whether a readout circuit made from complementary metal--oxide semiconductor (CMOS) transistors can amplify the weak signals generated by the qubits. Our findings indicate that, by dynamically controlling the applied voltage within a properly designed circuit, the readout can be detected effectively based on a conventional sense amplifier."

Through combined experiment and simulation, we demonstrated and analyzed the enhancement of hole mobility in p-type monolayer $WSe_{2}$ field effect transistors (FETs) under biaxial compression. We tracked FET performance versus strain by incrementing compressive strain to $WSe_{2}$ channels via sequential AlOx deposition and performing intermediate photoluminescence and transport measurements. The hole mobility factor increased at a rate of 340 $\\pm$ 95 %/%$ε$, and the on-current factor increased at a rate of 460 $\\pm$ 340 %/%$ε$. Simulation revealed that the enhancement under compression arises primarily from a reduction in inter-valley scattering between the $Γ$--K valence bands, and the rate is robust against variations in carrier density, impurity density, or dielectric environment. These findings show that compressive strain is a powerful technique for enhancing performance in 2D p-FETs and that it is multiplicative with defect and doping engineering."

This, in addition to the masking of small subgroup averages in publicly available assessment data, poses challenges for evaluating interventions aimed at closing achievement gaps. We introduce propensity score estimates designed to achieve balance on subgroup average true scores. These estimates are available even when noisy measurements are not and improve overlap compared to those that ignore measurement error, leading to greater bias reduction of matching estimators. We demonstrate our methods through simulation and an application to a statewide initiative in Texas for curbing summer learning loss."

Starting with the former, we introduce the notion of a robust equilibrium as those equilibria that remain invariant to small -- but otherwise arbitrary -- perturbations to the game's payoff structure, and we provide a crisp geometric characterization thereof. Subsequently, we turn to the question of dynamic robustness, and we examine which equilibria may arise as stable limit points of the dynamics of \"follow the regularized leader\" (FTRL) in the presence of randomness and uncertainty. Despite their very distinct origins, we establish a structural correspondence between these two notions of robustness: strategic robustness implies dynamic robustness, and, conversely, the requirement of strategic robustness cannot be relaxed if dynamic robustness is to be maintained. Finally, we examine the rate of convergence to robust equilibria as a function of the underlying regularizer, and we show that entropically regularized learning converges at a geometric rate in games with affinely constrained action spaces."

Two identical copies of the unknown quantum field illuminate laterally displaced slits, guaranteeing perfect spatiotemporal mode matching without a separate local oscillator. In the far-field, detection at transverse position $x$ is associated with a relative slit phase $φ(x)$, and an $N$-photon event projects the detected quantum field onto a state $|N;φ(x)\\rangle$. The resulting distribution $P(N,φ)$ is the quantum analogue of a Frequency Resolved Optical Gating (FROG) trace: whereas FROG reconstructs the classical complex spectral field $E(ω)$ from a spectrally resolved second harmonic of a pulse with its delayed self, our measurement reconstructs the Fock-space wavefunction or density matrix from binomially weighted self-interference. The scheme requires no known or mode-matched reference and is compatible with commercially available photon-number-resolving cameras. Beyond conceptual simplicity and automatic mode matching, the FROG analogy permits direct transfer of mature ultrafast-optics methodologies (e.g., mixed-state, ptychographic, and vectorial extensions) into quantum optics, offering a versatile route to tomography of quantum photon states."

Such hydrides were first proposed by N. W. Ashcroft in 1968, because hydrogen-rich materials possess elevated vibrational frequencies due to the low atomic mass of hydrogen. This article presents a self-consistent solution to the Eliashberg equations for analysing superconductivity in hydrides, contrasting with the commonly used McMillan-Allen-Dynes parameterized formula. We also analyse effects of the electron-phonon spectral function and the broadening parameters arising from phonon lifetime and sample imperfections on the superconducting critical temperature. Finally, both theoretical approaches are applied to a typical metal hydride superconductor, and the reliability of self-consistent solutions is validated against the experimentally measured critical temperature."

As a result, LRPOP can solve low-rank polynomial optimization problems that are far beyond the reach of existing sparse hierarchies. In particular, we solve problems with up to thousands of variables with total degree in the thousands. Numerical conditioning for problems of this size is improved by using the Bernstein basis. The LRPOP hierarchy converges from below to the global minimum of the polynomial under standard assumptions."

    "abstract": "Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright millisecond radio pulses. Their origin is still unknown in the field of astronomy. A notable distinction among FRBs is that some sources repeat, while others appear to be non-repeating events. Interestingly, repeating FRBs tend to exhibit broader temporal widths and narrower spectral bandwidths compared to non-repeat events, suggesting they may arise from different physical mechanisms. However, current radio telescopes have limited coverage and sensitivity, which hinders a complete survey with continuous long-term monitoring. This issue makes it difficult to confirm repeat activity and potentially leads to misclassification of repeaters as non-repeaters; these are referred to as repeater candidates. To address this, machine learning techniques have emerged as a useful tool for classifying distinct FRB types in previous studies. In this study, we utilize the CHIME/FRB baseband catalog with three orders of magnitude better time resolution than the intensity catalog. Measured fluences are available in the baseband catalog, while only upper limits are reported in the intensity catalog. We apply machine learning to the baseband catalog to evaluate classification outcomes. We identify 15 repeater candidates among 122 non-repeating FRBs in the baseband catalog. Additionally, our classification identifies 31 sources previously categorized as repeater candidates as non-repeaters, highlighting a significant difference from the prior work. Of these repeater candidates, 14 overlap with previous findings, while 1 is newly identified in this work. Notably, one of our candidates was confirmed as a repeater by CHIME/FRB. Follow-up observations for the 14 candidates are highly encouraged."

    "abstract": "Gravitational waves (GWs) are powerful probes of new physics in the early Universe. In particular, GWs induced by primordial isocurvature perturbations encode information of novel dynamics beyond the standard $Λ$CDM model. Existing studies of isocurvature induced GWs focus on a particular type: cold dark matter (CDM) isocurvature. In this work, we present a more comprehensive study of four kinds of isocurvature involving CDM, baryons, neutrinos and free-streaming dark radiation (DR). We first reformulate initial conditions of isocurvature with coupled neutrinos because modes relevant for observations at Pulsar Timing Arrays enter the horizon before neutrino decoupling. With these new initial conditions, neutrino isocurvature is phenomenologically similar to CDM isocurvature up to an overall coefficient, which leads to an interesting conversion of isocurvature between radiation and matter sectors. We then find that the spectrum of isocurvature induced GWs from free-streaming DR is qualitatively different than that from CDM due to the presence of anisotropic stress. Unlike GWs induced by CDM isocurvature that are suppressed at high frequencies due to matter density being suppressed at early times, DR isocurvature induced GWs is proportional to the constant ratio between DR density and total radiation. Finally, we utilize two general parametrizations of the isocurvature power spectrum: a delta function and a broken power law, and derive novel constraints with recent NANOGrav data. Our results set stringent constraints on isocurvature around $10^{6}\\,\\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, which are complementary to cosmological observations at large scales."

However, the reversal transition between different types of Weyl modes in a single material, which is of particular interest in the fundamental research in Weyl physics and potential application in spintronics, is scarcely achieved due to restriction of inborn symmetry in crystals. Here, by tuning the direction and strength of magnetic field in an ideal Dirac semimetal, Bi4(Br0.27I0.73)4, we report the realization of multiple Weyl modes, including gapped Weyl mode, Weyl nodal ring, and coupled Weyl mode by the magnetoresistivity measurements and electronic structure calculations. Specifically, under a magnetic field with broken mirror symmetry, anomalous Hall effect with step feature results from the large Berry curvature for the gapped Weyl mode. A prominent negative magnetoresistivity is observed at low magnetic field with preserved mirror symmetry and disappears at high magnetic field, which is correlated to the chiral anomaly and its annihilation of Weyl nodal ring, respectively. Our findings reveal distinct Weyl modes under the intertwined crystal symmetry and time-reversal breaking, laying the foundation of manipulating multiple Weyl modes in chiral spintronic network."

Using silicon as a test case, we validate the method against coupled-cluster, FCIQMC, and diffusion Monte Carlo benchmarks for bulk. Then we apply TC embedding to calculation of formation energies of two silicon self-interstitials.

(Multi-party) delegated private set intersection (D-PSI) is a privacy-enhancing technology to link data across multiple data providers using a data collector. However, before it can be deployed in these use cases, it needs to be enhanced with additional functions, e.g., securely delivering payload only for elements in the intersection. Although there has been recent progress in the communication and computation requirements of D-PSI, these practical obstacles have not yet been addressed. This paper is the result of a collaboration with a governmental organization responsible for collecting, linking, and pseudonymizing data. Based on their requirements, we design a new D-PSI protocol with composable output functions, including encrypted payload and pseudonymized identifiers. We show that our protocol is secure in the standard model against colluding semi-honest data providers and against a non-colluding, possibly malicious independent party, the data collector.

    "abstract": "The slow creep of glacial ice plays a key role in sea-level rise, yet its transient deformation remains poorly understood. Glen's flow law, where strain rate is simply a function of stress, cannot predict the time-dependent creep behavior observed in experiments. Here we present a physics-based rheological model that captures all three regimes of transient creep in polycrystalline ice. The key components of the model are a series of Kelvin-Voigt mechanical elements that produce a power-law (Andrade) creep, and a single viscous element with microstructure and stress dependence that represents reorientation in the polycrystalline grains. The interplay between these components produces a minimum in the strain rate at approximately 1% strain, which is a universal but unexplained feature reported in experiments. Due to its transient nature, the model exhibits fractional power-law exponents in the stress dependence of the strain rate minimum, which has been conventionally interpreted as independent physical processes. Taken together, we provide a compact, mechanistic framework for transient ice rheology that generalizes to other polycrystalline materials and can be integrated into constitutive laws for ice-sheet models."

The global minimum variance (GMV) quadratic estimator for CMB lensing reduces reconstruction noise over the standard quadratic estimator (SQE). In this work, we extend the GMV framework to incorporate the tSZ-deproj and cross-ILC foreground mitigation techniques, which enhance robustness against contamination from astrophysical sources. For SPT-3G Ext-10k and SO Extended at $\\ell_{\\mathrm{max}}^T = 3500$, the lensing bias at $L < 1000$ is reduced from $\\sim4\\%$ with standard GMV and SQE to $2\\%$ with tSZ-deproj, and to $< 1\\%$ with cross-ILC. These methods enable the construction of foreground-cleaned lensing maps suitable for cross-correlation analyses, with direct relevance for current and future surveys."

    "abstract": "Nested virtualization is now widely supported by major cloud vendors, allowing users to leverage virtualization-based technologies in the cloud. However, supporting nested virtualization significantly increases host hypervisor complexity and introduces a new attack surface in cloud platforms. While many prior studies have explored hypervisor fuzzing, none has explicitly addressed nested virtualization due to the challenge of generating effective virtual machine (VM) instances with a vast state space as fuzzing inputs. We present NecoFuzz, the first fuzzing framework that systematically targets nested virtualization-specific logic in hypervisors. NecoFuzz synthesizes executable fuzz-harness VMs with internal states near the boundary between valid and invalid, guided by an approximate model of hardware-assisted virtualization specifications. Since vulnerabilities in nested virtualization often stem from incorrect handling of unexpected VM states, this specification-guided, boundary-oriented generation significantly improves coverage of security-critical code across different hypervisors. We implemented NecoFuzz on Intel VT-x and AMD-V by extending AFL++ to support fuzz-harness VMs. NecoFuzz achieved 84.7% and 74.2% code coverage for nested virtualization-specific code on Intel VT-x and AMD-V, respectively, and uncovered six previously unknown vulnerabilities across three hypervisors, including two assigned CVEs."

This approach provides a direct lattice extension of the well-established $S$-duality between the sine-Gordon and Thirring models, thereby bridging the gap between continuum dualities and their lattice counterparts. By constructing the quantum chiral-soliton operators explicitly, we show how their unconventional dynamics appear in the excitation spectrum and correlation functions across the full Brillouin zone. A key result is that the dominant soliton tunneling amplitude alternates in sign, $\\operatorname{sgn}(t_{1+}) = (-1)^{2S+1}$, sharply distinguishing half-odd-integer from integer spin chains. We further identify characteristic signatures of these chiral excitations in the dynamical spin structure factor, demonstrating their visibility in inelastic neutron scattering. Our results open a route to experimentally probing non-perturbative features of dual quantum field theories in condensed-matter settings."

Key biological mechanisms--including chemotaxis, haptotaxis, recruitment, logistic growth, and natural degradation of normal cells--along with other primary components (cancer cells, vitronectin, uPA, uPAI-1 and plasmin) are modeled via a continuum framework of cancer cell invasion of the extracellular matrix. The resulting model constitutes a strongly coupled, cross-diffusion hybrid system of differential equations. The primary mathematical challenges arise from the strongly coupled cross-diffusion terms, the parabolic operators of divergence form, and the interaction between the cross-diffusion fluxes and the ODE components. We address these by deriving several a priori estimates for dimensions d less or equal to 3. Subsequently, we employ a decoupling strategy to split the system into proper sub-problems, establishing the existence (and uniqueness) for each subsystem. Finally, we demonstrate the global existence and uniqueness of the solution for dimensions d less or equal to 2 and the global existence of a solution for dimension d = 3."

We introduce OSMO, an open-source wearable tactile glove designed for human-to-robot skill transfer. The glove features 12 three-axis tactile sensors across the fingertips and palm and is designed to be compatible with state-of-the-art hand-tracking methods for in-the-wild data collection. We demonstrate that a robot policy trained exclusively on human demonstrations collected with OSMO, without any real robot data, is capable of executing a challenging contact-rich manipulation task. By equipping both the human and the robot with the same glove, OSMO minimizes the visual and tactile embodiment gap, enabling the transfer of continuous shear and normal force feedback while avoiding the need for image inpainting or other vision-based force inference. On a real-world wiping task requiring sustained contact pressure, our tactile-aware policy achieves a 72% success rate, outperforming vision-only baselines by eliminating contact-related failure modes.

    "abstract": "Watermarks are an essential tool for identifying AI-generated content. Recently, Christ and Gunn (CRYPTO '24) introduced pseudorandom error-correcting codes (PRCs), which are equivalent to watermarks with strong robustness and quality guarantees. A PRC is a pseudorandom encryption scheme whose decryption algorithm tolerates a high rate of errors. Pseudorandomness ensures quality preservation of the watermark, and error tolerance of decryption translates to the watermark's ability to withstand modification of the content. In the short time since the introduction of PRCs, several works (NeurIPS '24, RANDOM '25, STOC '25) have proposed new constructions. Curiously, all of these constructions are vulnerable to quasipolynomial-time distinguishing attacks. Furthermore, all lack robustness to edits over a constant-sized alphabet, which is necessary for a meaningfully robust LLM watermark. Lastly, they lack robustness to adversaries who know the watermarking detection key. Until now, it was not clear whether any of these properties was achievable individually, let alone together. We construct pseudorandom codes that achieve all of the above: plausible subexponential pseudorandomness security, robustness to worst-case edits over a binary alphabet, and robustness against even computationally unbounded adversaries that have the detection key. Pseudorandomness rests on a new assumption that we formalize, the permuted codes conjecture, which states that a distribution of permuted noisy codewords is pseudorandom. We show that this conjecture is implied by the permuted puzzles conjecture used previously to construct doubly efficient private information retrieval. To give further evidence, we show that the conjecture holds against a broad class of simple distinguishers, including read-once branching programs."

The equations are formulated for components of the Maxwell field relative to the algebraically special frame of Kerr, with the unknowns treated as tensorial quantities associated with a non-integrable horizontal distribution. The extremal Maxwell components decouple into Teukolsky equations, whereas the middle Maxwell components form a coupled system of transport and elliptic equations. Assuming control over the extremal components, we prove uniform boundedness (without loss of derivatives) and decay estimates for the middle components in the full |a|<=M range of spacetime parameters. Our analysis relies on (i) deriving a decoupled system of transport and elliptic equations for two modified middle Maxwell components and (ii) decomposing general solutions into a dynamical and stationary part, the latter determined by two real (electric and magnetic) charges which are entirely read off from the initial data at the event horizon. In the sub-extremal |a|<M case, works of Shlapentokh-Rothman and the second author provide the necessary control over the extremal components, yielding unconditional boundedness and decay results for all the unknowns in the equations. In the extremal |a|=M case, we formulate a conjectural boundedness and decay statement for the extremal components, motivated by work of Casals, Gralla and Zimmerman on fixed azimuthal mode solutions compactly supported away from the event horizon. Our boundedness and decay results for all the unknowns in the equations remain, therefore, conditional. We show that the complicated dynamics of the extremal components at the event horizon is inherited by the middle components; in particular, we uncover novel conservation laws for the middle components of axisymmetric solutions."

Classical methods like Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) exhibit variable performance across noise models and suffer from polynomial complexity, while tensor network decoders achieve high accuracy but at prohibitively high computational cost. Recent neural decoders reduce complexity but lack the accuracy needed to compete with computationally expensive classical methods. We introduce SAQ-Decoder, a unified framework combining transformer-based learning with constraint aware post-processing that achieves both near Maximum Likelihood (ML) accuracy and linear computational scalability with respect to the syndrome size. Our approach combines a dual-stream transformer architecture that processes syndromes and logical information with asymmetric attention patterns, and a novel differentiable logical loss that directly optimizes Logical Error Rates (LER) through smooth approximations over finite fields. SAQ-Decoder achieves near-optimal performance, with error thresholds of 10.99% (independent noise) and 18.6% (depolarizing noise) on toric codes that approach the ML bounds of 11.0% and 18.9% while outperforming existing neural and classical baselines in accuracy, complexity, and parameter efficiency. Our findings establish that learned decoders can simultaneously achieve competitive decoding accuracy and computational efficiency, addressing key requirements for practical fault-tolerant quantum computing systems."

To measure this cosmological signal, the Dark-ages EXplorer (DEX) has been proposed as a compact, grid-based radio array on the lunar farside. The minimal design consists of a 32 $\\times$ 32 array of 3-m dipole antennas, operating in the $7 - 50$ MHz band. A practical challenge on the lunar surface is that the antennas may get displaced from their intended positions due to deployment imprecisions and non-coplanarity arising from local surface undulations. We present, for the first time, an end-to-end simulation pipeline, called SPADE-21cm, that integrates a sky model with a DA 21-cm signal model simulated in the lunar frame and incorporating lunar topography data. We study the effects of both lateral (xy) and vertical (z) offsets on the two-dimensional power spectra across the $7 - 12$ MHz and $30 - 35$ MHz spectral windows, with tolerance thresholds derived only for the latter. Our results show that positional offsets bias the power spectrum by $10 - 30$ per cent relative to the expected 21-cm power spectrum during DA. Lateral offsets within $σ_{xy}/λ\\lesssim 0.027$ (at 32.5 MHz) keep the fraction of Fourier modes with strong contamination (> 50 per cent of the signal) to less than 1 per cent, whereas vertical height offsets affect a larger fraction.

Our \"fast beamspace transformation\" forms $B$ beams from $M$ sensor outputs using a number of operations per sample that scales linearly (to within logarithmic factors) with $M$ when $B\\sim M$. While the narrowband version of this transformation can be performed efficiently with a spatial fast Fourier transform, the broadband setting requires coherent processing of multiple array snapshots simultaneously. Our algorithm works by taking $N$ samples off of each of $M$ sensors and encoding the sensor outputs into a set of coefficients using a special non-uniform spaced Fourier transform. From these coefficients, each beam is formed by solving a small system of equations that has Toeplitz structure. The total runtime complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(M\\log N+B\\log N)$ operations per sample, exhibiting essentially the same scaling as in the narrowband case and vastly outperforming broadband beamformers based on delay and sum whose computations scale as $\\mathcal{O}(MB)$. Alongside a careful mathematical formulation and analysis of our fast broadband beamspace transform, we provide a host of numerical experiments demonstrating the algorithm's favorable computational scaling and high accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate how tasks such as interpolating to ``off-grid\" angles and nulling an interferer are more computationally efficient when performed directly in beamspace."

To address this, the proposed SOLI (Siamese-Driven Optimization for Low-Resolution Image Latent Embedding in Image Captioning) approach presents a solution specifically designed for lightweight, low-resolution images captioning. It employs a Siamese network architecture to optimize latent embeddings, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the image-to-text translation process.

Contacts with this quality are formed by two separate fabrication schemes: (i) metal-first patterning, and (ii) lift-off with an oxygen asher descum prior to metal deposition. Given the low threading dislocation density in the single-crystal AlN substrate used for epitaxy, the smooth morphology of the contacted epitaxial surface, and the non-alloyed nature of the contacts, this contact resistivity is attributed purely to thermionic field emission through the metal-semiconductor junction. Contact resistivity extraction at low current injection enables us to model these results using a thermionic field-emission model of contact resistivity, yielding a barrier height for Ti/Al$_{0.71}$Ga$_{0.29}$N of $(0.81\\pm0.02)$ eV."

Regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA impose strict controls on data handling, making it difficult to balance the need for insights with privacy requirements. Synthetic data offers a promising solution by creating artificial datasets that reflect real patterns without exposing sensitive information. However, traditional synthetic data methods often fail to capture complex, implicit rules that link different elements of the data and are essential in domains like healthcare. They may reproduce explicit patterns but overlook domain-specific constraints that are not directly stated yet crucial for realism and utility. For example, prescription guidelines that restrict certain medications for specific conditions or prevent harmful drug interactions may not appear explicitly in the original data. Synthetic data generated without these implicit rules can lead to medically inappropriate or unrealistic profiles. To address this gap, we propose ContextGAN, a Context-Aware Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network that integrates domain-specific rules through a constraint matrix encoding both explicit and implicit knowledge. The constraint-aware discriminator evaluates synthetic data against these rules to ensure adherence to domain constraints, while differential privacy protects sensitive details from the original data. We validate ContextGAN across healthcare, security, and finance, showing that it produces high-quality synthetic data that respects domain rules and preserves privacy. Our results demonstrate that ContextGAN improves realism and utility by enforcing domain constraints, making it suitable for applications that require compliance with both explicit patterns and implicit rules under strict privacy guarantees."

However, transmitting raw sensor data to a centralized server for machine learning (ML) model training raises serious privacy and security concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising alternative by enabling decentralized model training without exposing sensitive local data. Yet, applying FL in underground mining presents unique challenges: (i) Adversaries may eavesdrop on shared model updates to launch model inversion or membership inference attacks, compromising data privacy and operational safety; (ii) Non-IID data distributions across mines and sensor noise can hinder model convergence. To address these issues, we propose FedMining--a privacy-preserving FL framework tailored for underground mining. FedMining introduces two core innovations: (1) a Decentralized Functional Encryption (DFE) scheme that keeps local models encrypted, thwarting unauthorized access and inference attacks; and (2) a balancing aggregation mechanism to mitigate data heterogeneity and enhance convergence. Evaluations on real-world mining datasets demonstrate FedMining's ability to safeguard privacy while maintaining high model accuracy and achieving rapid convergence with reduced communication and computation overhead. These advantages make FedMining both secure and practical for real-time underground safety monitoring."

Using germanium as a critical test case, we challenge the ability of both functionals to capture semiconductor properties. Although HSE improves PBE's gap error, it fails to reproduce germanium's correct $Γ$-L indirect and $Γ$-$Γ$ band gaps simultaneously. Noting that the PBE underestimated energy separation between the 4p valence-band maximum and 4s conduction-band minimum causes unphysical $sp$ mixing, we propose DFT+$α$, a semi-empirical correction scheme applied selectively to 4s-like orbitals. For germanium, DFT+$α$ restores the proper ordering and orbital character of the band edges and yields accurate lattice constant, bulk modulus, elastic constants and phonon frequencies at a fraction of hybrid-functional computational cost."

However, the ubiquity of consent banners and popups has led to widespread consent fatigue and questions regarding the effectiveness of these mechanisms in protecting users' data. In contrast, users in California and other US jurisdictions can utilize Global Privacy Control (GPC), a browser-based privacy signal that automatically broadcasts a legally binding opt-out request to websites. In this paper we explore whether, and to what extent, GPC can be adapted to the EU legal framework to mitigate consent fatigue and improve privacy protections for EU residents. We analyse GPC as a technical specification standardized at the World Wide Web Consortium and examine its standing under current EU data protection law. Generally, GPC can be mapped to the various legal bases for processing under the GDPR. However, our evaluation also identifies friction between the GPC specification and EU data protection law as it stands. These discrepancies are resolvable and present an opportunity for EU legislators and regulators to interpret GPC in alignment with EU data protection requirements, particularly, considering the European Commission's recent Digital Omnibus proposal. We conclude that while GPC is not a silver bullet, its adoption -- supported by clear authoritative guidance and specification updates -- can offer a pragmatic path toward more automated and effective data protection in the EU."

We illustrate this point, both in simple two-state and three-state systems in which TD($λ$)--starting from an optimal policy--converges to a sub-optimal policy, and also in backgammon. We then present a modified form of TD($λ$), called STD($λ$), in which function approximators are trained with respect to relative state values on binary decision problems. A theoretical analysis, including a proof of monotonic policy improvement for STD($λ$) in the context of the two-state system, is presented, along with a comparison with Bertsekas' differential training method [1]. This is followed by successful demonstrations of STD($λ$) on the two-state system and a variation on the well known acrobot problem."

    "abstract": "Although general-purpose AI systems offer transformational opportunities in science and industry, they simultaneously raise critical concerns about safety, misuse, and potential loss of control. Despite these risks, methods for assessing and managing them remain underdeveloped. Effective risk management requires systematic modeling to characterize potential harms, as emphasized in frameworks such as the EU General-Purpose AI Code of Practice. This paper advances the risk modeling component of AI risk management by introducing a methodology that integrates scenario building with quantitative risk estimation, drawing on established approaches from other high-risk industries. Our methodology models risks through a six-step process: (1) defining risk scenarios, (2) decomposing them into quantifiable parameters, (3) quantifying baseline risk without AI models, (4) identifying key risk indicators such as benchmarks, (5) mapping these indicators to model parameters to estimate LLM uplift, and (6) aggregating individual parameters into risk estimates that enable concrete claims (e.g., X% probability of >\\$Y in annual cyber damages). We examine the choices that underlie our methodology throughout the article, with discussions of strengths, limitations, and implications for future research. Our methodology is designed to be applicable to key systemic AI risks, including cyber offense, biological weapon development, harmful manipulation, and loss-of-control, and is validated through extensive application in LLM-enabled cyber offense. Detailed empirical results and cyber-specific insights are presented in a companion paper."

    "abstract": "With the increasing reliance on AI models for weather forecasting, it is imperative to evaluate their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. This work introduces Weather Adaptive Adversarial Perturbation Optimization (WAAPO), a novel framework for generating targeted adversarial perturbations that are both effective in manipulating forecasts and stealthy to avoid detection. WAAPO achieves this by incorporating constraints for channel sparsity, spatial localization, and smoothness, ensuring that perturbations remain physically realistic and imperceptible. Using the ERA5 dataset and FourCastNet (Pathak et al. 2022), we demonstrate WAAPO's ability to generate adversarial trajectories that align closely with predefined targets, even under constrained conditions. Our experiments highlight critical vulnerabilities in AI-driven forecasting models, where small perturbations to initial conditions can result in significant deviations in predicted weather patterns. These findings underscore the need for robust safeguards to protect against adversarial exploitation in operational forecasting systems."

Thus far, however, a mechanistic understanding of these gains has been missing. In this work, we establish a connection to recent work showing that layers in the second half of non-grown, pre-layernorm Transformers contribute much less to the final output distribution than those in the first half - also known as the Curse of Depth (Sun et al., 2025, Csordás et al., 2025). Using depth-wise analyses, we demonstrate that growth via gradual middle stacking yields more effective utilization of model depth, alters the residual stream structure, and facilitates the formation of permutable computational blocks. In addition, we propose a lightweight modification of MIDAS that yields further improvements in downstream reasoning benchmarks. Overall, this work highlights how the gradual growth of model depth can lead to the formation of distinct computational circuits and overcome the limited depth utilization seen in standard non-grown models."

We investigate this trade-off in a scenario where a team must balance area patrolling with locating an anomalous radio signal. To address this trade-off, we evaluate both behavioral heterogeneity through agent role specialization (\"patrollers\" and \"searchers\") and sensing heterogeneity (i.e., only the searchers can sense the radio signal). Through simulation, we identify the Pareto-optimal trade-offs under varying team compositions, with behaviorally heterogeneous teams demonstrating the most balanced trade-offs in the majority of cases. When sensing capability is restricted, heterogeneous teams with half of the sensing-capable agents perform comparably to homogeneous teams, providing cost-saving rationale for restricting sensor payload deployment. Our findings demonstrate that pre-deployment role and sensing specialization are powerful design considerations for multi-robot systems facing time-conflicting tasks, where varying the degree of behavioral heterogeneity can tune system performance toward either task."

In jazz, musicians often improvise across predefined chord progressions (leadsheets). How do we assess the creativity of jazz improvisations? And can we capture this in automated metrics for creativity for current LLM-based generative systems? Demonstration of emotional involvement is closely linked with creativity in improvisation. Analysing musical audio, can we detect emotional involvement? This study hypothesises that if an improvisation contains more evidence of emotion-laden content, it is more likely to be recognised as creative. An embeddings-based method is proposed for capturing the emotional content in musical improvisations, using a psychologically-grounded classification of musical characteristics associated with emotions. Resulting 'emovectors' are analysed to test the above hypothesis, comparing across multiple improvisations. Capturing emotional content in this quantifiable way can contribute towards new metrics for creativity evaluation that can be applied at scale."

    "abstract": "There are several excesses of events in current LHC data, yet not exceeding the level of significance which would make them to be considered as firm. They point to the possibility of the presence of a new Higgs particle in the spectrum, in addition to the already observed 125 GeV state. In particular, there are excesses involving a diphoton resonance at invariant masses of about 95 GeV, 152 GeV and 650 GeV and an extra scalar might accompany the recent observation of a toponium at a mass of about 350 GeV. Several interpretations of these excesses have been attempted in extensions of the Standard Model. In this paper, we aim to explain them in the framework of a two Higgs doublet model supplemented by a relatively light pseudoscalar Higgs boson $a$ which would correspond to the putative resonance in most cases. This realistic 2HD+a scenario is attractive as it is has the virtue to pass all experimental constraints from high-precision experiments and collider searches and, at the same time, to allow for a viable explanation of the dark matter in the universe. We first update the present constraints on the model, in particular taking into account the latest results on dark matter and Higgs searches, as well the high-precision measurements, including those from Higgs and flavor physics. We then show that the additional Higgs states with the proper mass spectrum and adjusted couplings to fermions, would explain all the LHC excesses (but individually) while passing the former experimental constraints as well as the theoretical ones."

    "abstract": "Quantum communication offers many applications, with teleportation and superdense coding being two of the most fundamental. In these protocols, pre-shared entanglement enables either the faithful transfer of quantum states or the transmission of more information than is possible classically. However, channel losses degrade the shared states, reducing teleportation fidelity and the information advantage in superdense coding. Here, we investigate how to mitigate these effects by optimising the measurements applied by the communicating parties. We formulate the problem as an optimisation over general positive operator-valued measurements (POVMs) and compare the results with physically realisable noiseless attenuation (NA) and noiseless linear amplification (NLA) circuits. For teleportation, NLA/NA and optimised POVMs improve the average fidelity by up to 78% while maintaining feasible success probabilities. For superdense coding, they enhance the quantum advantage over the classical channel capacity by more than 100% in some regimes and shift the break-even point, thereby extending the tolerable range of losses. Notably, the optimal POVMs effectively reduce to NA or NLA, showing that simple, experimentally accessible operations already capture the essential performance gains."

We devise algorithms that are simple and similar to each other while having the same upper bounds. The common features of these algorithms is the use of the Matrix-Tree theorem and sieving using roots of unity. Next, we use the framework to provide alternative algorithms to count perfect matchings in bipartite graphs on $n$ vertices, i.e., computing the $\\{0,1\\}$-permanent of a square $n/2 \\times n/2$ matrix which runs in a time similar to Ryser. We demonstrate the flexibility of our method by counting the number of ways to vertex partition the graph into $k$-stars (a $k$-star consist of a tree with a root having $k-1$ children that are all leaves). Interestingly, our running time improves to $O^*((1+ε_k)^n)$ with $ε_k \\rightarrow 0$ as $k \\rightarrow \\infty$. As an aside, making use of Björklund's algorithm for exact counting perfect matchings in general graphs, we show that the count of maximum matchings can be computed in time $O^*(2^ν)$ where $ν$ is the size of a maximum matching. The crucial ingredient here is the famous Gallai-Edmonds decomposition theorem. All our algorithms run in polynomial space."

Using broadband photospheric images obtained with the Visible Broadband Imager at the National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), the properties of BPs have been analyzed with DKIST for the first time at the highest spatial resolutions achievable. BPs were observed to have an average lifetime of 95$\\pm$29 s and a mean transverse velocity of 1.60$\\pm$0.41 km/s. The BPs had a log-normal area distribution with a peak at 2300 km$^2$. Transverse velocity and lifetimes across the DKIST images were comparable and consistent with previous studies. The area distribution of the DKIST data peaked in areas significantly lower than those from the literature. This was explored further and was observed to be due to an overestimation of BP areas due to the merging of close features when the spatial resolution is reduced, in tandem with possible over-splitting of features in the DKIST images. Furthermore, the effect of variable seeing within the data was determined. This showed that the average spatial resolution of the data was around 0.''034$\\pm$0.''007 in comparison to the theoretical diffraction-limit of 0.''022. Accounting for the influence of seeing, the peak of the area distribution of BPs in the DKIST data was estimated as 4800 km$^2$, which is still significantly lower than previously observed."

In this way, it gives an immediate proof of the physicality of the boundary $θ$-term. This makes the essence of the strong-$CP$ puzzle very transparent and offers a solution in form of the gauge axion, which has exact quality. This axion represents an intrinsic part of the QCD gauge redundancy without any reference to an anomalous global symmetry. It is a two-form transforming under the QCD gauge symmetry. Due to its pure gauge nature, the gauge axion represents a powerful tool to monitor physics of $θ$-vacua in various regimes. Unlike the ordinary Peccei-Quinn axion, which is UV-completed into a Goldstone phase of a complex scalar and thereby suffers from the quality problem, the gauge axion is UV-completed directly into a fundamental theory of gravity. We study the domain wall and string structure of the gauge axion and show that the strings sourcing it must be a part of this fundamental theory. We thus observe that the absence of the axion quality problem motivates the presence of fundamental strings. This provides a new argument for a connection between the axion and gravity."

A noise-robust wrapped-number search is used to select per-pixel integer pairs (k1, k2), and a global refinement with circular TV regularization and soft bounds improves stability and preserves height discontinuities. The approach is validated through rigorous scattering-model-based simulations and experiments on structured silicon samples, demonstrating accurate height recovery in regimes where single-wavelength FPT exhibits phase wrapping. We analyze the limits of the FPT forward model and identify aspect ratio (AR) and phase modulation transfer function (ph-MTF) as key predictors of reconstruction fidelity. Simulations and experiments show that increasing AR beyond a practical threshold causes loss of high-frequency phase transfer and destabilizes dual-wavelength unwrapping. Within this AR range, dual-wavelength FPT provides robust, high-resolution topography suitable for semiconductor and industrial metrology."

By analyzing the high-frequency electromagnetic response of these rotating fluctuation Cooper pairs above the second critical field in superconducting film, we predict a pronounced and measurable enhancement in the imaginary part of the ac-conductivity arising directly from quantum fluctuations. This enhancement is expected to occur at characteristic frequencies $ω_{QF} \\sim \\hbar^{-1}Δ(H-H_{c2})/H_{c2}$, which are well below the superconducting threshold at $2\\hbar^{-1}Δ$, where a similar increase in imaginary conductivity occurs in the superconducting phase.

This added generality is useful because it intuitively allows one to encode situations where we have representables without boundaries or with multiple boundaries at once. In particular, the relational generalization of precubical sets has natural application to modeling concurrency. In this article, we study categories of relational presheaves, and construct realization functors for those. We begin by observing that they form the category of set-based models of a cartesian theory, which implies in particular that they are locally finitely presentable categories. By using general results from categorical logic, we then show that the realization of such presheaves in a cocomplete category is a model of the theory in the opposite category, which allows characterizing situations in which we have a realization functor. Finally, we explain that our work has applications in the semantics of concurrency theory. The realization namely allows one to compare syntactic constructions on relational presheaves and geometric ones. Thanks to it, we are able to provide a syntactic counterpart of the blowup operation, which was recently introduced by Haucourt on directed geometric semantics, as way of turning a directed space into a manifold."

    "abstract": "Diffusion inversion aims to recover the initial noise corresponding to a given image such that this noise can reconstruct the original image through the denoising diffusion process. The key component of diffusion inversion is to minimize errors at each inversion step, thereby mitigating cumulative inaccuracies. Recently, fixed-point iteration has emerged as a widely adopted approach to minimize reconstruction errors at each inversion step. However, it suffers from high computational costs due to its iterative nature and the complexity of hyperparameter selection. To address these issues, we propose an iteration-free fixed-point estimator for diffusion inversion. First, we derive an explicit expression of the fixed point from an ideal inversion step. Unfortunately, it inherently contains an unknown data prediction error. Building upon this, we introduce the error approximation, which uses the calculable error from the previous inversion step to approximate the unknown error at the current inversion step. This yields a calculable, approximate expression for the fixed point, which is an unbiased estimator characterized by low variance, as shown by our theoretical analysis. We evaluate reconstruction performance on two text-image datasets, NOCAPS and MS-COCO. Compared to DDIM inversion and other inversion methods based on the fixed-point iteration, our method achieves consistent and superior performance in reconstruction tasks without additional iterations or training."

    "abstract": "We experimentally demonstrate laser-induced vortex shock waves formed by carbon nanotubes drilling optical fibers for the first time. Three samples of standard single-mode optical fibers (SMF) are sequentially inserted in a syringe loaded with a 1 mL solution of single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) and methanol, and a high-power laser is injected into the fibers for 5 (SMF 1), 10 (SMF 2), and 20 (SMF 3) minutes. The CNT solution thermally expands and generates vortex acoustic flows, which are confined in the syringe cavity, significantly increasing the velocity and impact of nanotubes at the fiber tip. The resulting shock waves achieve estimated hypersonic velocities (5742 m/s) and high pressures (6.7 GPa), overcoming the silica tensile strength and ablating structured vortices in the fibers. The material, geometry, and depth profile of the vortices are characterized, providing details of mixing carbon and silica layers, increasing radially from the fiber core center and in thickness to the cladding for longer laser periods (850 nm to 10 micron thickness). The cross-sections of the measured vortices are compared to analytical simulations, revealing unprecedented Fibonacci helices drilling holes in the fiber core with a 5 micron maximum depth, while depositing nanoscale CNT-silica layers following Fibonacci spirals. These achievements point out a new route for laser-controlled deposition of nanoparticles and fabrication of vortex devices on fiber tips, which is promising for all-fiber vortex spatial phase modulators in optical communications, fiber sensors, high-power pulsed fiber lasers, and biomedical ultrasonic neurotransmitters."

In this first paper, we focus on Proxima Centauri, leveraging archival and recent HST observations in point-source imaging mode. We refine the geometric-distortion calibration of the HST detector used, and develop a robust methodology to derive high-precision astrometric parameters by combining HST measurements with the Gaia DR3 catalog. We determine Proxima's position, proper motion, and parallax with uncertainties at the $\\sim$0.4-mas, 50-$μ$as yr$^{-1}$, and 0.2-mas level, respectively, achieving consistent results with what measured by Gaia within $\\sim$1$σ$. We further investigate the presence of the candidate exoplanet Proxima c by analyzing the proper-motion anomaly derived from combining long-term HST-based and short-term Gaia astrometry. Under the assumption of a circular, face-on orbit, we obtain an estimated mass of $m_c = 3.4^{+5.2}_{-3.4}$ $M_\\odot$, broadly consistent with radial-velocity constraints but limited by our current uncertainties. These results establish the foundation for the next phase of ARES, which will exploit HST spatial-scanning observations to achieve astrometric precisions of a few tens of $μ$as and enable a direct search for astrometric signatures of low-mass companions."

    "abstract": "GUI grounding, which translates natural language instructions into precise pixel coordinates, is essential for developing practical GUI agents. However, we observe that existing grounding models exhibit significant coordinate prediction instability, minor visual perturbations (e.g. cropping a few pixels) can drastically alter predictions, flipping results between correct and incorrect. This instability severely undermines model performance, especially for samples with high-resolution and small UI elements. To address this issue, we propose Multi-View Prediction (MVP), a training-free framework that enhances grounding performance through multi-view inference. Our key insight is that while single-view predictions may be unstable, aggregating predictions from multiple carefully cropped views can effectively distinguish correct coordinates from outliers. MVP comprises two components: (1) Attention-Guided View Proposal, which derives diverse views guided by instruction-to-image attention scores, and (2) Multi-Coordinates Clustering, which ensembles predictions by selecting the centroid of the densest spatial cluster. Extensive experiments demonstrate MVP's effectiveness across various models and benchmarks. Notably, on ScreenSpot-Pro, MVP boosts UI-TARS-1.5-7B to 56.1%, GTA1-7B to 61.7%, Qwen3VL-8B-Instruct to 65.3%, and Qwen3VL-32B-Instruct to 74.0%.

    "abstract": "In many new physics models with extended gauge symmetry, the new gauge boson $Z'$ could mediate the interactions between the dark matter and standard model particles. For the conventional $Z^\\prime$ portal dark matter, the collider and the direct detection constraints typically pose a significant challenge. To address this pressing issue, we present in this paper a new benchmark model based on the gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, which introduces a Dirac dark fermion $\\tildeχ_1$ and a heavier partner $\\tildeχ_2$ with zero and nonzero $U(1)_{B-L}$ charge, respectively. Including the mass term $δm \\bar{\\tildeχ}_1\\tildeχ_2$ results in the dark fermions $χ_1$ and $χ_2$ in the mass eigenstate, where the lighter one $χ_1$ is regarded as the dark matter candidate. Various intriguing processes for the relic density arise with the compressed mass spectrum $m_{χ_1}\\simeq m_{χ_2}$, such as the coscattering $χ_2f\\toχ_1f$, the conversion $χ_2χ_i\\toχ_1χ_j$, and the coannihilation $χ_1χ_2\\to f\\bar{f}$ processes. Suppressed by the small mixing angle $θ$ between the dark fermions, the small effective gauge coupling of dark matter $χ_1$ to the gauge boson $Z'$ is one distinct feature of this model, rendering phenomenology in many aspects more promising. In this paper, we investigate the production of dark matter through new mechanisms within the frameworks of resonance and secluded scenarios. The impacts of phenomenological constraints from collider, dark matter, and cosmology are also taken into account. We report that the conversion mechanism is both favored by the resonance and secluded scenarios under current constraints."

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has become a versatile tool for analyzing anomalous diffusion trajectories, yet most existing pipelines are trained on large collections of simulated data. In contrast, experimental trajectories, such as those from single-particle tracking (SPT), are typically scarce and may differ substantially from the idealized models used for simulation, leading to degradation or even breakdown of performance when ML methods are applied to real data. To address this mismatch, we introduce a wavelet-based representation of anomalous diffusion that enables data-efficient learning directly from experimental recordings. This representation is constructed by applying six complementary wavelet families to each trajectory and combining the resulting wavelet modulus scalograms. We first evaluate the wavelet representation on simulated trajectories from the andi-datasets benchmark, where it clearly outperforms both feature-based and trajectory-based methods with as few as 1000 training trajectories and still retains an advantage on large training sets. We then use this representation to learn directly from experimental SPT trajectories of fluorescent beads diffusing in F-actin networks, where the wavelet representation remains superior to existing alternatives for both diffusion-exponent regression and mesh-size classification. In particular, when predicting the diffusion exponents of experimental trajectories, a model trained on 1200 experimental tracks using the wavelet representation achieves significantly lower errors than state-of-the-art deep learning models trained purely on $10^6$ simulated trajectories. We associate this data efficiency with the emergence of distinct scale fingerprints disentangling underlying diffusion mechanisms in the wavelet spectra."

    "abstract": "Why do local actions and exponential Euclidean weights arise so universally in classical, statistical, and quantum theories? We offer a structural explanation from minimal constraints on finite descriptions of admissible histories. Assume that histories admit finite, self-delimiting (prefix-free) generative codes that can be decoded sequentially in a single forward pass. These purely syntactic requirements define a minimal descriptive cost, interpretable as a smoothed minimal program length, that is additive over local segments. First, any continuous local additive cost whose stationary sector coincides with the empirically identified classical variational sector is forced into a unique Euler--Lagrange equivalence class. Hence the universal form of an action is fixed by descriptional structure alone, while the specific microscopic Lagrangian and couplings remain system-dependent semantic input. Second, independently of microscopic stochasticity, finite prefix-free languages exhibit exponential redundancy: many distinct programs encode the same coarse history, and this redundancy induces a universal exponential multiplicity weight on histories. Requiring this weight to be real and bounded below selects a real Euclidean representative for stable local bosonic systems, yielding the standard Euclidean path-integral form. When Osterwalder--Schrader reflection positivity holds, the Euclidean measure reconstructs a unitary Lorentzian amplitude."

Our OCCDiff combines a latent diffusion process with a function autoencoder architecture to generate continuous occupancy functions evaluable at arbitrary locations. Moreover, a point encoder is proposed to provide condition features to diffusion learning, constraint the final occupancy prediction for occupancy decoder, and insert multi-modal features for latent generation to latent encoder. To further enhance the model performance, a multi-task training strategy is employed, ensuring that the point encoder learns diverse and robust feature representations.

    "abstract": "Video data is more cost-effective than motion capture data for learning 3D character motion controllers, yet synthesizing realistic and diverse behaviors directly from videos remains challenging. Previous approaches typically rely on off-the-shelf motion reconstruction techniques to obtain 3D trajectories for physics-based imitation. These reconstruction methods struggle with generalizability, as they either require 3D training data (potentially scarce) or fail to produce physically plausible poses, hindering their application to challenging scenarios like human-object interaction (HOI) or non-human characters. We tackle this challenge by introducing Mimic2DM, a novel motion imitation framework that learns the control policy directly and solely from widely available 2D keypoint trajectories extracted from videos. By minimizing the reprojection error, we train a general single-view 2D motion tracking policy capable of following arbitrary 2D reference motions in physics simulation, using only 2D motion data. The policy, when trained on diverse 2D motions captured from different or slightly different viewpoints, can further acquire 3D motion tracking capabilities by aggregating multiple views. Moreover, we develop a transformer-based autoregressive 2D motion generator and integrate it into a hierarchical control framework, where the generator produces high-quality 2D reference trajectories to guide the tracking policy. We show that the proposed approach is versatile and can effectively learn to synthesize physically plausible and diverse motions across a range of domains, including dancing, soccer dribbling, and animal movements, without any reliance on explicit 3D motion data.

While on-the-fly extensions of 3DGS have shown promise for real-time reconstruction from monocular RGB streams, they often fail to achieve complete 3D coverage due to the limited field of view (FOV). Employing a multi-camera rig fundamentally addresses this limitation. In this paper, we present the first on-the-fly 3D reconstruction framework for multi-camera rigs. Our method incrementally fuses dense RGB streams from multiple overlapping cameras into a unified Gaussian representation, achieving drift-free trajectory estimation and efficient online reconstruction. We propose a hierarchical camera initialization scheme that enables coarse inter-camera alignment without calibration, followed by a lightweight multi-camera bundle adjustment that stabilizes trajectories while maintaining real-time performance. Furthermore, we introduce a redundancy-free Gaussian sampling strategy and a frequency-aware optimization scheduler to reduce the number of Gaussian primitives and the required optimization iterations, thereby maintaining both efficiency and reconstruction fidelity. Our method reconstructs hundreds of meters of 3D scenes within just 2 minutes using only raw multi-camera video streams, demonstrating unprecedented speed, robustness, and Fidelity for on-the-fly 3D scene reconstruction."

Solving the Helmholtz equation in this context can be very costly and the simulation depends on the given distribution of particles. To circumvent this, we propose, via a multi-scale asymptotic expansion of the solution, an effective model where the layer of particles is replaced by an equivalent boundary condition. The coefficients that appear in this equivalent boundary condition depend on the solutions to corrector problems of Laplace type defined on unbounded random domains. Under the assumption that the particles are distributed given a stationary and mixing random point process, we prove that those problems admit a unique solution in the proper space. We then establish quantitative error estimates for the effec tive model and present numerical simulations that illustrate our theoretical results."

In this paper, we propose a novel Global Budget Allocation attack strategy. Leveraging the theoretical insight that a sample's influence on value function convergence is proportional to its Temporal Difference (TD) error, we formulate the attack as a global resource allocation problem. We derive a closed-form solution where perturbation magnitudes are assigned proportional to the TD-error sensitivity under a global L2 constraint. Empirical results on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline strategies, achieving up to 80% performance degradation with minimal perturbations that evade detection by state-of-the-art statistical and spectral defenses."

This event is synchronized with the sharp decay, within less than half a day, of a prominent soft X-ray/UV flare. Accounting for the look-elsewhere effect, the XRISM Resolve data alone indicate a low probability of 2e-5 that this UFO detection is due to random chance. The UFO features narrow H-like and He-like Fe lines with a velocity dispersion of 1000 km/s, suggesting that it originates from a dense clump. Beyond this primary detection, there are hints of weaker outflow signatures throughout the rise and fall phases of the soft flare. Their velocities increase from 0.05c to 0.3c over approximately three days, and they may be associated with a larger stream in which the clump is embedded. The radiation pressure is insuffcient to drive the acceleration of this rapidly evolving outflow. The observed evolution of the outflow kinematics instead closely resembles that of solar coronal mass ejections, implying magnetic driving and, conceivably, reconnection near the accretion disk as the likely mechanisms behind both the UFO launch and the associated soft flare."

Existing approaches typically fine-tune natural foundation models (e.g., SAM) with limited supervision, functioning merely as domain adapters rather than surgical foundation models. Consequently, they struggle to generalize across the vast variability of surgical targets. To bridge this gap, we present LapFM, a foundation model designed to evolve robust segmentation capabilities from massive unlabeled surgical images. Distinct from medical foundation models relying on inefficient self-supervised proxy tasks, LapFM leverages a Hierarchical Concept Evolving Pre-training paradigm. First, we establish a Laparoscopic Concept Hierarchy (LCH) via a hierarchical mask decoder with parent-child query embeddings, unifying diverse entities (i.e., Anatomy, Tissue, and Instrument) into a scalable knowledge structure with cross-granularity semantic consistency. Second, we propose a Confidence-driven Evolving Labeling that iteratively generates and filters pseudo-labels based on hierarchical consistency, progressively incorporating reliable samples from unlabeled images into training. This process yields LapBench-114K, a large-scale benchmark comprising 114K image-mask pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LapFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing new standards for granularity-adaptive generalization in universal laparoscopic segmentation.

Two distinct rock samples, representative of two different rock formations - Bentheimer sandstone and Estaillades carbonate - are investigated. The Bentheimer sandstone image, with dimensions 1,950x1,950x10,800 voxels at 6 micron resolution, comprising 41 billion voxels, represents a largely homogeneous structure, while the Estaillades carbonate image, at 1,144x1,144x6,000 voxels and 3.9676 micron resolution, amounting to 8 billion voxels, features greater heterogeneity, including micro-porous regions. These images are used for direct CFD simulations with GeoChemFoam, our OpenFOAM-based numerical solver, leveraging the computational resources of the UK supercomputer ARCHER2. One of the key aspects of the study is the use of the Darcy-Brinkman-Stokes approach, for which the solid surface is represented using a volumetric indicator function, rather than a complex mesh. This enables the use of simple Cartesian meshes that can be generated in parallel in an efficient and scalable manner. The study explores both weak and strong scaling through subvolume decomposition, demonstrating that, due to the strong scalability and the computational power of ARCHER2, full-resolution CFD simulations can be carried out without the need for image size reduction. This work illustrates the potential of HPC to perform detailed, full-scale simulations on large, high-resolution micro-CT data. The approach relies on a meshing strategy that leverages simple, parallelisable Cartesian grids derived from volumetric indicator functions, eliminating the need for complex surface-conforming meshes and allowing scalable simulation of flow and transport in geological and engineering applications."

    "abstract": "Accurately recovering 6D poses in densely packed industrial bin-picking environments remain a serious challenge, owing to occlusions, reflections, and textureless parts. We introduce a holistic depth-only 6D pose estimation approach that fuses multi-view depth maps into either a fine-grained 3D point cloud in its vanilla version, or a sparse Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF). At the core of our framework lies a staged heatmap mechanism that yields scene-adaptive attention priors across different resolutions, steering computation toward foreground regions, thus keeping memory requirements at high resolutions feasible. Along, we propose a density-aware sparse transformer block that dynamically attends to (self-) occlusions and the non-uniform distribution of 3D data. While sparse 3D approaches has proven effective for long-range perception, its potential in close-range robotic applications remains underexplored. Our framework operates fully sparse, enabling high-resolution volumetric representations to capture fine geometric details crucial for accurate pose estimation in clutter. Our method processes the entire scene integrally, predicting the 6D pose via a novel per-voxel voting strategy, allowing simultaneous pose predictions for an arbitrary number of target objects. We validate our method on the recently published IPD and MV-YCB multi-view datasets, demonstrating competitive performance in heavily cluttered industrial and household bin picking scenarios."

We consider the decay of transverse spin-helices in antiferromagnetic spin-$S$ XXZ chains with single-ion anisostropy. The spin-helix decay is observable in the time evolution of the local magnetization that we calculate numerically for the system in the thermodynamic limit using infinite time-evolving block decimation simulations. Although the single-ion anisotropy prevents helix states from being eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, they still can be long-lived for appropriately chosen wave numbers. In case of an easy-axis exchange anisotropy the single-ion anisotropy may even stabilize the helices. Within a spin-wave approximation, we obtain a condition giving an estimate for the most stable wave number $Q$ that agrees qualitatively with our numerical results."

    "abstract": "Shading faults remain one of the most critical challenges affecting photovoltaic (PV) system efficiency, as they not only reduce power generation but also disturb maximum power point tracking (MPPT). To address this issue, this study introduces a hybrid optimization framework that combines Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) with a Shading-Aware Particle Swarm Optimization (SA-PSO) method. The proposed scheme is designed to adapt dynamically to both partial shading (20%-80%) and complete shading events, ensuring reliable global maximum power point (GMPP) detection. In this approach, the fuzzy controller provides rapid decision support based on shading patterns, while SA-PSO accelerates the search process and prevents the system from becoming trapped in local minima. A comparative performance assessment with the conventional Perturb and Observe (P\\&O) algorithm highlights the advantages of the hybrid model, showing up to an 11.8% improvement in power output and a 62% reduction in tracking time. These results indicate that integrating intelligent control with shading-aware optimization can significantly enhance the resilience and energy yield of PV systems operating under complex real-world conditions."

In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient paradigm to remedy this shortcoming, termed One-shot video-Clip based Retrieval AuGmentation (OneClip-RAG). Compared with existing video RAG methods, OneClip-RAG makes full use of the merits of video clips for augmented video understanding in terms of both knowledge integrity and semantic coherence. Besides, it is also equipped with a novel query-guided video chunking algorithm that can unify clip chunking and cross-modal retrieval in one processing step, avoiding redundant computations. To improve instruction following, we further propose a new dataset called SynLongVideo and design a progressive training regime for OneClip-RAG. OneClip-RAG is plugged into five recent MLLMs and validated on a set of long-video benchmarks. Experimental results not only show the obvious performance gains by OneClip-RAG over MLLMs, e.g., boosting InternLV2 8B and Qwen2-VL 7B to the level of GPT-4o on MLVU, but also show its superior efficiency in handling long videos. e.g., enabling LLaVA-Video understand up to an hour of videos in less than 2.2 minutes on a single 4090 GPU."

We address these issues without extra training by leveraging the inherent human continuity in videos. We propose SAM-Body4D, a training-free framework for temporally consistent and occlusion-robust HMR from videos. We first generate identity-consistent masklets using a promptable video segmentation model, then refine them with an Occlusion-Aware module to recover missing regions. The refined masklets guide SAM 3D Body to produce consistent full-body mesh trajectories, while a padding-based parallel strategy enables efficient multi-human inference.

Industrial standards, in particular, contain extensive technical information and complex rules presented in highly structured formats that combine tables, scopes of application, constraints, exceptions, and numerical calculations, making KG construction especially challenging. In this study, we propose a method that organizes such documents into a hierarchical semantic structure, decomposes sentences and tables into atomic propositions derived from conditional and numerical rules, and integrates them into an ontology-knowledge graph through LLM-based triple extraction. Our approach captures both the hierarchical and logical structures of documents, effectively representing domain-specific semantics that conventional methods fail to reflect. To verify its effectiveness, we constructed rule, table, and multi-hop QA datasets, as well as a toxic clause detection dataset, from industrial standards, and implemented an ontology-aware KG-RAG framework for comparative evaluation. Experimental results show that our method achieves significant performance improvements across all QA types compared to existing KG-RAG approaches. This study demonstrates that reliable and scalable knowledge representation is feasible even for industrial documents with intertwined conditions, constraints, and scopes, contributing to future domain-specific RAG development and intelligent document management."

We collected and analyzed 3,546 cases of vulnerabilities in upgradable contracts,covering common vulnerability categories such as reentrancy, access control flaws, and integer overflow. Experimental results show that USCSA achieves an accuracy of 92.3%, recall of 89.7%, and F1-score of 91.0% in detecting upgrade-induced vulnerabilities. In addition, the efficiency of mapping high-risk changes has achieved a 30% improvement over the conventional approach. As a result, USCSA provides a significant advantage to improve the security and integrity of upgradable smart contracts, providing a novel and efficient solution to secure audits on blockchain applications."

While existing optimization efforts focus primarily on hardware energy efficiency, a significant but overlooked source of inefficiency is software energy waste caused by poor software design. This often includes redundant or poorly designed operations that consume more energy without improving performance. These inefficiencies arise in widely used ML frameworks and applications, yet developers often lack the visibility and tools to detect and diagnose them. We propose differential energy debugging, a novel approach that leverages the observation that competing ML systems often implement similar functionality with vastly different energy consumption. Building on this insight, we design and implement Magneton, an energy profiler that compares energy consumption between similar ML systems at the operator level and automatically pinpoints code regions and configuration choices responsible for excessive energy use. Applied to 9 popular ML systems spanning LLM inference, general ML frameworks, and image generation, Magneton detects and diagnoses 16 known cases of software energy inefficiency and further discovers 8 previously unknown cases, 7 of which have been confirmed by developers."

The introduction of a carbon barrier layer at the Ru-on-B4C interface resulted in significant suppression of ruthenium boride formation. The thermal stability of the B4C/Ru system was also studied upon annealing at 400$^{\\circ}$C for 1 hour before and after the introduction of the carbon barrier layer. It was shown that the introduction of a carbon barrier layer at the Ru-on-B4C interface increases the thermal stability of the system, which makes this system more suitable for use in optical systems exposed to long-term radiation.

    "abstract": "Despite advancements in machine learning for security, rule-based detection remains prevalent in Security Operations Centers due to the resource intensiveness and skill gap associated with ML solutions. While traditional rule-based methods offer efficiency, their rigidity leads to high false positives or negatives and requires continuous manual maintenance. This paper proposes a novel, two-stage hybrid framework to democratize ML-based threat detection. The first stage employs intentionally loose YARA rules for coarse-grained filtering, optimized for high recall. The second stage utilizes an ML classifier to filter out false positives from the first stage's output. To overcome data scarcity, the system leverages Simula, a seedless synthetic data generation framework, enabling security analysts to create high-quality training datasets without extensive data science expertise or pre-labeled examples. A continuous feedback loop incorporates real-time investigation results to adaptively tune the ML model, preventing rule degradation. This proposed model with active learning has been rigorously tested for a prolonged time in a production environment spanning tens of thousands of systems. The system handles initial raw log volumes often reaching 250 billion events per day, significantly reducing them through filtering and ML inference to a handful of daily tickets for human investigation. Live experiments over an extended timeline demonstrate a general improvement in the model's precision over time due to the active learning feature. This approach offers a self-sustained, low-overhead, and low-maintenance solution, allowing security professionals to guide model learning as expert ``teachers''."

    "abstract": "Surface operators in four-dimensional gauge theories are two-dimensional defects, serving as natural generalizations of Wilson lines and 't Hooft line operators. They act as ideal probes for exploring the non-perturbative structure of the theory. Rigid surface operators are a specific class of surface operators characterized by the absence of continuous deformation parameters. It is expected that a closed $S$-duality map should exist among these rigid operators. While progress has been made on specific examples or subclasses by leveraging invariants and empirical conjectures, a complete picture remains elusive. A significant challenge arises when multiple rigid surface operators share identical invariants, making the determination of $S$-duality relations difficult. More critically, a mismatch exists in the number of rigid surface operators between dual theories when classified by invariants; this is referred to as the \\textit{mismatch problem}. This discrepancy suggests the necessity of extending the scope of consideration beyond strictly rigid operators. In this paper, we propose a direct, natural, and precise $S$-duality map for rigid surface operators. Our map is realized by moving the longest row in the pair of partitions defining a surface operator from one factor to the other, with an additional box appended or deleted to balance the total number of boxes. This mapping naturally incorporates non-rigid surface operators, thereby resolving the mismatch problem. The proposed map is applicable to gauge groups of all ranks and clarifies several long-standing puzzles in the field."

Preserving high-frequency details (e.g., text edges and lines) is critical in this process because shadows often obscure or distort fine structures. This paper proposes a matte vision transformer (MatteViT), a novel shadow removal framework that applies spatial and frequency-domain information to eliminate shadows while preserving fine-grained structural details. To effectively retain these details, we employ two preservation strategies. First, our method introduces a lightweight high-frequency amplification module (HFAM) that decomposes and adaptively amplifies high-frequency components. Second, we present a continuous luminance-based shadow matte, generated using a custom-built matte dataset and shadow matte generator, which provides precise spatial guidance from the earliest processing stage. These strategies enable the model to accurately identify fine-grained regions and restore them with high fidelity. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks (RDD and Kligler) demonstrate that MatteViT achieves state-of-the-art performance, providing a robust and practical solution for real-world document shadow removal. Furthermore, the proposed method better preserves text-level details in downstream tasks, such as optical character recognition, improving recognition performance over prior methods."

    "abstract": "We introduce and study \\emph{brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces} in Newtonian and relativistic spacetimes. Starting from the classical cycloidal brachistochrone in a constant gravitational field, we construct a Newtonian ``brachistochrone-ruled worldsheet'' whose rulings are time-minimizing trajectories between pairs of endpoints. We then generalize this construction to stationary Lorentzian spacetimes by exploiting the reduction of arrival-time functionals to Finsler- or Jacobi-type length functionals on a spatial manifold. In this framework, relativistic brachistochrones arise as geodesics of an associated Finsler structure, and brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces are timelike surfaces ruled by these time-minimizing worldlines. We work out explicit examples in Minkowski spacetime and in the Schwarzschild exterior: in the flat case, for a bounded-speed time functional, the brachistochrones are straight timelike lines and a simple family of brachistochrone-ruled surfaces turns out to be totally geodesic; in the Schwarzschild case, we show how coordinate-time minimization at fixed energy reduces to geodesics of a Jacobi metric on the spatial slice, and outline a numerical scheme for constructing brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces. Finally, we discuss basic geometric properties of such surfaces and identify natural Jacobi fields along the rulings."

    "abstract": "Zermelo's navigation problem seeks the trajectory of minimal travel time between two points in a fluid flow. We address this problem for an agent -- such as a micro-robot or active particle -- that is advected by a two-dimensional flow, self-propels at a fixed speed smaller than or comparable to the characteristic flow velocity, and can steer its direction. The flows considered span increasing levels of complexity, from steady solid-body rotation to the Taylor-Green flow and fully developed turbulence in the inverse cascade regime. Although optimal control theory provides time-minimizing trajectories, these solutions become unstable in chaotic regimes realized for complex background flows. To design robust navigation strategies under such conditions, we apply reinforcement learning. Both action-value (Q-learning) and policy-gradient (one-step actor-critic) methods achieve successful navigation with comparable performance. Crucially, we show that agents trained on coarse-grained flows -- retaining only large-scale features -- generalize effectively to the full turbulent field. This robustness to incomplete flow information is essential for practical navigation in real-world oceanic and atmospheric environments."

The UAV identify and provide overhead views of casualties, while UGVs equipped with specialized sensors measure vital signs and detect and localize physical injuries. Unlike previous work that focused on exploration or limited medical evaluation, this system addresses the complete triage process: victim localization, vital sign measurement, injury severity classification, mental status assessment, and data consolidation for first responders.

    "abstract": "Radio Frequency (RF) sensing is attracting interest in research, standardization, and industry, especially for its potential in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. By leveraging the properties of the ElectroMagnetic (EM) waves used in wireless networks, RF sensing captures environmental information such as the presence and movement of people and objects, enabling passive localization and vision applications. This paper investigates the theoretical bounds on accuracy and resolution for RF sensing systems within dense networks. It employs an EM model to predict the effects of body blockage in various scenarios. To detect human movements, the paper proposes a deep graph neural network, trained on Received Signal Strength (RSS) samples generated from the EM model. These samples are structured as dense graphs, with nodes representing antennas and edges as radio links. Focusing on the problem of identifying the number of human subjects co-present in a monitored area over time, the paper analyzes the theoretical limits on the number of distinguishable subjects, exploring how these limits depend on factors such as the number of radio links, the size of the monitored area and the subjects physical dimensions. These bounds enable the prediction of the system performance during network pre-deployment stages. The paper also presents the results of an indoor case study, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and confirm the model's predictive potential in the network design stages."

Upon an abrupt alteration of the Hamiltonian in a one-dimensional non-Hermitian sys tem,the ensuring temporal interface excites both reflected and refracted wave modes. By intro ducing a chiral-symmetric Hamiltonian, this study reveals the topological effects at such temporal interfaces. We find that the reflection and refraction coefficients exhibit a topological braiding struc ture. This structure is directly determined by the difference in the topological invariants across the interface, establishing a bulk-boundary correspondence for temporal interfaces in non-Hermitian systems. Furthermore, we propose a dynamical probe that leverages the geometric similarity of eigenstates at the temporal interface to detect topological phase transitions. These findings estab lish a fundamental connection between topological braiding and nonreciprocal dynamics at temporal interfaces, providing a platform to explore phase transition detection and nonreciprocal phenomena in time-varying non-Hermitian systems."

Moreover, most prior designs do not target endtoend serving, leaving the codesign of dataflow, parallel mapping, and scheduling underexplored.

    "abstract": "Rapidly advancing artificial intelligence (AI) systems introduce novel, uncertain, and potentially catastrophic risks. Managing these risks requires a mature risk-management infrastructure whose cornerstone is rigorous risk modeling. We conceptualize AI risk modeling as the tight integration of (i) scenario building$-$causal mapping from hazards to harms$-$and (ii) risk estimation$-$quantifying the likelihood and severity of each pathway. We review classical techniques such as Fault and Event Tree Analyses, FMEA/FMECA, STPA and Bayesian networks, and show how they can be adapted to advanced AI. A survey of emerging academic and industry efforts reveals fragmentation: capability benchmarks, safety cases, and partial quantitative studies are valuable but insufficient when divorced from comprehensive causal scenarios. Comparing the nuclear, aviation, cybersecurity, financial, and submarine domains, we observe that every sector combines deterministic guarantees for unacceptable events with probabilistic assessments of the broader risk landscape. We argue that advanced-AI governance should adopt a similar dual approach and that verifiable, provably-safe AI architectures are urgently needed to supply deterministic evidence where current models are the result of opaque end-to-end optimization procedures rather than specified by hand. In one potential governance-ready framework, developers conduct iterative risk modeling and regulators compare the results with predefined societal risk tolerance thresholds. The paper provides both a methodological blueprint and opens a discussion on the best way to embed sound risk modeling at the heart of advanced-AI risk management."

Here, we employ the experimentally realized AgBiI$_4$ double salt as a structural prototype and replace Bi$^{3+}$ with In$^{3+}$ to design a novel lead-free halide compound, AgInI$_4$. First-principles calculations predict that AgInI$_4$ is both chemically and dynamically stable, exhibiting a direct band gap of 1.72 eV, comparable to its bismuth analogue. However, its predicted photovoltaic performance, evaluated using the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency metric, is lower under both solar and LED illumination. This reduction arises primarily from symmetry-forbidden optical transitions and the absence of Bi-derived 6s$^2$ lone-pair states at the valence band maximum. High-throughput screening of the Ag-In-I ternary phase-space reveals several more stable and metastable compounds that fall into two structural families: tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated, with characteristic band gaps near 3.0 eV and 2.0 eV, respectively. Despite multiple synthetic attempts, the predicted AgInI$_4$ phase could not be experimentally realized, underscoring the challenges of stabilizing indium-based halide double salts. While these materials are unlikely to serve as efficient photovoltaic absorbers, their tunable band gaps and stability make them promising candidates for charge transport and other optoelectronic applications."

    "abstract": "Dislocations and polishing-induced defect networks in synthetic diamond generate local strain fields that broaden Raman features and limit optical, thermal, and electronic performance. Sub-melt laser annealing has emerged as a route to repair near-surface defects without graphitization, yet quantitative evidence of densification, defect depletion, and property recovery remains limited. Here, we show that nanosecond pulsed-laser annealing (PLA) can relax dislocation-associated strain in single-crystal CVD diamond by compacting and reorganizing the damaged near-surface region. Single- and two-pulse PLA were applied, and structural evolution was quantified using co-registered ISO 25178 white-light interferometry, depth-resolved Raman spectroscopy, and cross-sectional STEM with geometric phase analysis (GPA). Across a 5x6 grid(n = 30), responsive regions show large reductions in local slope (Sdq 45-65%), developed area (Sdr 60-90%), height spread (Sp, Sz 30-65%), void volume (Vv 57-60%), and roughness amplitude (Sa, Sq 48-57%), consistent with densification of ~4-6.5 nm. Raman profiling reveals narrowing of the diamond line and improved spectral uniformity to depths of ~2-3 μm, indicating relaxation of dislocation-mediated strain beyond the compaction layer. STEM-GPA strain maps confirm smoother strain fields, reduced hotspots, and redistribution of localized strain concentrations after PLA. These results show that sub-melt PLA reduces dislocation-driven strain by compacting surface-connected free volume and reorganizing defect networks. The approach provides a scalable path to upgrade industrial-grade diamond including homoepitaxial, heteroepitaxial, and polycrystalline CVD to low-defect, device-ready surfaces relevant to high-power electronics, photonics, and quantum substrates."

A critical issue may arise in interaction between $XHe$ and atomic nuclei due to the unshielded nuclear attraction, which could destabilize the dark atom's bound state. To resolve this, we propose a novel numerical quantum mechanical approach that accounts for self-consistent electromagnetic-nuclear couplings. This method addresses to eliminate the inherent complexity of the $XHe$-nucleus three-body system, where analytical solutions are intractable. By reconstructing the effective interaction potential - including dipole Coulomb barrier and shallow potential well - we demonstrate how these features lead to the formation of $XHe$-nucleus bound states and modulate low-energy capture processes. Our model enables validation of the dark atom hypothesis, particularly in interpreting experimental anomalies like annual modulation signals observed in DAMA/LIBRA. These findings advance the theoretical foundation for dark matter interactions and provide a robust framework for future experimental design."

A key strength of SVD lies in its ability to separate information into orthogonal subspaces. While SVD is a well-established tool in ECG analysis, particularly for source separation, this work proposes a refined method for selecting a threshold to distinguish between maternal and fetal components more effectively. In the first part of the paper, the focus is onmedical signal analysis,where the concepts of Energy Gap Variation (EGV) and Singular Energy are introduced to isolate fetal and maternal ECG signals, improving the known ones. Furthermore, the approach is significantly enhanced by the application of GSVD, which provides additional discriminative power for more accurate signal separation. The second part introduces a novel technique called Singular Smoothness, developed for image analysis. This method incorporates Singular Entropy and the Frobenius normto evaluate information density, and is applied to the detection of natural anomalies such asmountain fractures and burned forest regions. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches."

We also propose a novel evaluation methodology for assessing feedback generation, combining automatic consistency metrics with expert-based validation of extracted learner errors. Results demonstrate that the fine-tuned Latxa model produces criterion-aligned, pedagogically meaningful feedback and identifies a wider range of error types than proprietary models.

Part qualification aims at verifying that an additively manufactured part meets performance requirements; therefore, predicting the complex stress-strain behaviors of additively manufactured parts is critical. We develop a dynamic time warping (DTW)-transfer learning (TL) framework for additive manufacturing part qualification by transferring knowledge of the stress-strain behaviors of additively manufactured low-cost polymers to metals. Specifically, the framework employs DTW to select a polymer dataset as the source domain that is the most relevant to the target metal dataset. Using a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, four source polymers (i.e., Nylon, PLA, CF-ABS, and Resin) and three target metals (i.e., AlSi10Mg, Ti6Al4V, and carbon steel) that are fabricated by different AM techniques are utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the DTW-TL framework. Experimental results show that the DTW-TL framework identifies the closest match between polymers and metals to select one single polymer dataset as the source domain. The DTW-TL model achieves the lowest mean absolute percentage error of 12.41% and highest coefficient of determination of 0.96 when three metals are used as the target domain, respectively, outperforming the vanilla LSTM model without TL as well as the TL model pre-trained on four polymer datasets as the source domain."

A key design principle of NGN is decoupling of service-related functions from the underlying transport stratum, making user services independent of transport technologies. Interestingly, the NGN architecture, as defined in ITU standards, did not follow this design principle for internal network services, e.g., mobility, or authentication though adhering for external user services like IPTV or Multimedia services. These internal services are handled by the NGN transport control plane, making them an intrinsic part of the transport stratum, resulting in a tightly coupled service and transport functionality as opposed to the proclaimed design goal. This design choice may force each transport technology to support internal services individually, e.g., separate authentication service for each transport, leading to duplication. Since the NGN architecture is the base underlying architecture for most packet-based telecommunications network including advanced cellular networks like 4th/5th Generation cellular networks, the limitation persists in these cellular networks as well. To remedy the situation, the decoupling of service and transport can be generalized to include internal services like mobility and authentication also. In this context, the recently published ITU Y.2325 recommendation, defines an evolved NGN architecture, wherein all services, including internal network services, are decoupled from the transport stratum. The proposal results in a more scalable and modular evolved NGN architecture that can be used as a template for all future telecom networks including IMT-2030 (6th generation mobile networks).

The model extends a previously calibrated dry contact formulation by incorporating liquid bridges that generate capillary adhesion between particles, while liquid migration is represented through evolving bridge volumes. Two reactor-grade polypropylene powders with different particle size distributions, bulk densities, and surface morphologies are investigated, resulting in distinct wetting behavior. A schematic framework is introduced to relate increasing liquid content to the transition from dry to wet contacts using two key parameters: the minimum liquid film volume and the maximum liquid bridge volume. These parameters are calibrated using dynamic angle of repose measurements from rotating drum experiments. The calibrated model reproduces the experimental flow behavior of both powders: full agreement is obtained for the coarser, more porous powder across all liquid contents, while for the finer, denser powder, agreement is achieved at low to moderate liquid contents. At higher liquid contents, discrepancies arise due to agglomeration effects amplified by particle scaling. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the dynamic angle of repose as a calibration target and highlight the limitations of particle scaling for strongly cohesive wet granular systems. The proposed framework provides a practical basis for DEM-based modeling of wet powder flow in industrial processes."

This class encompasses not only standard uniformly controlled gates (UCGs) but also a wide range of circuits with uniformly controlled structures. However, their circuit-depth and gate-count complexities have not been systematically analyzed within a unified framework. In this work, we study the general decomposition problem for UCG and UCG-like structure. We then introduce the restricted Uniformly Controlled Gates (rUCGs) as a unified algebraic model, defined by a 2-divisible Abelian group that models the controlled gate set. This model captures uniformly controlled rotations, multi-qubit uniformly controlled gates, and diagonal unitaries. Furthermore, this model also naturally incorporates k-sparse version (k-rUCGs), where only a subset of control qubits participate in each multi-qubit gate. Building on this algebraic model, we develop a general framework. For an n-control rUCG, the framework reduce the gate complexity from ${O(n2^n)}$ to ${O(2^n})$ and the circuit depth from ${O(2^n\\log n)}$ to ${O(2^n\\log n/n)}$. The framework further provides systematic size and depth bounds for k-rUCGs by exploiting sparsity in the control space, with same optimization coefficient as rUCG, respectively. Empirical evaluations on representative QAOA circuits and quantum state preparation both confirm reductions in depth and size. Crucially, these results highlight that the rUCG model and its associated decomposition framework unify circuits previously considered structurally distinct under a single, asymptotically optimal synthesis paradigm."

In the non-relativistic limit, the generalized Lane-Emden equations describe a smooth core-crust transition layer. We integrate the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations across different $(τ_1,σ_1)$ regimes, where these parameters encode thermal and interaction effects in the core. The resulting mass-radius sequences yield low neutron star masses $(0.99-2.05)M_{\\odot}$, and the chemical potential exhibits the characteristic signatures of phase-transition behavior at densities well above the matching point. Our results show that analytic EOS models can reproduce the key phenomenology of phase transitions and provide a controlled framework for exploring low-mass neutron star configurations."

For the advection-reaction regime without reverse mutations, we derive analytical solutions using the method of characteristics and obtain explicit expressions for time-varying carrying capacities and mutation velocities. We analyze how decaying and accelerating mutation rates shape the saturation and propagation of population fronts through level-set geometry. When reverse mutations are included, the system becomes a quasilinear parabolic equation with diffusion in genotype space; numerical experiments show that backward mutation flows stabilize the dynamics and smooth the evolving fronts. The proposed model generalizes classical quasispecies and Crow-Kimura formulations by incorporating logistic regulation, variable mutation rates, and reversible transitions, offering a unified approach to evolutionary processes relevant to virology, bacterial adaptation, and tumor progression."

Existing approaches based on large language models typically rely on single-task models that lack adaptability, interpretability, and reliability, especially when applied across various communication frameworks and clinical domains. In this study, we developed a Multi-framework Structured Agentic AI system for Clinical Communication (MOSAIC), built on a LangGraph-based architecture that orchestrates four core agents, including a Plan Agent for codebook selection and workflow planning, an Update Agent for maintaining up-to-date retrieval databases, a set of Annotation Agents that applies codebook-guided retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with dynamic few-shot prompting, and a Verification Agent that provides consistency checks and feedback. To evaluate performance, we compared MOSAIC outputs against gold-standard annotations created by trained human coders. We developed and evaluated MOSAIC using 26 gold standard annotated transcripts for training and 50 transcripts for testing, spanning rheumatology and OB/GYN domains. On the test set, MOSAIC achieved an overall F1 score of 0.928. Performance was highest in the Rheumatology subset (F1 = 0.962) and strongest for Patient Behavior (e.g., patients asking questions, expressing preferences, or showing assertiveness). Ablations revealed that MOSAIC outperforms baseline benchmarking."

    "abstract": "Driver distraction behavior recognition using in-vehicle cameras demands real-time inference on edge devices. However, lightweight models often fail to capture fine-grained behavioral cues, resulting in reduced performance on unseen drivers or under varying conditions. ROI-based methods also increase computational cost, making it difficult to balance efficiency and accuracy. This work addresses the need for a lightweight architecture that overcomes these constraints. We propose Computationally efficient Dynamic region of Interest Routing and domain-invariant Adversarial learning for lightweight driver behavior recognition (C-DIRA). The framework combines saliency-driven Top-K ROI pooling and fused classification for local feature extraction and integration. Dynamic ROI routing enables selective computation by applying ROI inference only to high difficulty data samples. Moreover, pseudo-domain labeling and adversarial learning are used to learn domain-invariant features robust to driver and background variation. Experiments on the State Farm Distracted Driver Detection Dataset show that C-DIRA maintains high accuracy with significantly fewer FLOPs and lower latency than prior lightweight models. It also demonstrates robustness under visual degradation such as blur and low-light, and stable performance across unseen domains. These results confirm C-DIRA's effectiveness in achieving compactness, efficiency, and generalization."

Due to the faint and irregular morphology of these galaxies, the default photometry is often inaccurate. Therefore, we utilized The Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) data to perform careful photometric measurements, and find that the low HI mass galaxies have similar stellar mass densities to dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies. Compared to other dwarf galaxy populations, the HI-selected dwarfs exhibit higher stellar mass densities than ultradiffuse galaxies, and similar densities to HI-selected low-surface-brightness galaxies, albeit with lower stellar masses, suggesting a possible evolutionary connection among these populations. By classifying the galaxies according to their HI spectral-line profiles, we show that the double-peaked sources conform closely to the Tully-Fisher relation, whereas the single-peaked sources follow the Faber-Jackson relation but with large scatter. This indicates that the single-peaked systems are likely dispersion dominated and that the relationship between stellar mass and halo mass in such systems may remain consistent across both low- and high-mass regimes. These findings suggest that HI-selected dwarf galaxies with single-peaked HI profiles may share a similar dynamical state with massive ellipticals, offering new insights into their structural evolution and the diversity of formation pathways for low-mass galaxies."

    "abstract": "In this article, we introduce a Topological Data Analysis (TDA) pipeline for neural spike train data. Understanding how the brain transforms sensory information into perception and behavior requires analyzing coordinated neural population activity. Modern electrophysiology enables simultaneous recording of spike train ensembles, but extracting meaningful information from these datasets remains a central challenge in neuroscience. A fundamental question is how ensembles of neurons discriminate between different stimuli or behavioral states, particularly when individual neurons exhibit weak or no stimulus selectivity, yet their coordinated activity may still contribute to network-level encoding. We describe a TDA framework that identifies stimulus-discriminative structure in spike train ensembles recorded from the mouse insular cortex during presentation of deionized water stimuli at distinct non-nociceptive temperatures. We show that population-level topological signatures effectively differentiate oral thermal stimuli even when individual neurons provide little or no discrimination. These findings demonstrate that ensemble organization can carry perceptually relevant information that standard single-unit analysis may miss. The framework builds on a mathematical representation of spike train ensembles that enables persistent homology to be applied to collections of point processes. At its core is the widely-used Victor-Purpura (VP) distance. Using this metric, we construct persistence-based descriptors that capture multiscale topological features of ensemble geometry. Two key theoretical results support the method: a stability theorem establishing robustness of persistent homology to perturbations in the VP metric parameter, and a probabilistic stability theorem ensuring robustness of topological signatures."

For example, in analogy with the classical case, we prove that these higher square principles abound in the constructible universe but can be forced to fail, modulo large cardinals. Finally, we prove that certain higher rho-functions obtained by walking along higher square sequences exhibit non-triviality in addition to coherence. In particular, it follows that higher square principles on a cardinal $λ$ entail certain non-vanishing Čech cohomology groups for $λ$ considered with the order topology."

Health, education, work, inequality, and gender dominate the study of SDGs in psychology, shifting from an early focus on work to education and inequality, and since the 1960s, health. United States-based research leads across most goals. Other countries set distinct priorities (e.g., China: education and work; Australia: health). Women comprise about one-third of authors, concentrated in social and health goals, but have been underrepresented in STEM-oriented goals. The 2015 launch of the SDGs marked a turning point: SDG-tagged publications have been receiving more citations than comparable non-SDG work, reversing a pre-2015 deficit.

From an optical standpoint, perspective-based blur is depth-position-dependent: objects residing at distinct spatial locations incur different blur levels even under the same imaging settings. Inspired by this, we propose a novel method that estimate metric depth by examining the blur pattern of a video stream and dense trajectory via joint optical design algorithm. Specifically, we employ off-the-shelf vision encoder and point tracker to extract video information. Then, we estimate depth map via windowed embedding and multi-window aggregation, and densify the sparse trajectory from the optical algorithm using a vision-language model. Evaluations on multiple depth datasets demonstrate that our method attains strong performance over large depth range, while maintaining favorable generalization. Relative to the real trajectory in handheld shooting settings, our optical algorithm achieves superior precision and the dense reconstruction maintains strong accuracy."

A massive dark vector particle-antiparticle pair acquires small millicharges via a dimension-five kinetic mixing operator that induces a dimension-four mixing term with effective coefficient $ε$, and interacts through the hidden gauge coupling $g_D$, linking it weakly to the Standard Model. Solving the relic abundance with a two-temperature Boltzmann evolution including plasmon decays, we find that $ε, g_D \\sim 10^{-7}$ reproduce the observed density while satisfying astrophysical and cosmological bounds. This minimal framework links non-Abelian vector dynamics, long-range dark forces, and dark matter, and can be testable with upcoming sub-GeV dark matter direct-detection experiments."

This paper proposes a new Hybrid Splatting(HybridSplat) mechanism for Gaussian primitives. Our key idea is a new reflection-baked Gaussian tracing, which bakes the view-dependent reflection within each Gaussian primitive while rendering the reflection using tile-based Gaussian splatting. Then we integrate the reflective Gaussian primitives with base Gaussian primitives using a unified hybrid splatting framework for high-fidelity scene reconstruction. Moreover, we further introduce a pipeline-level acceleration for the hybrid splatting, and reflection-sensitive Gaussian pruning to reduce the model size, thus achieving much faster rendering speed and lower memory storage while preserving the reflection rendering quality. By extensive evaluation, our HybridSplat accelerates about 7x rendering speed across complex reflective scenes from Ref-NeRF, NeRF-Casting with 4x fewer Gaussian primitives than similar ray-tracing based Gaussian splatting baselines, serving as a new state-of-the-art method especially for complex reflective scenes."

    "abstract": "Quantum communication between remote chips is essential for realizing large-scale superconducting quantum computers. For such communication, itinerant microwave photons propagating through transmission lines offer a promising approach. However, demonstrations to date have relied on frequency-tunable circuit elements to compensate for fabrication-related parameter variations between sender and receiver devices, introducing control complexity and limiting scalability. In this work, we demonstrate deterministic quantum state transfer and remote entanglement generation between fixed-frequency superconducting qubits on separate chips. To compensate for the sender-receiver mismatch, we employ a frequency-tunable photon-generation technique which enables us to adjust the photon frequency without modifying circuit parameters. To enhance the frequency tunability, we implement broadband transfer resonators composed of two coupled coplanar-waveguide resonators, achieving a bandwidth of more than 100 MHz. This broadband design enables successful quantum communication across a 30-MHz range of photon frequencies between the remote qubits. Quantum process tomography reveals state transfer fidelities of around 78% and Bell-state fidelities of around 73% across the full frequency range. Our approach avoids the complexity of the control lines and noise channels, providing a flexible pathway toward scalable quantum networks."

Then, Yang-Baxter deformations of the Wess-Zumino-Witten model based on the OSP$(1|2)$ Lie supergroup are specified by super skew-symmetric classical r-matrices. In this regard, the effect coming from the deformation is reflected as the coefficient of both metric and $B$-field. Furthermore, it is shown that all resulting classical r-matrices are non-Abelian and also non-unimodular, which leads us to graded generalized supergravity equations. We show that the background of undeformed model is a solution of the graded generalized supergravity equations when supplemented by an appropriate supervector field obtaining from the linear combination of the Killing supervectors corresponding to the background, while the deformed models do not satisfy these equations. This is consistent with our expectations, since the deformed models under consideration do not describe a Green-Schwarz superstring. However, the deformed backgrounds are interesting, in particular in the OSP$(1|2)$ case they are rare, much hard technical work was needed to obtain them."

Accounting for forces in biology is a problem that lies at the intersection of soft condensed matter physics, statistical mechanics, computer simulations and novel experimental methodologies, all adapted to a cellular context. This review surveys how forces arise within the cell. We provide a summary of the relevant background in basic biophysics, of soft-matter systems in and out of thermodynamic equilibrium, and of various force measurement methods in biology. We then show how these ideas can be incorporated into a description of cell-scale processes where forces are involved. Our examples include polymerization forces, motion of molecular motors, the properties of the actomyosin cortex, the mechanics of cell division, and shape changes in tissues. We show how new conceptual frameworks are required for understanding the consequences of cell-scale forces for biological function. We emphasize active matter descriptions, methodological tools that provide ways of incorporating non-equilibrium effects in a systematic manner into conceptual as well as quantitative descriptions. Understanding the functions of cells will necessarily require integrating the role of physical forces with the assimilation and processing of information. This integration is likely to have been a significant driver of evolutionary change."

Magnetic activity of the ultracool dwarfs is investigated by using the H$α$ line emission as a proxy. The rotational periods of 82 ultracool dwarfs are derived based on the Kepler/K2 light curves.

Here we ask whether quantum simulators have already uncovered new physical phenomena-and, if so, in which areas and with what impact. We find that, in several notable instances, they have advanced our understanding of many-body quantum dynamics. Although many of these insights could in principle have been obtained theoretically or numerically, they were nevertheless first achieved using quantum processors.

Configure private, extensible agents: onboard private code folders (up to approximately 500 files), connect Notion, customize AI agent personas via embedding and in-context training, and deploy via Docker, CLI, or VSCode extension. In practice, SolidGPT empowers developer productivity through: Semantic-rich code navigation: no more hunting through files or wondering where a feature lives.

Still, it remains challenging due to factors such as mechanical vibrations and cumulative sensor drift in dynamic environments. This paper presents RLCNet, a novel end-to-end trainable deep learning framework for the simultaneous online calibration of these multimodal sensors. Validated on real-world datasets, RLCNet is designed for practical deployment and demonstrates robust performance under diverse conditions. To support real-time operation, an online calibration framework is introduced that incorporates a weighted moving average and outlier rejection, enabling dynamic adjustment of calibration parameters with reduced prediction noise and improved resilience to drift. An ablation study highlights the significance of architectural choices, while comparisons with existing methods demonstrate the superior accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Predicting diseases solely from patient-side information, such as demographics and self-reported symptoms, has attracted significant research attention due to its potential to enhance patient awareness, facilitate early healthcare engagement, and improve healthcare system efficiency. However, existing approaches encounter critical challenges, including imbalanced disease distributions and a lack of interpretability, resulting in biased or unreliable predictions. To address these issues, we propose the Knowledge graph-enhanced, Prototype-aware, and Interpretable (KPI) framework. KPI systematically integrates structured and trusted medical knowledge into a unified disease knowledge graph, constructs clinically meaningful disease prototypes, and employs contrastive learning to enhance predictive accuracy, which is particularly important for long-tailed diseases. Additionally, KPI utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate patient-specific, medically relevant explanations, thereby improving interpretability and reliability. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that KPI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predictive accuracy and provides clinically valid explanations that closely align with patient narratives, highlighting its practical value for patient-centered healthcare delivery."

This optimization task is a challenging mixed-integer nonconvex problem, involving integer-valued voltage levels and trigono metric nonlinearities in both the objective and the constraints. We address this challenge by reinterpreting OPP design as a periodic mode-selecting optimal control problem of a hybrid system, where selecting angles and levels corresponds to choosing jump times in a transition graph. This time-domain formulation enables the direct use of convex-relaxation techniques from optimal control, producing a hierarchy of semidefinite programs that lower-bound the minimal achievable harmonic distortion and scale subquadratically with the number of converter levels and switching angles. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approachs"

    "abstract": "Accurately forecasting flight departure delays is essential for improving operational efficiency and mitigating the cascading disruptions that propagate through tightly coupled aircraft rotations. Traditional machine learning approaches often treat upstream delays as static variables, overlooking the dynamic recovery processes that determine whether a delay is absorbed or transmitted to subsequent legs. This study introduces a two-stage machine learning framework that explicitly models delay-absorption behavior and incorporates it into downstream delay prediction. In Stage I, a CatBoost classifier estimates the probability that a flight successfully absorbs an upstream delay based on operational, temporal, and meteorological features. This probability, termed AbsorbScore, quantifies airport- and flight-specific resilience to delay propagation. In Stage II, an XGBoost classifier integrates AbsorbScore with schedule, weather, and congestion indicators to predict whether a flight will depart more than 15 minutes late. Using U.S. domestic flight and NOAA weather data from Summer 2023, the proposed framework achieves substantial improvements over baseline models, increasing ROC-AUC from 0.865 to 0.898 and enhancing precision to 89.2% in identifying delayed flights. The results demonstrate that modeling delay absorption as an intermediate mechanism significantly improves predictive performance and yields interpretable insights into airport recovery dynamics, offering a practical foundation for data-driven delay management and proactive operational planning."

    "abstract": "Climate change debates have gained increasing visibility on social media, with YouTube emerging as one of the most influential platforms for political communication. Reaching billions of users worldwide, it functions both as a news outlet and as a space for public discourse. While existing studies of climate discourse on YouTube often adopt a global perspective, this study examines the platform through the lens of the Global North-South divide. We analyse a dataset of 758 climate-related videos and their comment sections, applying topic modelling and sentiment analysis to identify recurring discursive patterns. Through these patterns, we recognise parallels with respect to debates in international climate negotiations. The findings reveal notable differences. Videos from the Global North and Global South reflect real-world divides, with the North emphasising the need for policies to curb carbon emissions, while the South highlights developmental priorities. A key area of convergence between the regions lies in the shared recognition of the importance of emissions reduction and international agreements. Audience responses, however, diverge more sharply: comment sections under Global North videos are dominated by criticism, conspiracy, and climate fatigue, whereas those under Global South videos are generally more supportive, constructive, and knowledge-oriented. Overall, the study demonstrates how YouTube reflects and reshapes global climate politics, while also revealing the gap between curated narratives and public sentiment. Bridging these divides may contribute to more inclusive and cooperative approaches to climate action."

We have collected all the NEOWISE observations of 2001 CC21 from Nov 2021 through Feb 2024, a total of 132 frames, and analyzed this data to estimate an infrared radiometric diameter. We analyze the multi-epoch 3.4 and 4.6 micron NEOWISE data using an ellipsoidal rotating, cratered ThermoPhysical Model (TPM) to obtain estimates for the diameter, rotation pole, shape, and thermal inertia. 2001 CC21 is quite faint at 4.6 microns when Delta is about 0.7 AU, so the resulting diameter is substantially smaller than the 700 meters derived from the H magnitude and L spectral type. Recent polarimetric data has also suggested a smaller diameter, but not quite as small as the diameter derived from the thermal IR data. A fit to an ellipsoidal TPM model gives a volume equivalent sphere diameter of 337-27+33 meters [posterior median and central 68% confidence interval]. Prograde rotation with an obliquity of 24-9+6 deg is preferred. We also applied this TPM to the Spitzer data presented by Fornasier etal. (2024) and obtain a diameter of 476 +/- 9% meters which is consistent with the NEATM modeling presented by Fornasier etal. but with more realistic errorbars. Finally, fitting the NEOWISE and Spitzer data together requires unexpectedly large thermal inertias and gives a bimodal posterior diameter distribution."

Although Transformer-based methods excel at capturing global context, their quadratic computational complexity hinders real-time deployment. To address this, we propose Fourier Receptance Weighted Key Value (Fourier-RWKV), a novel dehazing framework based on a Multi-State Perception paradigm. The model achieves comprehensive haze degradation modeling with linear complexity by synergistically integrating three distinct perceptual states: (1) Spatial-form Perception, realized through the Deformable Quad-directional Token Shift (DQ-Shift) operation, which dynamically adjusts receptive fields to accommodate local haze variations; (2) Frequency-domain Perception, implemented within the Fourier Mix block, which extends the core WKV attention mechanism of RWKV from the spatial domain to the Fourier domain, preserving the long-range dependencies essential for global haze estimation while mitigating spatial attenuation; (3) Semantic-relation Perception, facilitated by the Semantic Bridge Module (SBM), which utilizes Dynamic Semantic Kernel Fusion (DSK-Fusion) to precisely align encoder-decoder features and suppress artifacts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Fourier-RWKV delivers state-of-the-art performance across diverse haze scenarios while significantly reducing computational overhead, establishing a favorable trade-off between restoration quality and practical efficiency.

To quantify the local stress field associated with pre-existing cracks, an orthogonal finite-element simulation matrix of 16 combinations is constructed. Distributions of maximum principal stress () at the surface crack tip and along the upper half of the crack bottom are evaluated using steady-state thermal loading and a linear-elastic constitutive model. Across all cases, pronounced tensile stress concentration occurs at both locations: the maximum ranges from 19.2 to 34.1 MPa at the crack surface end and from 17.2 to 29.4 MPa at the crack bottom. These concentrated values are consistently higher than the stress level at the same locations in an otherwise identical uncracked wall, clarifying how seasonal temperature gradients under restraint amplify local stresses around existing defects. The quantitative ranges reported here provide a basis for risk screening and for formulating practical mitigation measures (e.g., joint spacing and insulation strategies) in the design and operation of urban underground enclosure walls. In addition, three-dimensional simulations of randomly distributed internal voids show that adopting average forming temperature increases the peak tensile stress on void surfaces from 3.42 to 4.40 MPa at 10 deg C and from 5.98 to 6.96 MPa at -5 deg C, further highlighting the risk amplification effect of AFT under cold service conditions."

The primary objective was to maintain a failure rate below 5% and an average latency of under 1000 ms. The architecture leverages horizontal scaling, database sharding, and asynchronous communication via a message queue. Performance evaluation showed that 83% of the system's features (20 out of 24) met the specified performance targets. Key functionalities such as user profile management, activity tracking, and read-intensive prediction operations successfully achieved the desired performance. The system demonstrated the ability to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without issues, validating its scalability. The implementation of asynchronous communication using RabbitMQ proved crucial in minimizing the error rate for computationally intensive prediction requests, ensuring system reliability by queuing requests and preventing data loss under heavy load."

A key challenge is ensuring these AI agents are robust, excelling not only in familiar settings observed during training but also effectively generalising to previously unseen and varied scenarios. In this thesis, we harness methodologies from open-endedness and multi-agent learning to train and evaluate robust AI agents capable of generalising to novel environments, out-of-distribution inputs, and interactions with other co-player agents. We begin by introducing MiniHack, a sandbox framework for creating diverse environments through procedural content generation. Based on the game of NetHack, MiniHack enables the construction of new tasks for reinforcement learning (RL) agents with a focus on generalisation. We then present Maestro, a novel approach for generating adversarial curricula that progressively enhance the robustness and generality of RL agents in two-player zero-sum games. We further probe robustness in multi-agent domains, utilising quality-diversity methods to systematically identify vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art, pre-trained RL policies within the complex video game football domain, characterised by intertwined cooperative and competitive dynamics. Finally, we extend our exploration of robustness to the domain of LLMs. Here, our focus is on diagnosing and enhancing the robustness of LLMs against adversarial prompts, employing evolutionary search to generate a diverse range of effective inputs that aim to elicit undesirable outputs from an LLM. This work collectively paves the way for future advancements in AI robustness, enabling the development of agents that not only adapt to an ever-evolving world but also thrive in the face of unforeseen challenges and interactions."

Rewards are shaped using calibrated cross-entropy, removing label bias and aggregating across surface forms to improve transferability. The proposed method is evaluated on five diverse NLP benchmark datasets, covering sentiment, natural language inference, paraphrase, and commonsense reasoning, using three distinct language models: Qwen2-1.5B Instruct, TinyLlama-1.1B Chat, and Phi-1.5.

    "abstract": "Most post-training backdoor detection methods rely on attacked models exhibiting extreme outlier detection statistics for the target class of an attack, compared to non-target classes. However, these approaches may fail: (1) when some (non-target) classes are easily discriminable from all others, in which case they may naturally achieve extreme detection statistics (e.g., decision confidence); and (2) when the backdoor is subtle, i.e., with its features weak relative to intrinsic class-discriminative features. A key observation is that the backdoor target class has contributions to its detection statistic from both the backdoor trigger and from its intrinsic features, whereas non-target classes only have contributions from their intrinsic features. To achieve more sensitive detectors, we thus propose to suppress intrinsic features while optimizing the detection statistic for a given class. For non-target classes, such suppression will drastically reduce the achievable statistic, whereas for the target class the (significant) contribution from the backdoor trigger remains. In practice, we formulate a constrained optimization problem, leveraging a small set of clean examples from a given class, and optimizing the detection statistic while orthogonalizing with respect to the class's intrinsic features. We dub this plug-and-play approach Class Subspace Orthogonalization (CSO) and assess it against challenging mixed-label and adaptive attacks."

While it has been shown that hot Jupiters reinflate as their host stars brighten due to heating deep in planetary interiors, young hot Jupiters also exhibit signs of delayed cooling possibly related to heating closer to their surfaces. To investigate this tension, we enhance our previously published hot Jupiter thermal evolution model by adding a parameter that allows for both deep heating and delayed cooling. We fit our thermal evolution models to a homogeneous, physically self-consistent catalog of accurate and precise hot Jupiter system properties in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We find that hot Jupiters' interior cooling rates are reduced on average by 95\\%--98\\% compared to simpler anomalous heating models. The most plausible explanation for this inference is substantial shallow heating just below their radiative--convective boundaries that enables reinflation with much less deep heating. Shallow heating by Ohmic dissipation and/or temperature advection are therefore important components of accurate models of hot Jupiter atmospheres, especially in circulation models. If hot Jupiters are inflated primarily by shallow heating as we propose, then we predict that their observed phase curve offsets should increase with temperature in the range $T_{\\text{eq}}~\\lesssim1500~\\text{K}$, peak in the range $1500~\\text{K}~\\lesssim~T_{\\text{eq}}~\\lesssim~1800~\\text{K}$, and decrease in the range $T_{\\text{eq}}~\\gtrsim~1800~\\text{K}$."

Our benchmarks contain samples with the same semantic information in three modalities (image, text, mixed) and we show that state-of-the-art MLLMs cannot consistently reason over these different modalities. We evaluate 15 MLLMs and find that the degree of modality inconsistency varies substantially, even when accounting for problems with text recognition (OCR). Neither rendering text as image nor rendering an image as text solves the inconsistency. Even if OCR is correct, we find that visual characteristics (text colour and resolution, but not font) and the number of vision tokens have an impact on model performance. Finally, we find that our consistency score correlates with the modality gap between text and images, highlighting a mechanistic interpretation of cross-modal inconsistent MLLMs."

The variety of real-world applications makes it highly challenging to develop a single model capable of unifying the diverse range of input-constrained generation sub-tasks, such as those conditioned by element types, sizes, or their relationships. Current methods either address only a subset of these tasks or necessitate separate model parameters for different conditions, failing to offer a truly unified solution. In this paper, we propose UniLayDiff: a Unified Diffusion Transformer, that for the first time, addresses various content-aware layout generation tasks with a single, end-to-end trainable model. Specifically, we treat layout constraints as a distinct modality and employ Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer framework to capture the complex interplay between the background image, layout elements, and diverse constraints. Moreover, we integrate relation constraints through fine-tuning the model with LoRA after pretraining the model on other tasks. Such a schema not only achieves unified conditional generation but also enhances overall layout quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniLayDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across from unconditional to various conditional generation tasks and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model to unify the full range of content-aware layout generation tasks."

Here, we derive the complete DC intrinsic transport response functions up to third order in the applied electric field within Boltzmann theory that hold combined information about quantum geometry and band dispersion. We discuss the responses for multifold fermions at high-symmetry momenta in time-reversal symmetric crystals as well as their reduction by symmetry constraints. We exemplify in detail the cases of space group 213 and space group 199, which realize different multifold fermions, and show under which conditions these low-energy excitations can be differentially addressed through their bulk nonlinear responses, enabling nonlinear valley-tronics."

    "abstract": "Industrial maintenance is being transformed by the Internet of Things and edge computing, generating continuous data streams that demand real-time, adaptive decision-making under limited computational resources. While data stream mining (DSM) addresses this challenge, most methods assume fully supervised settings, yet in practice, ground-truth labels are often delayed or unavailable. This paper presents a collaborative DSM framework that integrates unsupervised anomaly detection with interactive, human-in-the-loop learning to support maintenance decisions. We employ an online Isolation Forest and enhance interpretability using incremental Partial Dependence Plots and a feature importance score, derived from deviations of Individual Conditional Expectation curves from a fading average, enabling users to dynamically reassess feature relevance and adjust anomaly thresholds. We describe the real-time implementation and provide initial results for fault detection in a Jacquard loom unit. Ongoing work targets continuous monitoring to predict and explain imminent bearing failures."

When platform policies clash with community values, communities have resisted through strikes, blackouts, and even migration to other platforms. Through such collective actions, communities have sometimes won concessions but these have frequently proved temporary. Prior research has investigated strike events and migration chains, but the processes by which community-platform conflict unfolds remain obscure. How do community-platform relationships deteriorate? How do communities organize collective action? How do participants proceed in the aftermath? We investigate a conflict between the Stack Exchange platform and community that occurred in 2023 around an emergency arising from the release of large language models (LLMs). Based on a qualitative thematic analysis of 2,070 messages on Meta Stack Exchange and 14 interviews with community members, we surface how the 2023 conflict was preceded by a long-term deterioration in the community-platform relationship driven in particular by the platform's disregard for the community's highly-valued participatory role in governance. Moreover, the platform's policy response to LLMs aggravated the community's sense of crisis triggering the strike mobilization. We analyze how the mobilization was coordinated through a tiered leadership and communication structure, as well as how community members pivoted in the aftermath. Building on recent theoretical scholarship in social computing, we use Hirshman's exit, voice and loyalty framework to theorize the challenges of community-platform relations evinced in our data. Finally, we recommend ways that platforms and communities can institute participatory governance to be durable and effective."

    "abstract": "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is commonly deployed in settings where agents are trained via self-play with homogeneous teammates, often using parameter sharing and a single policy architecture. This opens the question: to what extent do self-play PPO agents learn general coordination strategies grounded in the underlying game, compared to overfitting to their training partners' behaviors? This paper investigates the question using the Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Challenge (HeMAC) environment, which features distinct Observer and Drone agents with complementary capabilities. We introduce Rotating Policy Training (RPT), an approach that rotates heterogeneous teammate policies of different learning algorithms during training, to expose the agent to a broader range of partner strategies. When playing alongside a withheld teammate policy (DDQN), we find that RPT achieves similar performance to a standard self-play baseline, IPPO, where all agents were trained sharing a single PPO policy. This result indicates that in this heterogeneous multi-agent setting, the IPPO baseline generalizes to novel teammate algorithms despite not experiencing teammate diversity during training. This shows that a simple IPPO baseline may possess the level of generalization to novel teammates that a diverse training regimen was designed to achieve."

To this end, we introduce EcomBench, a holistic E-commerce Benchmark designed to evaluate agent performance in realistic e-commerce environments. EcomBench is built from genuine user demands embedded in leading global e-commerce ecosystems and is carefully curated and annotated through human experts to ensure clarity, accuracy, and domain relevance. It covers multiple task categories within e-commerce scenarios and defines three difficulty levels that evaluate agents on key capabilities such as deep information retrieval, multi-step reasoning, and cross-source knowledge integration. By grounding evaluation in real e-commerce contexts, EcomBench provides a rigorous and dynamic testbed for measuring the practical capabilities of agents in modern e-commerce."

    "abstract": "It has been hypothesized that human-level visual perception requires a generative approach in which internal representations result from inverting a decoder. Yet today's most successful vision models are non-generative, relying on an encoder that maps images to representations without decoder inversion. This raises the question of whether generation is, in fact, necessary for machines to achieve human-level visual perception. To address this, we study whether generative and non-generative methods can achieve compositional generalization, a hallmark of human perception. Under a compositional data generating process, we formalize the inductive biases required to guarantee compositional generalization in decoder-based (generative) and encoder-based (non-generative) methods. We then show theoretically that enforcing these inductive biases on encoders is generally infeasible using regularization or architectural constraints. In contrast, for generative methods, the inductive biases can be enforced straightforwardly, thereby enabling compositional generalization by constraining a decoder and inverting it. We highlight how this inversion can be performed efficiently, either online through gradient-based search or offline through generative replay. We examine the empirical implications of our theory by training a range of generative and non-generative methods on photorealistic image datasets. We find that, without the necessary inductive biases, non-generative methods often fail to generalize compositionally and require large-scale pretraining or added supervision to improve generalization. By comparison, generative methods yield significant improvements in compositional generalization, without requiring additional data, by leveraging suitable inductive biases on a decoder along with search and replay."

Namely, we say that an integral domain is \\emph{completely atomic} if every nonunit divisor of an atomic element is also atomic. We further consider several factorization properties associated with this notion. Then, we investigate the basic properties of such domains, provide examples, and explore the behavior of the completely atomic property under standard constructions such as localization, polynomial rings, and $D+M$ constructions. Our results highlight the independence of the completely atomic property from other classical factorization properties and introduce an important class of integral domains that lies between atomic and non-atomic domains."

Instead of a compact $3$-torus $T^3=\\mathbb{R}^3/Λ$ where $Λ$ is a crystallographic lattice, as done in previous work, here I considered flows confined in a cylinder with identified opposite bases. In this topology I considered axial symmetric flows and found a complete basis of axial symmetric harmonic $1$-forms that, for each energy level, decomposes into six components: two Beltrami, two anti-Beltrami and two closed forms. These objects, that are written in terms of trigonometric and Bessel functions, constitute a function basis for an $L^2$ space of axial symmetric flows. I have presented a general scheme for the search of axial symmetric solutions of Navier Stokes equation by reducing the latter to an hierachy of quadratic relations on the development coefficients of the flow in the above described functional basis. It is proposed that the coefficients can be determined by means of a Physics Informed like Neural Network optimization recursive algorithm. Indeed the present paper provides the theoretical foundations for such a algorithmic construction that is planned for a future publication."

First, we show that the topological entropy of $2^f$ is zero, i.e. $h_{top}(2^f)=0$ and that the set of almost periodic points coincides with the set of uniformly recurrent points, i.e. $AP(2^f)=UR(2^f)$. Furthermore, we prove that inside any infinite $ω$-limit set $ω_{2^f}(A)$ there is a unique minimal set and this minimal set is an adding machine. As a consequence, $(2^X,2^f)$ has no Devaney chaotic subsystems. In contrast to these rigidity properties, we obtain some results with chaotic flavor. In fact, we prove the following dichotomy, the hyperspace system $(2^X,2^f)$ is either equicontinuous or choatic with respect to Li-Yorke chaos and $ω$-chaos. It is shown that the later case occurs if and only if $R(2^f)\\setminus AP(2^f)\\neq\\emptyset$.

The CO and CN measurements were used to probe CNO abundances of these stars, and elemental abundance values from the literature were used to identify the trends of [C/N] and [O/N] with CN and CO. To put these measurements in context, we performed stellar atmosphere fitting to obtain estimates of stellar parameters, with a primary focus on effective temperature. Our measurements and temperature estimates show that CN is significantly affected by dredge-up of processed material. We provide discussion as to the potential nature of the recently confirmed classical Cepheid, ET~Vul, and connect our near-infrared CO measurements to the mid-infrared period-colour-metallicity relation."

Five dense clumps traced by N$_2$H$^+$(1--0) exhibit subsonic to transonic turbulence, contrasting with the supersonic motions of their parental filaments, indicating turbulence dissipation. A deficit of emission at \\vlsr $\\sim$\\,7\\kms\\! in several molecular lines, along with a blueshifted absorption dip in the HCN(1--0) profile, suggests that emission from OB-heated gas is being absorbed by a cold foreground cloud.

Upon doping, we find that Cooper pairs can emerge, whose fluctuations predominate the long-range physics in the system across a wide parameter range. The effective attractions between Cooper pairs are mediated by the particle-hole fluctuations in the third non-pairing component, resembling an excitonic mechanism of superconductivity. The coexistence of multiple density waves and superconductivity at different fermion fillings is explored. We also present an analytical study of the pairing mechanism in both weak and strong coupling limits.

Despite identical circuits, optimizers, and Hamiltonians, the new version produced drastically different results. A systematic analysis revealed the root cause: the sampling budget -- the number of circuit executions (shots) per iteration. The library's implicit use of unlimited shots yielded dense probability distributions, whereas the v2 default of 10 000 shots captured only 23% of the state space. Increasing shots to 250 000 restored library-level accuracy.

The nexus of topology orders, which engenders distinct quantum phases with benefits to both fundamental research and practical applications for future quantum devices, can be driven by topological phase transition through modulating intrinsic or extrinsic ordering parameters. The conjoined topology, however, is still elusive in experiments due to the lack of suitable material platforms. Here we use scanning tunneling microscopy, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations to investigate the doping-driven band structure evolution of a quasi-one-dimensional material system, bismuth halide, which contains rare multiple band inversions in two time-reversal-invariant momenta. According to the unique bulk-boundary correspondence in topological matter, we unveil a composite topological phase, the coexistence of a strong topological phase and a high-order topological phase, evoked by the band inversion associated with topological phase transition in this system. Moreover, we reveal multiple-stage topological phase transitions by varying the halide element ratio: from high-order topology to weak topology, the unusual dual topology, and trivial/weak topology subsequently. Our results not only realize an ideal material platform with composite topology, but also provide an insightful pathway to establish abundant topological phases in the framework of band inversion theory."

This work goes beyond the point-like idealisation and considers a sphere of finite radius. We find that the vanishing of the linear response coefficients ceases as they acquire a correction due to the finite size of the object. This introduces a hierarchy between the even and odd multipoles of the response coefficients determined by the separation of scales between the radius of the sphere and the screening scale of non-linearities. From a phenomenological viewpoint, the hierarchy between the odd and even multipoles would give access to the screening scale and the object's radius by measuring the behaviour of the potentials at infinity."

This task is complex and tedious, particularly for large and high-dimensional datasets, demanding an automatic system for discovering explanations (data regions and causes) of an observed disparity. It is critical that explanations for disparities are not only interpretable but also actionable-enabling users to make informed, data-driven decisions. This requires explanations to go beyond surface-level correlations and instead capture causal relationships. We introduce ExDis, a framework for discovering causal Explanations for Disparities between two groups of interest. ExDis identifies data regions (subpopulations) where disparities are most pronounced (or reversed), and associates specific factors that causally contribute to the disparity within each identified data region. We formally define the ExDis framework and the associated optimization problem, analyze its complexity, and develop an efficient algorithm to solve the problem. Through extensive experiments over three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that ExDis generates meaningful causal explanations, outperforms prior methods, and scales effectively to handle large, high-dimensional datasets."

    "abstract": "Since the 1990s, considerable empirical work has been carried out to train statistical models, such as neural networks (NNs), as learned heuristics for combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. When successful, such an approach eliminates the need for experts to design heuristics per problem type. Due to their structure, many hard CO problems are amenable to treatment through reinforcement learning (RL). Indeed, we find a wealth of literature training NNs using value-based, policy gradient, or actor-critic approaches, with promising results, both in terms of empirical optimality gaps and inference runtimes. Nevertheless, there has been a paucity of theoretical work undergirding the use of RL for CO problems. To this end, we introduce a unified framework to model CO problems through Markov decision processes (MDPs) and solve them using RL techniques. We provide easy-to-test assumptions under which CO problems can be formulated as equivalent undiscounted MDPs that provide optimal solutions to the original CO problems. Moreover, we establish conditions under which value-based RL techniques converge to approximate solutions of the CO problem with a guarantee on the associated optimality gap. Our convergence analysis provides: (1) a sufficient rate of increase in batch size and projected gradient descent steps at each RL iteration; (2) the resulting optimality gap in terms of problem parameters and targeted RL accuracy; and (3) the importance of a choice of state-space embedding. Together, our analysis illuminates the success (and limitations) of the celebrated deep Q-learning algorithm in this problem context."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a quantum-optical treatment of acceleration radiation for atoms freely falling into a Schwarzschild black hole when the ambient field is a massive spin-1 (Proca) field. Building on the HBAR framework of Scully and collaborators, we analyze two detector realizations: a charged-monopole current coupling and a physical electric-dipole coupling, both within a cavity that isolates a single outgoing Schwarzschild mode prepared in the Boulware state. Using a near-horizon stationary-phase analysis, we show that the thermal detailed-balance factor governing excitation versus absorption is universal and depends only on the near-horizon Rindler coordinate transformation. At the same time, the absolute spectra acquire distinctive Proca signatures: a hard mass threshold, polarization-dependent prefactors, and axial/polar greybody transmissions. Promoting single-pass probabilities to escaping rates yields a master equation whose steady state is geometric and whose entropy flux obeys an HBAR-style area-entropy relation identical in form to the scalar case, with all vector-field specifics entering through the radiative area change. Our results provide a controlled pathway to probe longitudinal versus transverse responses, mass thresholds, and polarization-resolved greybody effects in acceleration radiation, and set the stage for extensions to rotating backgrounds, alternative exterior states, and detector-engineering strategies."

    "abstract": "The Vera C. Rubin Observatory has now seen first light, and over a 10 year duration, LSST is projected to catalogue tens of millions of quasars, many of which are expected to be associated with sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). Out of these SMBHBs, up to thousands of relatively massive binary-quasars are expected to exhibit gravitational self-lensing flares (SLFs) that last for at least 20-30 days. We assess the effectiveness of the Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram and matched filters (MFs) as methods for systematic searches for these binaries, using toy-models of hydrodynamical, Doppler, and self-lensing variability from equal-mass, eccentric SMBHBs. We inject SLFs into random realizations of damped random walk (DRW) lightcurves, representing stochastic quasar variability, and compute the LS periodogram with and without the SLF. We find that periodograms of SLF+DRW light-curves do not have maximum peak heights that could not arise from DRW-only periodograms. On the other hand, the matched filter signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can distinguish SLFs from noise even with LSST-like cadences and DRW noise. Furthermore, we develop a three-step procedure with matched filters, which can also recover injected binary parameters from these light-curves. We expect this method to be computationally efficient enough to be applicable to millions of quasar light-curves in LSST."

Although the classical $L_p$-discrepancy suffers from the curse of dimensionality for all $p \\in (1,\\infty)$, the gap between known upper and lower bounds remains substantial, in particular for small $p \\ge 1$. To clarify this picture, we review the existing results for i.i.d.\\ uniformly distributed points and derive new upper bounds for \\emph{generalized} $L_p$-discrepancies, obtained by allowing non-uniform sampling densities and corresponding non-negative quadrature weights. Using the probabilistic method, we show that random points drawn from optimally chosen product densities lead to significantly improved upper bounds. For $p=2$ these bounds are explicit and optimal; for general $p \\in [1,\\infty)$ we obtain sharp asymptotic estimates. The improvement can be interpreted as a form of importance sampling for the underlying Sobolev space $F_{d,q}$. Our results also reveal that, even with optimal densities, the curse of dimensionality persists for random points when $p\\ge 1$, and it becomes most pronounced for small $p$. This suggests that the curse should also hold for the classical $L_1$-discrepancy for deterministic point sets."

In this work, we introduce an ordinal odor strength data set of over 2,000 molecules by integrating two different public sources, mapping structures to odorless, low, medium, and high categories. Across several molecular encodings and supervised learning algorithms we compared different prediction strategies. Dimensionality reduction and SHAP analysis identifies molecular size, polarity, ring features, and branching as primary drivers, consistent with mass-transport constraints on volatility, sorption, and receptor access. This scalable ordinal framework enables reliable odor-strength estimation for novel molecules and provides a foundation for in silico fragrance design."

The relevance of such experiments relies on dimensional analysis and the principle of dynamic similarity. However, transferring controllers to full-scale systems often requires additional tuning. In this paper, we propose a method to enable a direct controller transfer using dimensionless model predictive control, tuned automatically for closed-loop performance. With this reformulation, the closed-loop behavior of an optimized controller transfers directly to a new, dynamically similar system. Additionally, the dimensionless formulation allows for the use of data from systems of different scales during parameter optimization. We demonstrate the method on a cartpole swing-up and a car racing problem, applying either reinforcement learning or Bayesian optimization for tuning the controller parameters.

We present the first detailed spectral and timing analysis of the TeV blazar Mrk~421 based on 45 X-ray observations from the \\textit{NICER} X-ray telescope, collected over two years from 2022 to 2024. The source exhibits strong X-ray variability across intraday and long-term timescales. During this period, we observe a dramatic change in flux, from $\\sim 50$ to $\\sim 1380$~counts~s$^{-1}$, representing a $\\sim 28$-fold increase. Spectral modeling with power-law, broken power-law, and log-parabolic functions shows that the log-parabola provides the most accurate description of the X-ray spectra. The hardness ratio analysis confirms a \\textit{harder-when-brighter} trend, consistent with the anticorrelation between flux and both $Γ$ and $α$. Correlation studies reveal a positive relation between $α$ and $β$, a negative correlation between $β$ and synchrotron peak energy $E_{\\mathrm{p}}$, and a positive correlation between $E_{\\mathrm{p}}$ and flux. These observed features can be interpreted within the framework of energy-dependent particle acceleration in blazar jets, which are often associated with turbulence, strong magnetic fields, and relativistic outflows. This work demonstrates that observations from \\textit{NICER} can play an important role in blazar variability studies and motivate future multiwavelength campaigns aimed at fully characterizing the dynamical processes in relativistic jets."

Their near-field operating regime requires channel models that jointly capture line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) components in a physically consistent manner. Existing studies typically treat these components separately or rely on environment-specific multipath models. In this work, we develop a unified LoS+NLoS channel representation for holographic lines that integrates spatial-sampling-based and expansion-based formulations. Building on this model, we extend the wavenumber-division multiplexing (WDM) framework, originally introduced for purely LoS channels, to the LoS+NLoS scenario. Applying WDM to the NLoS component yields its angular-domain representation, enabling direct characterization through the power spectral factor and power spectral density. We further derive closed-form characterizations for isotropic and non-isotropic scattering, with the former recovering Jakes' isotropic model. Lastly, we evaluate the resulting degrees of freedom and ergodic capacity, showing that incorporating the NLoS component substantially improves the performance relative to the purely LoS case."

    "abstract": "The EUV late phase is the second increase of the irradiance of the warm coronal lines during solar flares, and has a crucial impact on the Earth's ionosphere. In this paper, we report on the extremely energetic EUV late phase of a pair of C-class flares (SOL2012-06-17T17:26:11) observed on 2012 June 17 in NOAA active region 11504 by the \\textit{Atmospheric Imaging Assembly} (AIA) instrument on board the \\textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory} (SDO). The light curves integrated over the flaring region show that a factor of 4.2 more energy is released in the ``warm'' (2$-$3$\\times 10^6$~K) temperature passbands (e.g. AIA 335 Å) during the late phase than during the main peaks. The origin of the emission in this extremely energetic EUV late phase is a non-eruptive sigmoid situated in a multi-polar magnetic field configuration, which is rapidly energised by C-class flares. The sigmoid plasma appears to reach temperatures in excess of $10^7$~K, before cooling to produce the EUV late-phase emission. This is seen in high-temperature passbands (e.g. AIA 131 Å) and by using differential emission measure analysis. Magnetic extrapolations indicate that the sigmoid is consistent with formation by magnetic reconnection between previously existing J-shaped loops. The sigmoid experienced a fast and a slow cooling stages, both of which were dominated by conductive cooling. The estimated total cooling time of the sigmoid is shorter than the observed value. So, we proposed that the non-eruptive sigmoid, heated by the continuous magnetic reconnection, leads to the extremely energetic EUV late phase."

D4RT utilizes a unified transformer architecture to jointly infer depth, spatio-temporal correspondence, and full camera parameters from a single video. Its core innovation is a novel querying mechanism that sidesteps the heavy computation of dense, per-frame decoding and the complexity of managing multiple, task-specific decoders. Our decoding interface allows the model to independently and flexibly probe the 3D position of any point in space and time. The result is a lightweight and highly scalable method that enables remarkably efficient training and inference.

Here we show that supersolidity can also emerge from mode coupling at a superfluid-solid interface, without modifying bulk interactions and for a broad class of superfluids. Using an analytical and numerical treatment of the coupled superfluid and phonon fields, we derive the criterion for a density-modulation instability driven by interfacial coupling and dependent on dimensionality. In superfluid helium, the instability first appears at the roton mode, while in a Bose-Einstein condensate with contact interactions it occurs at the lowest accessible wave vector set by the system size. Beyond the threshold, the ground state acquires an interfacial density modulation while the bulk remains superfluid, forming a hybrid superfluid-supersolid phase. Our results identify interfacial mode coupling as a promising route to supersolidity, enabling the simultaneous exploitation of interfacial supersolid and bulk superfluid quantum properties."

In superluminal scenarios, neutrinos can decay through vacuum $e^-e^+$ pair emission or neutrino splitting. Previous analyses of the KM3-230213A event relied on simplified survival-probability estimates and, in some cases, used inaccurate decay-width expressions or neglected redshift and threshold effects. In this work we present a unified and self-consistent framework that corrects these issues and applies to both the energy-independent ($n=0$) and quadratic ($n=2$) superluminal cases. We collect and recast the decay-width and threshold expressions, clarify their flavor dependence, and include a consistent treatment of cosmological propagation. We also assess the impact of cascade regeneration and show that cascade effects are negligible for the purpose of setting LIV bounds. The survival-probability approximation adopted in previous works is therefore justified, while our framework provides a coherent basis for future analyses of superluminal neutrino constraints, which should consistently include possible time-delay signatures."

    "abstract": "Wake-up radios (WuRx) are increasingly adopted in ultra-low-power wireless systems to enable energy-efficient, event-driven communication, particularly within the context of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Their ability to remain in a low-power listening state and activate the main transceiver only when necessary makes them a critical component in scenarios where energy autonomy and long operational lifetimes are essential.Designing and validating such receivers at system level requires accurate simulation tools that can capture the impact of analog and Radio-Frequency (RF) non-idealities without the high computational cost associated with full transistor-level modeling. In this work, we present a complete and modular set of behavioral models, implemented in Advanced Design System (ADS), for simulating the full RF receiver front-end of a WuRx operating at 2.4 GHz. The modeled blocks include a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA), a Frequency-Locked Loop (FLL)-based local oscillator, a passive Mixer, a Variable Gain Amplifier (VGA) governed by an Automatic Gain Control (AGC) loop, and a 7-bit Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). Each behavioral block is derived from bottom-up performance data obtained through transistor-level simulations carried out in an 18 nm FDSOI CMOS technology node. This enables realistic performance representation within the system-level environment. The proposed methodology allows for fast and flexible co-simulation of the entire analog receive chain, supporting efficient architectural exploration, early-stage validation, and algorithm development. By significantly reducing simulation time while preserving high fidelity, this approach provides a practical and scalable solution for the design and optimization of low-power WuRx front-ends under realistic operating conditions."

Secondly, in multi-user query scenarios, independent search tokens and unique query trapdoors were constructed based on ciphertext search technology. Meanwhile, lightweight verifiable computation is integrated to ensure the accuracy of the results.

    "abstract": "Oscillation detection technology is a necessary tool to inform operators about potential power system stability and reliability threats, enabling them to make immediate decisions to mitigate the consequences. However, the detection tools usually extensively rely on baselining, and performing experiments with historical data to establish reliable thresholds. In this paper, we propose an Oscillation Presence Index (OPI), which is computed by characterizing patterns in the power spectral density (PSD) using information theoretic-based concepts. The index provides a standardized 0-to-1 measure of oscillation presence, offering a consistent detection metric for operational use. This method exhibits minimal reliance on historical data for baselining or tuning parameters and demonstrates robustness against transients or sudden step changes without triggering alarms—a common issue that often leads to false positives. Additionally, it can be easily configured to adjust frequency bands or the number of bands, making it adaptable to different user preferences. Moreover, we introduce a software architecture to implement the proposed technique in real-time through interaction with databases and visualization dashboards. Several real-world PMU datasets are tested to verify the efficacy of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Patients with motor speech disorders like dysarthria, Parkinson's, or stroke often present with lower speech intelligibility, making everyday communication difficult. Here, we introduce a modular and interpretable pathway for pathological-to-healthy speech restoration in the absence of parallel training material. The pathway is comprised of three phases: (1) A Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) architecture designed to correct distorted Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), producing smooth trajectories characteristic of healthy-sounding speech; (2) a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM)-based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) architecture to recover linguistic content; and (3) a FastSpeech 2 in conjunction with HiFi-GAN text-to-speech system trained on clean samples for high-fidelity synthesis. Tests on the UASpeech database affirm that the proposed framework outperforms existing baselines in terms of intelligibility and demonstrates substantial robustness to both speaker variability and data sparsity. The modular nature facilitates clinically pertinent release for restoration in assistive applications."

    "abstract": "Affected by the Moon's low gravity and complex terrain, traditional wheeled and legged robots struggle to balance terrain adaptability and locomotion efficiency, thereby limiting their applicability in lunar missions. To enhance multitask operation capabilities on the lunar surface, this paper proposes a novel biomimetic wheeled-legged mobile robotic system, adopting a four-bar linkage wheeled-leg structure driven by a dual-motor coaxial nested configuration. This design ensures high terrain adaptability and locomotion efficiency. Furthermore, the kinematic and dynamic models of the robot are established, and the safe operational workspace of the wheeled-leg system is analyzed. To address attitude disturbances caused by complex lunar terrains, a self-balancing control strategy based on position feedback and force feedback loops is developed. Simulation results show that, under biaxial asymmetric sinusoidal disturbances, the robot's attitude fluctuations are effectively controlled within <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\pm 1^{\\circ}$</tex> (pitch) and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\pm 0.6^{\\circ}$</tex> (roll), demonstrating good dynamic leveling performance of the system.

In our empirical analysis, we evaluated the proposed SVRMAPE on Boston Housing dataset, and also ran confirmatory experiments on a second public dataset and an industrial energy load series. Over 30 randomized train/test splits, this method reduced the test-set MAPE by 12−18% compared to tuned XGBoost, random forest, and kernel-SVR baselines, while also matching or enhancing <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$R^{2}$</tex> and RMSE.

Consequently, this formulation serves as a seamless replacement for practitioners who prioritize scale-free accuracy metrics."

However, current magnetically actuated soft microrobots still face multiple technical challenges in complex, dynamic liquid environments. Their limited degrees of freedom and inferior flexibility and maneuverability compared to natural aquatic organisms, such as fish, restrict their ability to swim effectively in intricate hydrodynamic conditions. In this work, we present a soft microrobotic swimmer capable of multimodal locomotion, biomimicking both tadpole-like undulatory and sperm-like helical propulsion. This dual-mode actuation enables efficient navigation through diverse challenging environments, including simulated vasculature, narrow channels, and countercurrent flows. Furthermore, we systematically optimize the robot's structural design by quantitatively investigating key parameters, such as the head-to-tail ratio, thickness profile, and magnetization orientation, to achieve superior swimming performance. Our findings provide insights into the development of advanced untethered microrobots for biomedical and environmental applications."

This paper introduces a novel energy management strategy, Federated LSTM, that integrates federated learning with long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to prioritize consumer services based on load criticality. By categorizing electrical consumption into essential and nonessential loads, the proposed approach enables decentralized, privacy-preserving forecasting and energy distribution optimization. The Federated LSTM model is trained on distributed smart meters, enabling real-time adaptation to consumption patterns while preserving data privacy. The results demonstrate that the model effectively prioritizes critical loads during extreme events, reducing energy delivery delays by 30% compared to traditional centralized methods. This research contributes to the growing field of smart grid management by introducing a scalable, privacy-sensitive solution for power distribution in critical scenarios."

This paper explores how the instruction set of RISC-V-based microcontrollers can be extended at runtime using reconfigurable hardware accelerators and the SCAIE-V framework. Building on a flexible infrastructure based on dynamic partial reconfiguration and a scalable, standardized instruction interface within the pipeline, we demonstrate the integration of application-specific accelerators without sacrificing general-purpose capabilities. The experimental proof of concept based on the ASCON lightweight cryptographic algorithm validates the approach across two soft microcontrollers. With this, we showcase the usage of a software fallback mechanism to support seamless hardware/software transitions and enable memory handover between the software and hardware execution domains. The results show clear advantages in execution time and flexibility over static hardware designs while supporting long-term maintainability and sustainability through hardware reuse."

    "abstract": "As the integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) increases in power grids, Inverter-based Resources (IBRs) are becoming more prevalent. Hence, there is a crucial need to integrate power-electronic devices, i.e. Voltage Source Converters (VSCs) to exchange power with the grid. Sources integrated with power electronics differ in principle from conventional Synchronous Machines (SMs) in the sense that they lack rotational inertia and utilize a driving circuit to synthesize the frequency. To control the operation of VSCs, prior work suggested control schemes that implement Virtual Inertia (VI) using assumptions of equating DC-link dynamics to the swing equation. The proposed work, based on the definition of \"virtual frequency\" for VI synthesis and damping, derives a mathematical relation between the swing equation and the mismatch of power between the converter’s DC and AC sides, for a more fundamentally accurate emulation of the rotor dynamics. The proposed method has demonstrated promising results regarding the scheme’s effectiveness in damping frequency oscillations following disturbances in MATLAB/Simulink® simulations."

    "abstract": "Limitations of the Global Positioning System (GPS) in indoor environments have led to the development of Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS). Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is widely used due to its affordability and accessibility. However, BLE-based systems often suffer from accuracy issues caused by fluctuations and interference. Moreover, many existing systems are costly, complex, and limited to single-target tracking. To address these challenges, researchers have explored collaborative IPS (CIPS) that combine multiple sensing technologies. This study demonstrated another approach by combining BLE and millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar technologies by fusing BLE Receive Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and In-phase Quadrature (IQ) data with mmWave radar outputs using a Random Forest (RF) algorithm. This approach focuses on enhancing the performance of BLE-based IPS by integrating mmWave radar, which addresses BLE's limitations in precision, while BLE extends the coverage and reduces false detections of mmWave-based IPS by matching the number of targets to BLE tags. Although the fusion increases system complexity and cost, it was able to improve BLE-based IPS accuracy, remove false detections, and distinguish targets from each other. Additionally, weighted averaging proves optimal for single-target tracking, while midpoint calculation performs better for multi-target detection for aggregation. The fused system (mmBLE) has an RMSE of 0.5597m, outperforming BLE-only models and approaching mmWave-only accuracy, with RMSEs of 2.0066m (BLE - 4 anchors), 0.1140m (mmWave - 2 anchors)."

    "abstract": "To provide the necessary bias voltage for Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) sensors within the second module of the DUNE (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment) far detector, it is essential to design power supply systems capable of delivering highly stable and low-noise voltages. While conventional designs allow these power units to be positioned outside the time projection chambers filled with liquid argon (LAr), the vertical drift configuration of DUNE introduces new constraints.In this design, the Photon Detection System (PDS) electronics, including readout and biasing components, must be integrated directly onto the cathode plane, which operates at a high DC potential of -300 kV. Due to this, direct electrical links between the SiPMs and external control or power interfaces are not feasible. Instead, energy is transmitted via optical fibers using a Power over Fiber (PoF) approach.PoF systems typically output only a few volts, with voltage levels varying according to the load current. The SiPMs intended for use in this setup require a 48 V DC bias, although alternative models from other manufacturers may require a 36 V DC supply. To address this, the solution presented in this work introduces a cryogenically operable step-up DC-DC converter designed to generate a stable, ultra-low-noise 48 V output. Additionally, the output voltage can be dynamically adjusted using a dedicated control signal transmitted via optical fiber.The proposed converter employs a boost topology with components specifically chosen and tested for reliable operation at cryogenic temperatures. Regulation is managed through an analog control system based on a Type III compensator, ensuring precise voltage control under varying conditions."

When compared to a no-storage baseline and to the Monte Carlo method used as a benchmark, the genetic algorithm consistently outperforms in terms of revenue, stability, and convergence speed, achieving average daily revenue increases of up to 48.03 % relative to the no-storage scenario, and an additional improvement of 22.5 % over the benchmark method.

These seizures, marked by fleeting irregularities in the brain's electrical activity, often occur without warning and can lead to lapses in attention or full-body convulsions, increasing the risk of physical harm and even death. Physicians, hindered by the rarity and unpredictability of seizures, rely on accounts from individuals with epilepsy, caregivers, and witnesses for crucial information on seizure descriptions, triggers, frequency, and daily life impact. In response to these challenges, this study advocates for innovative solutions, highlighting the potential of wearable technology, particularly smartwatches. These devices facilitate self-monitoring through various metrics, such as heart rate and oxygen level, and enable two-way communication with healthcare professionals and family members. The researchers developed a real-time seizure detection and response system, utilizing modern smartwatch capabilities like heart rate monitoring and GPS functionality. The proposed system aims to detect seizures' onset and transmit accurate location data to designated contacts via SMS. Rapid notifications empower relatives and caregivers to respond promptly, potentially preventing injuries and complications. Additionally, the system seeks to create a comprehensive database of seizure occurrences and frequencies, offering invaluable assistance to healthcare professionals in optimizing epilepsy management."

Despite these advances, most existing DRL-based methods use velocity commands as control references, which often result in limited gait diversity and a lack of global navigation capability. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework that leverages a sequence of target points as navigation references. This framework allows the robot to autonomously plan its gait and velocity based on the navigation goal, thereby achieving more flexible and adaptive locomotion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional velocity-command-based strategies in terms of both locomotion speed and gait diversity."

Finally, we conduct a series of experiments to validate the system's feasibility. The results demonstrate that the system can achieve precise deployment through the target window at various heights and speeds, with an average success rate of approximately 69 %. This novel bionic projectile-throwing method provides a new approach for highrise fire suppression."

    "abstract": "General movement assessment (GMA) is a non-invasive method used to evaluate neuromotor behavior in infants under six months of age and is considered a reliable tool for the early detection of cerebral palsy (CP). However, traditional GMA relies on the subjective judgment of multiple internationally certified physicians, making it time-consuming and limiting its accessibility for widespread use. Furthermore, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches may overcome these limitations but are usually based on motion skeletons and lack the ability to capture detailed body information. Here, we propose CoGMA (Collaborative General Movements Assessment), a novel multi-modality co-learning framework for GMA. By integrating multimodal large language model as auxiliary network during training, CoGMA incorporates four types of input data—skeleton data, clinical information, RGB video, and text descriptions—to enhance representation learning. During inference, however, CoGMA achieves efficient and accurate prediction using only skeleton data and clinical information. Experimental evaluations indicate that CoGMA demonstrates robust performance across both the writhing and fidgety movement stages, while also excelling in zero-shot evaluation of fidget movement, thereby mitigating the issue of limited training samples in this stage. This framework significantly enhances the GMA methodology and lays the groundwork for future advancements in early detection and research on infant neuromotor behavior. Additionally, to facilitate anonymized data sharing, we introduce InfantAnimator, a tool that generates non-identifiable videos while preserving essential motion features, thereby supporting broader research and collaboration.

    "abstract": "The ocean is a geometrically dispersive medium for acoustic waves due to the depth dependence of the index of refraction. For broadband signals, dispersion results in signal distortion that increases with the distance from the transmitter. This article considers the estimation of modal group delay from broadband tomographic transmissions in the presence of distortion caused by dispersion. The received signal is characterized by delay and dispersiveness parameters which are both considered to be unknown. The modal group delay can be then estimated in a straightforward manner by maximizing the output of a matched filter over a set of replica wave forms. This is directly analogous to the common signal processing problem of joint delay and Doppler estimation. The replica energy is independent of the dispersiveness parameter, so for an additive white Gaussian noise model the maximum of the matched filter output is the maximum likelihood estimator of delay (and dispersiveness). An improved signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 6 dB at the receiver and unbiased modal group delay estimation is demonstrated on a 35-Hz broadband source in simulations and on data from the coordinated arctic acoustic thermometry experiment."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence techniques have been extensively employed in anomaly detection tasks for massive systems and equipment across numerous industries, achieving notable success. Nevertheless, classical machine learning methods typically possess a simplistic design, which occasionally fails to satisfy the detection demands of minor anomalies in certain complex tasks. Conversely, the interpretability of deep learning methods is often insufficient to convince domain experts and operators. Consequently, achieving a balance between detection accuracy and interpretability remains a critical and often conflicting challenge. This article proposes an expert experience-based algorithm unfolding (EAU) network and a conditional canonical correlation analysis (CCCA) theory for anomaly detection of spacecraft under multiple operating conditions, aiming to ensure detection accuracy while enhancing interpretability. First, the EAU network integrates the experiential knowledge with the Lasso regression model and employs sparse coding to iteratively expand it layer by layer (LbL), facilitating deep feature extraction from the original telemetry data. Second, the CCCA method formulates the residual vector on the premise that the correlation between the regularization components of the input and output sets will change markedly before and after the anomaly appears. It subsequently compares the Hotelling <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</i><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> statistic of each sample with the detection threshold, which was constructed based on the kernel density estimation (KDE) method, to discover the evolution of the anomaly. Finally, multigroup comparisons on two simulations and two real satellite-telemetry datasets verify the superior overall performance of the proposed method and provide guidance for selecting anomaly detection approaches."

    "abstract": "Although data visualization is powerful for revealing patterns and communicating insights, creating effective visualizations requires familiarity with authoring tools and often disrupts the analysis flow. While large language models show promise for automatically converting analysis intent into visualizations, existing methods function as black boxes without transparent reasoning processes, which prevents users from understanding design rationales and refining suboptimal outputs. To bridge this gap, we propose integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the Natural Language to Visualization (NL2VIS) pipeline. First, we design a comprehensive CoT reasoning process for NL2VIS and develop an automatic pipeline to equip existing datasets with structured reasoning steps. Second, we introduce nvBench-CoT, a specialized dataset capturing detailed step-by-step reasoning from ambiguous natural language descriptions to finalized visualizations, which enables state-of-the-art performance when used for model fine-tuning. Third, we develop DeepVIS, an interactive visual interface that tightly integrates with the CoT reasoning process, allowing users to inspect reasoning steps, identify errors, and make targeted adjustments to improve visualization outcomes. Quantitative benchmark evaluations, two use cases, and a user study collectively demonstrate that our CoT framework effectively enhances NL2VIS quality while providing insightful reasoning steps to users."

Unlike conventional offline 3D detectors that remain fixed during inference, TTC enables immediate online error correction without retraining, allowing autonomous vehicles to adapt to new scenarios and reduce deployment risks. To achieve this, we equip existing 3D detectors with an Online Adapter (OA) module-a prompt-driven query generator for real-time correction. At the core of OA module are visual prompts: image-based descriptions of objects of interest derived from auxiliary feedback such as mismatches with 2D detections, road descriptions, or user clicks. These visual prompts, collected from risky objects during inference, are maintained in a visual prompt buffer to enable continuous correction in future frames. By leveraging this mechanism, TTC consistently detects risky objects, achieving reliable, adaptive, and versatile driving autonomy. Extensive experiments show that TTC significantly improves instant error rectification over frozen 3D detectors, even under limited labels, zero-shot settings, and adverse conditions. We hope this work inspires future research on post-deployment online rectification systems for autonomous driving."

    "abstract": "Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is considered to be the ultimate solution to communication security. However, current QKD devices, especially quantum photon sources, are expensive, and they can generate secret keys only at a low rate. In this paper, we first consider homogeneous trusted-relay-based QKD networks where every request has the same amount of secret key requirement and every photon source has the same key distribution rate, and design an approach named RPSP to not only minimize the number of photon sources needed in a network to ensure at least one feasible relay path exists for any potential QKD requests but also save the time to complete a batch of QKD requests by jointly optimizing the routing of relay paths and the provisioning of photon sources to distribute secret keys. Then, we extend RPSP to RPSP-HN which can be applied to heterogeneous networks where requests have different secret key requirements and photon sources distribute keys at different rates. Furthermore, we also extend RPSP to RPSP-HY, which considers that some of the nodes in a network is untrusted. Compared with existing works, RPSP and its extensions focus on more practical scenarios where only some of the nodes are equipped with photon sources and they leverage optical switching to enable dynamic photon source provisioning such that we can utilize QKD devices more efficiently. Extensive simulations show that compared with baseline schemes, RPSP, RPSP-HN, and RPSP-HY can save up to 33%, 37%, and 25% of the time to complete a batch of QKD requests in homogeneous, heterogeneous, and hybrid QKD networks, respectively."

However, 3D printing soft robotic actuators and grippers using highly-flexible TPU (Shore hardness of 60A and 70A) remains unexplored. Although 60A and 70A TPUs are expected to provide excellent features for soft robots, designing and simulating soft robots using these TPU grades requires information about their best-fitting hyperelastic model, parameters, and material properties, which are hitherto unknown. Therefore, we characterize the 60A and 70A TPU behavior using uniaxial tensile tests and identify the best-fitting hyperelastic model with its appropriate parameters. We then demonstrated the feasibility of using these materials by 3D printing high-fidelity soft grippers using 60A and 70A TPU. Compared to a traditional silicone-based soft gripper of a similar size and shape, the proposed 3D printed TPU soft gripper can grasp objects over five times heavier and achieve more than twice the bending angle, while significantly reducing fabrication time and complexity. We also compared the bending angles of 60A and 70A TPU with 85A TPU soft fingers to demonstrate the importance of low-Shore-hardness materials. Furthermore, we compared the experimentally measured bending behavior of the TPU soft fingers with simulation results using the obtained hyperelastic parameters and found that they closely match the experimental results."

However, resource constraints of most IIoT devices prevent the use of conventional security models. Multi-access mobile edge computing (MEC) offers a solution by bringing computational resources closer to the network edge, but centralized security solutions limit scalability and flexibility in MEC-enabled IIoT systems. Additionally, the distributed nature of MEC servers poses data privacy and security challenges. This paper introduces a novel network security approach for IIoT using federated blockchain (FB) and a machine learning-based verification system (ML). MEC optimizes the FB model, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality between the IIoT's local network cluster and external devices. Public key cryptography secures data shared within the local network cluster, and the ML-based verification model validates IIoT devices requesting encryption key-pair updates and joining the MEC's FB. This integrated approach surpasses conventional security solutions by enhancing scalability, data privacy, and adaptability to the evolving IIoT network topology. The methodology is implemented and evaluated using a realistic IoT testbed, demonstrating improved network security while maintaining MEC-enabled IIoT system performance and scalability."

To this end, we propose a novel sensorimotor policy that uses stereo-vision depth and visual-inertial odometry (VIO) to autonomously navigate through obstacles in an unknown environment to reach a goal point. The policy is comprised of a pre-trained autoencoder as the perception head followed by a planning and control LSTM network which outputs velocity commands that can be followed by an off-the-shelf commercial drone. We leverage reinforcement and privileged learning paradigms to train the policy in simulation through a two-stage process: 1) initial training with optimal trajectories generated by a global motion planner acting as a supervisory backbone, 2) further fine-tuning in a curriculum environment. To bridge the sim-to-real gap, we employ domain randomization and reward shaping to create a policy that is both robust to noise and domain shift. In outdoor experiments, our approach achieves successful zero-shot transfer to both obstacle environments and a drone platform that were never encountered during training."

    "abstract": "Vehicular Fog Computing (VFC) is significantly enhancing the efficiency, safety, and computational capabilities of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), and the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) further elevates these advantages by incorporating flexible and auxiliary services. This evolving UAV-integrated VFC paradigm opens new doors while presenting unique complexities within the cooperative computation framework. Foremost among the challenges, modeling the intricate dynamics of aerial-ground interactive computing networks is a significant endeavor, and the absence of a comprehensive and flexible simulation platform may impede the exploration of this field. Inspired by the pressing need for a versatile tool, this paper provides a lightweight and modular aerial-ground collaborative simulation platform, termed <monospace xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">AirFogSim</monospace>. We present the design and implementation of AirFogSim, and demonstrate its versatility with five key missions in the domain of UAV-integrated VFC. A multifaceted use case is carried out to validate AirFogSim's effectiveness, encompassing several integral aspects of the proposed AirFogSim, including UAV trajectory, task offloading, resource allocation, and blockchain. In general, AirFogSim is envisioned to set a new precedent in the UAV-integrated VFC simulation, bridge the gap between theoretical design and practical validation, and pave the way for future intelligent transportation domains.

First, we introduce the so-called hybrid system in detail, and give the algebraic form of the system utilizing the semi-tensor product (STP, i.e., Cheng product) of matrices. Next, a new stability concept for the hybrid system is proposed by extending the definitions of set stability and exponential stability. After that, several stability criteria are presented by employing Lyapunov-like functions and STP. Accordingly, the stability conditions in some special cases are derived. Finally, the theoretical results are illustrated by some numerical examples."

Specifically, phase fluctuations caused by coronal turbulence and solar noise distort the optical signal’s phase, further degrading signal propagation and overall communication performance. This paper investigates a deep-space optical communication system designed for operation during solar conjunction by jointly accounting for coronal turbulence, pointing errors, and solar noise. An analytical expression for the average block error rate (BLER) of free-space optical links over an exponentiated Weibull turbulence channel is derived to evaluate system performance. Theoretical expressions are further validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, numerical results reveal the influence mechanisms of various parameters, providing both quantitative and qualitative descriptions of their impact on BLER performance."

    "abstract": "The deployment of 5G networks, leveraging technologies like massive MIMO and beamforming, has transformed signal propagation by introducing dynamic and directional transmission patterns. While these advances improve spectral efficiency, the complexity of evaluating exposure to Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Field (RF-EMF) increased, rendering traditional compliance methods overly conservative. To address this, recent international standards on RF-EMF calculations and measurements have introduced statistical approaches that better reflect real-world operating conditions by accounting for temporal variability in traffic load and beam patterns. This paper presents a novel extension to the effective maximum approach defined by IEC (International Electrotechnical Committee) by incorporating spatial dynamics derived from real-time base station measurements. These measurements are stored in counters that capture the three-dimensional (3D) power distribution of transmitted signals, enabling a more accurate representation of actual operating conditions. Two innovative methodologies are proposed (semi-vectorial and vectorial), both resulting in a more realistic estimation of RF-EMF exposure with respect to currently used methodologies. Each method uses different power reduction factors to reflect how signals change over time and space. Unlike existing models, the two new approaches capture the full spatio-temporal complexity of 5G emissions, offering a first-of-its-kind framework for realistic RF-EMF exposure assessment. A real-world case study demonstrates that this methodology significantly reduces conservatism in compliance boundaries, without compromising safety. These insights are particularly valuable for regulators and policymakers, enabling more accurate and proportionate exposure assessment methodologies that support the safe and efficient deployment of 5G and future wireless technologies."

Firstly, we propose a jamming-assisted (JA) framework for enhancing the physical layer security performance and derive analytical expressions for the secrecy outage probabilities (SOPs) of the downlink users and the system SOP (SSOP) of the CNOMA network for both JA and no-jammer (NJ) scenarios. It is illustrated that the proposed JA framework offers several key benefits: (i) a significant reduction in the SOPs and SSOP, (ii) a notable increase in system secrecy throughput (SST) and secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) for the network, and (iii) a complete alleviation of the zero-diversity order problem, if the transceivers are free of RHI. Following this, the optimal power allocation coefficients for the users at the base station and at the relay that independently as well as jointly minimize the SSOP of the JA-CNOMA network are determined. We demonstrate that the proposed approach results in: (i) considerable decrease of SSOP and SOPs and (ii) significant enhancement of SST and SEE of the JA-CNOMA network, compared to equal/random power allocation methods."

    "abstract": "Renewable energy sources (RESs) are highly integrated into today's distribution systems to provide a clean and sustainable supply for electric load demands. However, due to radial configuration, voltage limits, equipment capacity, and other constraints, a portion of RESs' output power is inevitably curtailed, which is undesirable given the clean and fuel-free nature of RESs. In this paper, dynamic transformer rating (DTR) as a smart-grid technology is coordinated with dynamic distribution network reconfiguration (DDNR) to minimize photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy curtailment. The thermal model of the transformer and all network constraints are considered within an optimization model. The basic problem is a mixed-integer-nonlinear-programming (MINLP) model with non-convex nature. The model is reformulated as a mixed-integer quadratic-constrained programming (MIQCP) to achieve a convex model providing global optimum solution. Several experiments are simulated in the GAMS environment on the IEEE 33-node grid to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. The results show that DTR enables maximizing renewable energies scheduling without loss of life (LOL) of the transformer while satisfying all the problem constraints. With the proposed model, the scheduling of solar and wind energies scheduling is increased by 8.22%, while energy loss is reduced by 21%."

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading global health burden, with carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) recognized as a sensitive, non-invasive biomarker for early atherosclerosis and future cardiovascular risk. Although ultrasound imaging is the standard method for measuring cIMT, its accessibility may be limited in large-scale populations with intensive screening demands or in low-resource settings, posing a significant challenge for stroke survivors who have a high need for CVD assessment. While existing cIMT prediction models based solely on tabular data have been proposed to bypass the need for strong reliance on image-derived features, they typically frame the task as a binary classification problem, indicating only the presence or absence of vascular risk, thereby failing to effectively capture its actual severity. In contrast, this work proposes a prognostic learning model to effectively estimate cIMT, enabling precise quantification of atherosclerosis severity without relying on imaging data. By constructing a patient similarity graph relying on demographic and clinical-derived features to (i) bypass the need for revealing the actual clinical measurements, promoting privacy, and (ii) to explicitly account for patient’s interdependencies, this work introduces a graph-guided self-supervised learning (Self-SL) framework to learn informative representations for the cIMT prediction task. These learned representations encode key local and global graph information that can readily assist the downstream task requiring only a minimal amount of labeled data. Applied to the UK Biobank cohort, the model outperforms conventional learning models, achieving up to 93.22% average MSE reduction, underscoring graph similarity strength in capturing latent clinical patterns."

    "abstract": "Actor-critic (AC) algorithms are model-free deep reinforcement learning techniques that have consistently demonstrated effectiveness across various domains. Enhancing exploration (action entropy) and exploitation (expected return) through more efficient sample utilization is pivotal to their success. A key strategy for a learning algorithm is to intelligently navigate the environment’s state space, prioritizing the exploration of rarely visited states over frequently encountered ones. However, conventional approaches rarely quantify a novel state’s utility for policy learning, which can lead to inefficient exploration. To address this, we propose an innovative approach to bolster exploration by employing an intrinsic reward based on a state’s novelty and the potential benefits of exploring that state, which we term plausible novelty. Our method seamlessly integrates with off-policy AC algorithms. By incentivizing the exploration of plausibly novel states, AC algorithms can achieve substantial improvements in sample efficiency and overall training performance. Empirical results demonstrate 19% improvement in training return and 30% reduction in standard deviation, averaged across comparisons of three benchmark algorithm pairs in five different environments."

Specifically, we provide a new insight for the OOD detection task from a hypothesis testing perspective and propose a novel generalized Benjamini Hochberg (g-BH) procedure to solve the testing problem. Teoretically, the g-BH procedure controls false discovery rate (FDR) under pre-specified level without the consideration of dependence for the p-values. Furthermore, we derive an upper bound and a lower bound of the expectation of false positive rate (FPR) for the g-BH procedure based on the tailed generalized Gaussian distribution family, indicating that the FPR of g-BH procedure converges to zero in probability. Finally, the extensive experimental results verify the superiority of g-BH procedure over the traditional threshold-based decision rule on several generalized OOD detection benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Accurate real-time Quantitative Precipitation Estimation (QPE) is essential for rain-dependent sectors such as agriculture, hydrology, and emergency management. Yet it remains a significant challenge due to the complex spatiotemporal variability of precipitation. Precipitation radar observations provide high-resolution spatiotemporal data but often suffer from limitations such as beam elevation and spreading, or various empirical Z-R relationships, leading to biases in surface rainfall estimation. Integrating a precipitation radar with rain gauge data improves accuracy but introduces additional biases, mostly due to interpolation assumptions. This study introduces RadarGaugeNet, a novel deep-learning model designed to generate continuous, high-resolution, real-time QPEs by leveraging radar data supervised solely by real-time rain gauge observations. RadarGaugeNet employs an encoder-decoder architecture with a mechanism that learns spatially varying radar error patterns without imposing assumptions about rainfall distribution or geographic factors. Trained and validated on a decade of rainfall data from Israel, RadarGaugeNet significantly improves precision, recall, and root mean squared error (RMSE) across diverse climatic and topographical regions, with greater improvement in remote regions where radar coverage is limited. RadarGaugeNet effectively corrects radar biases, avoids interpolation artifacts, and captures terrain-induced precipitation patterns without explicit orographic input. These advancements highlight RadarGaugeNet’s potential for scalable, accurate QPE in complex environments, addressing critical gaps in operational meteorology."

Experimental results show that the system can efficiently generate coherent deceptive jamming signals and supports multiple modulation types such as amplitude, phase, frequency-mixed, and cyclic modulation, significantly enhancing the complexity of jamming waveforms. Compared to discrete systems, the integrated design not only markedly reduces the system’s size, weight, and power (SWaP) consumption but also improves stability and reliability by minimizing fiber interconnections between discrete components. This study provides a feasible technical pathway for developing high-performance, miniaturized electronic warfare systems."

    "abstract": "Automated test generation is one of the most critical topics in software testing, with numerous challenges due to the need for deep code understanding and the creation of meaningful assertions. Traditional approaches often generate low-quality and difficult-to-read tests that lack real code understanding and rely on statistical and dynamic analysis. With the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), new opportunities emerge for generating unit tests that prioritize readability and context understanding. In this paper, we introduce MAGISTER, a multiagent framework for LLM-based unit test generation, where each agent (Analyzer Agent, Test Generation Agent, Executor Agent, and Refiner Agent) specializes in a specific role within the framework workflow, which involves analyzing the codebase to identify testable units and generating test code with feedbackdriven refinement. We evaluated MAGISTER on five open-source Python projects, demonstrating a significant improvement in code coverage for modular codebases compared to the original userwritten tests. However, it still has limitations when handling large and complex projects requiring domain-specific knowledge. Our results demonstrate the promising potential of LLM-driven and agent-based architectures in advancing test automation while highlighting directions for future improvement."

    "abstract": "The majority of conventional recommender systems are based on superficial similarities, explicit user profiles or ratings, and fail to model the underlying structure of user-item relationships. In this paper, we illustrate how Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a more natural and principled way to represent such relationships by exploiting the intrinsic graph structure of recommendation data. We compare three paradigms on the MovieLens 100k dataset: Matrix Factorization (MF), memory-based Collaborative Filtering (CF), and a GNN model. Both users and items are nodes in a bipartite graph in our model. Through the use of SAGEConv layers, the GNN incorporates contextual information from the neighborhood of a node in order to produce more expressive and structure-aware embeddings. Ratings of users are output in a regression task by a multilayer perceptron. Our results show that the GNN model outperforms MF and CF across all splits with RMSE below 1.0. Our study shows the value of using graph structure as an inductive bias and charts a way to recommender system design, away from surface similarity and toward relational, deeper knowledge."

The system is validated through simulations of a squat-like trajectory in a physics-based Gazebo environment, using the REEM-C humanoid robot model. Results show that the proposed RHONNIOC scheme can achieve effective joint trajectory tracking without an explicitly known model, suggesting its potential for model-free control strategies in robotic systems."

The approach presented in this paper switches the BES into an independent grid-forming mode to maintain voltage and frequency without any control changes, and adds a secondary pre-synchronization loop for smooth WG reconnection. Simulations demonstrate seamless transitions of the WG."

IEEE Std. 1547-2018 suggests that distributed energy resources should provide grid services. On the other hand, IBR-driven dynamic events like sub-synchronous oscillations (SSOs) have been reported. These trends require improved modeling capabilities to capture the interactions among transmission and distribution (T&D) systems, IBRs, and conventional resources. This paper presents a co-simulation model integrating PSS/E, OpenDSS, and PSCAD to analyze IBR impacts on the stability of T&D systems. A key challenge is ensuring interoperability among different simulators (interfacing and data flow) while maintaining accuracy. We evaluate two cases: 1) IBR fault ride-through capability during a generation trip contingency and 2) IBR-induced SSOs. This modeling capability enables grid planners and operators assess system reliability, optimize IBR integration, and develop effective mitigation strategies for power systems.

A dedicated top-layer passivation opening enables vertical photodiode deposition and integration with the underlying CMOS circuitry, achieving a fill factor (FF) of about 43% without costly 3D stacking processes. Simulation results of the readout circuit demonstrate efficient avalanche quenching, high-speed operation, and low power consumption. The results indicate a minimum dead time of 1.2 ns and a full voltage swing from 0 V to 3.3 V, validating the design for high-performance SPAD imaging. A 32×32 array has been implemented in a standard 180 nm CMOS process with provisions for low-cost SPAD integration via plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). This hybrid strategy has the potential to lower fabrication cost and broaden the applicability of SPAD-based imaging systems."

To the best of our knowledge, no TFS pixels based on thermal sensors have been demonstrated, while TFS pixels have been explored in the visible spectrum using photodiodes. In this work, the microbolometer is modeled as a temperature-dependent resistor whose voltage is compared against a reference ramp. The crossing time, which varies with temperature, is captured as a digital spike using a C-element and converted to a digital signal via a Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC). This temporally encoded scheme enables efficient, event-driven readout and naturally suppresses spatial redundancy, as pixels responding to similar IR radiation spike simultaneously. To validate this approach, a proof-of-concept (PoC) testchip was designed in 130nm CMOS, integrating a single TFS pixel, a 3×3 TFS pixel array, a ramp voltage generator, and a bias current source. The readout circuitry, including the TDC and control logic, will be implemented on an FPGA to support experimentation with both global and rolling shutter strategies. This work opens a new path toward low-power, event-based IR sensors and neuromorphic thermal imaging systems."

    "abstract": "Voltage stability is emerging as a critical challenge in modern power systems, driven by the increasing integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) and the growing prevalence of large, dynamic loads. This paper presents a real-time, multi-interval Optimal Power Flow (OPF) framework that enhances voltage stability through the incorporation of a convex voltage stability constraint, derived from the minimum singular value of the power flow Jacobian matrix. The objective is to minimize operational costs while maintaining sufficient voltage security across the network. The proposed formulation employs nonlinear AC power flow equations to accurately capture system behavior and constraints. In addition to conventional grid components, the model integrates various IBRs, including renewable energy sources, aggregated Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs). A key innovation lies in the convex reformulation of the voltage stability constraint, which significantly improves computational tractability and enables efficient real-time implementation. The framework is validated on a modified IEEE 24-bus system designed to emulate real-world voltage stability challenges, inspired by operational conditions reported by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method substantially enhances voltage stability and reduces operational costs, confirming its effectiveness and practical applicability in real-world power system operations."

However, the large volume of data generated by sensor nodes often leads to redundancy, noise, and energy inefficiency. To address these challenges, data fusion techniques have been increasingly enhanced by Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve data quality, reduce communication overhead, and enable intelligent decisionmaking. This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of AI-based data fusion methods in WSNs published between 2015 and 2025. Using well-defined search strategies and inclusion/exclusion criteria across major digital libraries (IEEE Xplore, Scopus, web of science and Science Direct), 33 relevant studies were selected and analyzed. The review categorizes existing approaches based on the type of AI techniques used (e.g., machine learning, deep learning, hybrid methods), the fusion levels (sensor, node, gateway), and their application domains. Furthermore, we identify common challenges such as energy constraints, scalability, real-time processing, and model interpretability.

This study aims to examine public readiness to adopt OceanGuardian, a sustainable e-commerce platform for marine conservation products, by integrating behavioral, technological, and environmental perspectives. Using a modified Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) framework, survey data from 600 respondents were analyzed with machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and XGBoost, to identify key determinants of consumer intention and use behavior. Results indicate that social influence, performance expectancy, affordability, and habit formation significantly predict adoption, with Support Vector Machines achieving the highest predictive accuracy (92.5%). The findings highlight the potential of artificial intelligence to enhance consumer behavior analysis while recognizing challenges such as economic barriers and consumer skepticism.

Polynomial multiplication is one of the most critical operations in HQC. Due to side-channel security concerns, the previously-used sparse-dense method was recently replaced by classical dense-dense multiplication implemented using Karatsuba’s algorithm. This change has made polynomial multiplication the primary performance bottleneck, accounting for approximately 95% of the total execution time. This paper presents an alternative polynomial multiplication technique for HQC: the Frobenius Additive Fast Fourier Transform (FAFFT), which provides significant algorithmic-level performance improvements. We also present ANDROMEDA, the first state-of-the-art hardware implementation of FAFFT, and evaluate its performance impact by integrating our solution in a resourceconstrained RISC-V-based System-on-Chip scenario. Experimental results show that our solution improves HQC performance by approximately $9.64 \\times$ and $19.22 \\times$ across its security levels, making HQC more practical for real-world deployment."

    "abstract": "The estimation of Time-of-Flight (ToF) in high frame rate ToF sensors for Light-Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) applications requires a Time-to-Digital (TDC) at the pixel level. Seeking to improve the pixel fill factor, the most suitable approach to implement the fine conversion is by employing a multi-phase Voltage-Controlled Ring-Oscillator (VCRO). Moreover, high oscillation frequency is required to enhance the time resolution. This can be achieved by standard VCRO architecture, merely downscaling the technology node. However, this is not a solution for the monolithic ToF-LiDAR sensors, as the single-photon avalanche-diode photodetectors do not have the best noise and sensitivity performance. In this paper, the design and analysis of an 8-phase current starved ring oscillator with feed-forward coupling for high-frequency applications is discussed along with the measurement results. The VCRO is implemented in 180nm CMOS technology. The proposed topology can achieve the highest measured oscillation frequency of 5.12 GHz with 25% of tuning range capability with 8-phase outputs."

In this context, this work develops the co-simulation of transmission, distribution, and DERs to study the impact of P (f) droop setting parameters of SIs on the primary frequency response of the bulk power grid. The case studies show that the inclusion of SIs with P (f) droop can help enhance the primary frequency response. Moreover, the case studies also show that the choice of P (f) droop parameters (e.g., slope, dead-band) impact the primary frequency response of the bulk power grid, and proper selection of the droop setting parameters can aid in better primary frequency response of the bulk power grid."

However, these signals frequently suffer from missing data due to electrode displacement and wireless transmission failures, compromising brain-computer interface reliability. Traditional signal completion methods fail to capture complex spatiotemporal dynamics, while existing tensor completion approaches require offline processing and cannot handle 2D EEG streams. We propose a sliding-window EEG completion framework integrating Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and High Accuracy Low Rank Tensor Completion (HaLRTC). The method transforms streaming 2D EEG data into 3D tensors through VMD decomposition, enabling online tensor completion across spatial, temporal, and spectral domains. Experimental evaluation demonstrates 13-54% RMSE reduction and SNR values of 4.3-7.5 dB compared to conventional methods. This advancement enables practical tensor completion for neural signal processing, addressing critical barriers to EEG system reliability."

Optimizing essential parameters, such as batch size and nearest neighbor selection in sampling-based methods, can enhance performance in the planning process.

Inspired by the method of the deep fuzzy neural networks, this work introduces Learning-based Informed Trees (LIT*), a samplingbased deep fuzzy learning-based planner that dynamically adjusts batch size and nearest neighbor parameters to obstacle distributions in the configuration spaces. By encoding both global and local ratios via valid and invalid states, LIT* differentiates between obstacle-sparse and obstacle-dense regions, leading to lower-cost paths and reduced computation time. Experimental results in high-dimensional spaces demonstrate that LIT* achieves faster convergence and improved solution quality. It outperforms state-of-the-art single-query, samplingbased planners in environments ranging from <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbb{R}^{8}$</tex> to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbb{R}^{14}$</tex> and is successfully validated on a dual-arm robot manipulation task.

    "abstract": "With the growing concern over water safety, especially in unregulated open water environments, real-time perception of environmental changes has become crucial for accident prevention and emergency response. However, due to complex backgrounds, various interferences, and the prevalence of small-scale and medium-scale targets, traditional object detection methods often struggle to meet the demands for both accuracy and real-time performance. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight and enhanced object detection algorithm, CWMYOLO, integrating CBAM, WTC3k2, and MWPANet modules, based on the YOLOv8 framework. Specifically, the original C2f module is replaced with WTC3k2, a lightweight module combining WTConv and C3k2, to improve feature extraction efficiency while reducing model parameters and computational overhead. To enhance the detection of small objects in open water, the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) is introduced to strengthen the model’s focus on critical regions. Additionally, the Path Aggregation Network (PANet) is upgraded to a Multilevel Weighted Path Aggregation Network (MWPANet) to achieve better multi-scale feature fusion and selection. Experimental results show that the proposed model improves mAP@50 by $1.3 \\%$, and the model parameters and FLOP/s are reduced by $5.00 \\%$ and $7.41 \\%$. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of CWM-YOLO in achieving accurate and efficient object detection in complex open water environments."

    "abstract": "In the context of the deep integration of artificial intelligence and wireless communications, semantic communication has attracted much attention as an emerging paradigm. However, it is difficult for traditional semantic systems to balance semantic redundancy and distortion under a dynamic channel environment. To this end, this paper proposes a robust semantic communication scheme based on channel adaptive coding (CA-SC). The CA-SC model adaptively modifies the conveyed semantic features by combining following two essential modules: 1) semantic metric strategy, which combines an attention mechanism and feature energy to quantify the importance of semantic features; 2) differentiable semantic feature selection, which selects key semantic information for transmission based on channel quality and semantic importance. This channel adaptation mechanism allows the system to maintain high semantic fidelity by focusing on core information under poor channel conditions while maximizing efficiency under good conditions. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can enhance the similarity of semantic recovery. It also shows that the CA-SC model effectively extracts and transmits semantic features under poor channel circumstances."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for identifying damage in bridge structures by combining frequency-domain analysis with hypothesis testing. Vibration signals are continuously collected through a strategically deployed sensor network on the bridge. The method first transforms the vibration signals into the frequency domain, extracting characteristic frequencies from both the healthy and monitored states. The paired-sample t-test is then applied to determine whether the frequency changes are statistically significant, thereby identifying potential damage in the structure. This approach integrates the sensitivity of frequency characteristics with statistical objectivity, allowing for efficient damage detection without relying on complex modal analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs effectively across a variety of damage scenarios, showing robustness and strong practical applicability. It is particularly suitable for long-term monitoring, periodic evaluation, and rapid post-event screening of bridge structures. Additionally, this method can be applied to stiffness-sensitive structures such as railway bridges, urban overpasses and light rail tracks, offering a quantitative assessment of their condition to ensure operational safety and stability."

While grid-following (GFL) inverters dominate wind and solar generation, grid-forming (GFM) inverters enhance frequency support in low-inertia conditions. This paper analyzes the frequency response of SG, GFL, and GFM units in both time and frequency domains, focusing on fast frequency response (FFR) stages: inertial (IFR) and primary (PFR). Although Type-4 wind turbines and PVs lack mechanical inertia, frequency resilience can be improved by replacing GFL control with GFM and integrating GFM-based short- or long-duration energy storage using virtual synchronous machine (VSM) control. EMT simulations validate these strategies across various weak grid scenarios, underscoring the value of partial GFM integration in stabilizing frequency after major disturbances."

This paper focuses on the study and development of a solution to simplify the interaction with machine-level privileged counters and registers, considering two essential non-functional requirements (NFRs): low-overhead access to performance metrics and low memory API usage. The provided solution allows developers to retrieve and analyse performance data directly from user-level space with a simplified interface, while providing feedback for application optimization, isolation, and improved system reliability.

Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) datasets from multiple sources were compiled into an open-access database. Four established curve-fitting methods-MA, MAM, M3P, and LM-were then used to estimate the Cole model parameters. These estimates served as seed values for a fractional-order control system implemented in MATLAB using the Ninteger toolbox. Specifically, a first-generation CRONE approximation enabled dynamic adjustment of the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\tau$</tex> value, based on the frequency response error between model and experimental data. The standard error of estimation (SEE), calculated according to Ayllón et al., was used to evaluate the performance of each method before and after control application. Results show that the fractional-order control approach consistently improves the accuracy of all four methods across three different measurement devices. Although the proposed method currently relies on seed values from conventional algorithms, it demonstrates a promising foundation for future strategies capable of estimating Cole parameters directly from EIS data.

    "abstract": "Existing ICS honeypots suffer from three critical shortcomings: they fail to preserve protocol-state fidelity, accurately emulate controller identities, or reproduce realistic control-business workflows. Consequently, sophisticated adversaries can easily detect and bypass them. To address these gaps, we introduce a multi-layered framework called ICSTrap. At the protocol level, ICSTrap incorporates clean-room state machines to enhance interactivity, while genuine industrial network traffic is replayed to lure attackers into realistic exchange patterns. By applying fuzzing techniques to many Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) models, ICSTrap harvests authentic identity data and then uses these identities to masquerade its protocol honeypots as real devices or to deploy PLC-specific traps. Beyond protocol emulation, ICSTrap recreates three enterprise-scale scenarios—power-grid dispatch, petrochemical control, and gaspipeline operations—by integrating conventional web honeypots with live control flows. In an 11-month, global deployment of 51 honeypots, ICSTrap recorded 2,259,265 connection attempts from 1,365 unique IP addresses. To extract high-threat events from this dataset, we developed an IP reputation scoring method that identified the top ten malicious sources, a tool-and-payload detection technique that revealed the five most commonly used probing frameworks, and a threat organization attribution approach that uncovered the five leading attacker groups."

    "abstract": "Efficient AC–DC interfaces are essential for low-power energy harvesters to power intracardiac leadless pacemakers (ICLPs) reliably. For the front-end circuitry, selecting a diode that minimizes both conduction and leakage losses under specified operating conditions is challenging, as the forward voltage drop and reverse leakage current cannot be simultaneously reduced due to the device’s inherent physics. This brief presents a machine learning framework that predicts the DC output of diode-based AC-DC interfaces directly from specific voltage-current (V-I) characteristic points of the diodes and descriptive features of the excitation waveform. A physics-informed surrogate model is trained on SPICE-simulated data of rectifiers driven by experimentally captured cardiac harvester waveforms. Hardware validation with printed-circuit rectifiers powered by the same harvester source exhibits an average error of 0.03 V between prediction and measurement, matching the performance observed on the synthetic set and demonstrating robust generalization to real-world applications. This data-driven approach offers an instant, datasheet-only diode screening without circuit-level evaluation and can be integrated into automated multi-objective optimization flows for the design of low-power energy harvester AC–DC interfaces."

In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a real-time 38.4-Gbit/s CO-OFDM transmitter enabled by fully-parallel Reed-Solomon (RS) coding and a channel-independent Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT) precoding scheme. The results indicate that WHT precoding reduces the PAPR by approximately 1 dB and can effectively equalize subcarrier SNR after transmission over 20 km of standard single-mode fiber.

    "abstract": "In dynamic millimeter-wave (mmWave) environments, maintaining beam alignment between access point (AP) and user equipments (UEs) is essential for delivering high spectral efficiency (SE) links. However, dynamic environments with temporary blockages necessitate frequent beam training, which causes high overhead and possibly outdated channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, severe signal degradation due to blockages, may trigger channel re-estimation prematurely, even when meaningful updates are unlikely. Our goal is to maximize the network sum-SE and avoid unnecessary channel estimation overhead. Furthermore, the system should promptly restore the communication link following a blockage event. To this end, we propose a joint curriculum learning (CL)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and event-triggered channel re-estimation to design hybrid beamforming at the AP and UEs. The agent learns analog radio-frequency (RF) beamforming policies through a structured curriculum, which consists of channel stages, introduced progressively with increasing complexity. Meanwhile, the digital baseband (BB) beamformers are determined according to well-established formulas. We utilize prioritized experience replay (PER) to enhance DRL performance. This is because environmental stage transitions, initiated by the curriculum, cause high temporal-difference (TD) errors that PER effectively prioritizes. To reduce overhead, channel re-estimation is only executed when necessary, forcing the agent to learn robust beamforming policies under potentially outdated CSI. Despite leveraging rare CSI updates, our proposed method rapidly recovers sum-SE following a blockage event, maintaining the same empirical mean as before. In contrast, state-of-the-art learning-based baselines experience up to 29% sum-SE degradation. Moreover, the sum-SE cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the proposed method substantially outperforms the well-established manifold optimization (MO) hybrid beamforming and demonstrates performance comparable to the fully-digital solution."

While data-driven methods for affordance estimation are common, they often face challenges with data requirements and generalization in surgical scenarios. To address these challenges, a novel framework is proposed that combines a deformation model-based shape controller with an analytical affordance estimation approach for multi-contact scenarios by employing a manipulability metric. The method leverages the deformation Jacobian matrix derived from a linearized deformation model to evaluate the manipulability of candidate multi-contact points, providing a robust and data-efficient solution. For tissue manipulation, a differentiable deformation model is employed to efficiently compute forward and backward deformation processes in real-time. Point-based visual features are constructed to represent and track the tissue deformation, enabling precise control through visual feedback. The proposed framework has been validated through simulations and physical experiments. These results demonstrate the real-time (∼ 60Hz) ability to achieve targeted configuration with high accuracy (< 1mm RMSE for each marker position) and a strong correlation (near-zero p-value) between the predicted affordance and the observed manipulation efficiency, confirming the effectiveness of our approach in soft tissue manipulation and affordance estimation."

    "abstract": "Robotic ultrasound imaging systems primarily focus on enhancing automation in grayscale image acquisition but lack essential functional information, which restricts their clinical effectiveness and efficiency. In this regard, we propose a novel robotic ultrasound system capable of automatically screening and anomaly localization using quasi-static elastography (QE). For continuous screening, a compliant force control strategy is devised to manage the complex probe operations required for elasticity data acquisition. This involves the integration of adaptive out-of-plane posture control and in-plane palpation motion control. For anomaly localization, tissue strains are analyzed using multi-source motion data. We introduce an unsupervised tissue displacement estimation method, complemented by a strain estimator with multi-frame fusion for robust strain estimation. A 3D strain map is reconstructed to enable closed-loop control for automated robotic localization. The system has been validated through extensive experiments on two realistic phantoms and tested on human subjects. Results demonstrate that our system can perform robotic QE-based screening across subjects with varying surface conditions and lesion depths, showing improved efficiency and adaptability compared to existing systems. It achieves satisfactory accuracy in strain-based anomaly localization, with a detection rate of 0.77 and an average localization error of 1.01±0.47 mm for the abdominal phantom, and 0.73 and 3.44±0.84 mm for the more challenging thyroid phantom. By identifying and localizing suspicious anomalies in 3D space, the proposed system shows promise in providing preliminary dia"

    "abstract": "With the exponential growth of transmission traffic in mobile communication systems and the continuous increase in the number of base stations (BSs), the energy consumption of BSs in cellular networks inevitably increases. Integrating renewable energy into BSs has become an important approach to reducing the carbon emissions in cellular networks and achieving green communications. However, a key challenge lies in uniformly characterizing and scheduling both the renewable energy and traffic to optimize the carbon emissions in renewable-energy cellular networks. For the first time, our work introduces the concept of exergy loss to characterize the coupling relationship between information and energy, describing the adaptation-optimization problem caused by source-load uncertainty in renewable-energy-powered cellular networks. Based on the exergy-balance theory, we establish an exergy-loss model for renewable-energy-powered cellular networks and design a minimum-exergy-loss algorithm to optimize the carbon emissions. Simulation results show that the proposed minimum-exergy-loss optimization algorithm can reduce the grid's energy consumption by up to 65.92% and decrease the system's carbon emissions by up to 10.05%."

    "abstract": "To mitigate the progressive cognitive decline associated with recurrent seizures in epilepsy patients, several electroencephalogram (EEG)-based epilepsy prediction methods have been proposed with varying degrees of success. However, these methods continue to grapple with challenges such as multi-scale feature extraction and fusion, spatiotemporal feature decoupling, and enhancing the model’s robustness. To address these issues, we introduce EPNet, an EEG-based epilepsy prediction model. EPNet integrates multiscale convolution, the Multiscale Feature Fusion (MSFF) module and the Spatially Enhanced Squeeze-and-Excitation Attention (SESA) module through two-stage feature extraction process to effectively capture crucial spatio-temporal features. During the classification stage, the Cross-Covariance Transformer (XCiT) module is employed for global information fusion, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy. We evaluated EPNet using scalp EEG data from 13 patients in the CHB-MIT dataset for subject-independent seizure prediction. EPNet achieved impressive results, with a sensitivity of 98.19%, specificity of 94.35%, and accuracy of 96.31%. These results surpass the performance of most relevant models, demonstrating EPNet’s efficacy in epilepsy prediction."

    "abstract": "Creatinine, a waste product derived from protein and muscle metabolism, is a significant biomarker of kidney related diseases, with normal clinical values ranging in micromolar concentrations. The limitations of traditional kidney diagnostic modalities include the usage of more reagents, larger interference, and the requirement of expertise for diagnosis and interpretation. Recently, Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) has been explored for onsite detection of biomolecules with minimal sample preparation, achieving single molecule sensitivity. However, defining distinct Raman characteristic peaks from the complex structure of individual biomolecules and enhancing the weak Raman signal for single molecule detection are challenging. Therefore, this study focuses on the automated detection of creatinine using Raman spectral peaks obtained from a graphene oxide gold nanocomposite (GOAu) coated SERS substrate. The GOAu substrate enhances the weak Raman signal, allowing for the identification of inherent peaks of creatinine at 604, 678, 836, and 904 cm⁻¹. In addition, a deep learning feedforward neural network, utilizing ReLU activation, was additionally employed to enable the classification and detection of ultra-low creatinine concentrations with a LoD of 1 pM, where characteristic Raman peaks are not clearly distinct due to low signal-to-noise, and achieved an accuracy of 98%. This promotes the proposed sensor ultra-sensitive detection of creatinine, offering early diagnosis of kidney related diseases."

We introduce a robust adaptation module that provides a mechanism for identifying and reacting to both in-distribution and out-of-distribution environment dynamics, along with a joint training pipeline that combines the goals of in-distribution adaptation and out-of-distribution robustness. Our algorithm GRAM achieves strong generalization performance across in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios upon deployment, which we demonstrate through extensive simulation and hardware locomotion experiments on a quadruped robot."

Existing models tend to overlook this dynamic lag relationship. To address these challenges, this study proposes a power load forecasting model that integrates three key mechanisms: a dynamic forward lag mechanism, a turning point attention mechanism, and a temporal and channel hybrid mechanism. These components collectively enable the forecasting model to adaptively align meteorological lags, focus on abrupt load transitions, and capture both global temporal dependencies and local feature interactions, thereby enhancing its ability to model complex load behaviors and improve prediction accuracy. Seven experiments were conducted using load data from Singapore and Calgary, Canada, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Numerical results show that the proposed method achieves higher forecasting accuracy compared to existing load forecasting approaches."

APDs with an ultra-shallow bevel edge termination (2.5°) exhibit superior ruggedness, withstanding a static avalanche current density of 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> A/cm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> at room temperature and accelerated avalanche stress at 175 °C. In contrast, inherent instabilities are revealed in APDs with a conventional-shallow (12°) bevel edge. Degradation modes observed under stress included avalanche current increase after room-temperature stress and destructive breakdown at high temperature. The degradation mechanism is attributed to the trap-assisted charge dynamics at the mesa sidewall, a process driven by the high local electric field at the mesa sidewall. This degradation is effectively mitigated by the ultra-shallow 2.5°-bevel structure, which significantly reduces the sidewall electric field. The resulting high stability establishes a new benchmark for GaN APD reliability."

    "abstract": "This letter presents a novel density-based control framework for shape formation in swarm robotic systems, operating exclusively on local perception without requiring communication or identity recognition among robots and targets. Inspired by Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), each robot estimates a local spatial density using kernel functions and regulates its motion based on the gradient of a constructed target density field. Unlike existing methods that depend on global coordination or explicit target assignments, the proposed approach enables fully distributed shape formation through local density regulation alone. By adjusting the reference density, the system supports autonomous scaling in both the number of robots and the geometric size of the target shape, seamlessly transitioning among shape-surrounding, double-layer contour, and boundary-conformal formations. A composite control law integrates density-driven forces, repulsive interactions for collision avoidance, and damping for dynamic stability. The effectiveness and robustness of the method are validated through extensive simulations and physical experiments with 50 robots under a motion capture laboratory setup. Results demonstrate the scalability, resilience, and practicality of the approach for decentralized swarm shape formation."

An active switched inductor (ASL) network is integrated into the front-end section of a modified SEPIC converter, facilitating a wide voltage conversion ratio while reducing voltage stress on the major switches. The proposed converter offers multifunctional capabilities, enabling seamless integration with photovoltaic (PV) systems, battery storage, and DC grids. The battery can be charged either from the PV system or directly from the DC grid, enhancing system flexibility. Furthermore, synchronous rectification is implemented using complementary switching to improve conversion efficiency. The steady-state analysis is presented for both continuous conduction mode (CCM) and discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). A dynamic model of the converter is developed, and its performance is validated under both open-loop and closed-loop conditions using SiC MOSFETs. Experimental results verify the enhanced performance and practicality of the proposed converter for energy storage systems in DC grids, electric vehicles (EVs), and other industrial power conversion applications."

    "abstract": "During traditional open surgery for liver tumor resection, surgical failures often occur because surgical tools touch the tumor or deviate from the surgical path. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an intelligent early warning system for tumor resection based on surgical navigation. Firstly, to address the issue of collisions between surgical tools and tumors, a safe area for surgical tools to cut tumors is established. A mechanism for early warning of collisions between surgical tools and tumors has been constructed. Secondly, the characteristics of surgical paths of different shapes are analyzed. A mathematical calculation model for the distance of surgical tools deviating from surgical paths of different shapes during tumor resection is proposed. Then, a warning model for the deviation of surgical tools from the surgical path is constructed. Finally, experiments are designed to verify the relevant performance of the early warning system proposed in this paper. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the early warning system proposed in this paper is about 95%, and the scope of tumor resection is controlled within 4 mm."

A Taguchi-based grey relational analysis is utilised to identify the optimal nanoparticle-surfactant concentration based on various parameters. The identified optimal nanofluid is further validated using the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory to confirm the stable suspension phenomenon. The DLVO-based total interaction potential energy indicated a higher potential barrier at the optimized concentration of 50 mg/L AlN and 1 mg/L CTAB, supporting enhanced nanofluid stability. The degradation behaviour of nano fluid studied under standard impulse current (standard 8/20μs waveform) was studied. Simultaneously, optical emission spectroscopy (OES) was employed during impulse application to capture real-time spectral changes. The results demonstrate that the nanofluid exhibits enhanced suspension stability, reduced acidity and improved resistance to electrical degradation. The negative polarity impulses induce a more pronounced destabilizing effect compared to positive impulses, emphasizing the asymmetric impact of surge conditions on nanofluid performance. This work highlights the critical role of nanoparticle-surfactant interactions in advancing the reliability of transformer insulating systems."

To overcome this problem, this article develops a novel system based on machine-tactile-sensation (MTS) to detect the microdefect. The MTS-based inspection system uses vision-based tactile sensor to convert the tactile signals into visual image, which can capture the fine geometric morphology of the microdefects. Furthermore, considering the limited resolution of the transformed signal, TouchNet, which integrates a label-guided diversity contrastive learning method with an adaptive receptive field selection module, is introduced for defect recognition, which can leverage prior knowledge to guide hyperspherical clustering and employs Gram regularization to prevent feature degradation. The experimental results on the HUST-Tactile dataset indicate that the proposed method can detect the microdefects as small as 0.01 mm with 97.06% accuracy. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art models by 1.33% and 8.46% on the public NEU-CLS and RSW-C datasets, respectively."

    "abstract": "Recovery in comatose patients after cardiac arrest is uncertain, and in the absence of information supporting the likelihood of functional recovery, premature decisions may be made to withdraw life-sustaining treatment, potentially leading to avoidable death. This work proposes the analysis of RR interval histograms from electrocardiogram recordings during the first days of hospitalization in the intensive care unit from 137 patients. A fitting approach is proposed using three components: one exponential and two Gaussian functions. A subset of patients from the PhysioNet Challenge 2023 database was used to calculate the nine parameters of the proposed model, which were then used as input to a Multilayer Perceptron. Results show that the proposed method associates the RR interval behaviour along the hours with the outcome provided in the database achieving a precision of 0.74, recall of 0.88 and f1-score of 0.80 for the poor class, while getting a precision of 0.78, recall of 0.58 and f1-score of 0.67 for the good class, with an overall specificity of 0.88. These preliminar results suggest that using a larger dataset can improve the performance to predict functional recovery in comatose patients."

This paper presents a Discriminative Dictionary Learning (DDL) model that is boosted with spectral feature extraction using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in order to achieve better appliance-level disaggregation. This algorithm learns representative dictionary atoms, and a discriminative classifier in a sequence of alternating optimisation of sparse codes, dictionary updates, and classifier updates. Two modes are considered, a base time-domain DDL and the suggested time-frequency DDL to supplement input windows with spectral characteristics obtained by FFT. The experiment on the Pecan Street data indicates that the addition of spectral information significantly increases the accuracy, recall, and F1 -scores, especially on appliances with unique frequency patterns, including microwaves and refrigerators, hence proves that spectral features can boost the discriminative ability of dictionary learning to predict NILM."

    "abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive pipeline for enhancing natural language processing systems in Arabic legal and administrative domains by integrating external knowledge sources into language generation models. While such approaches have demonstrated strong performance in highresource languages like English, their extension to Arabic has been limited due to linguistic complexity, lack of curated datasets, and poor document structure. Arabic legal documents often appear in unstructured formats such as scanned multicolumn files, making text extraction and processing particularly challenging. To address these issues, we propose a multi-stage system that includes robust text extraction, semantic segmentation, and retrieval of relevant content prior to language generation. We evaluate several multilingual embedding and generation models on a manually curated dataset of legal examples drawn from a corpus of over 225,000 pages. Our experiments show that a multilingual embedding model trained for semantic similarity outperforms alternatives in both accuracy and efficiency. We also find that a widely available language generation model produces the most reliable answers under limited computational resources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our chosen retrieval infrastructure achieves significantly lower latency compared to alternative systems. These results confirm that it is feasible to deploy knowledge-enhanced language generation systems in Arabic legal domains, even in low-resource settings. This work contributes practical methods and insights for extending language technologies to underrepresented languages and complex document types."

Piecewise linearization and second-order cone relaxation methods are employed to improve the solution efficiency.

At the current moment, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have been promising approaches for prediction, early detection, real-time monitoring, and risk assessment. AI can better predict wildfires, while also identifying closely with its trends, by leveraging sources such as large-scale satellite, meteorological station, and sensor network data sets. Deep learning methodologies could be applied for smoke detection, predicting fire expansion, and supporting the decision-making of emergency responders. These are accomplished with methods such as image processing and time series prediction. Recent AI and ML developments in wildfire management are discussed in this review. It includes new physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for coupling subgrid fire-dynamics and atmosphere-dynamics.

This paper introduces a practical solution: a real-time child abduction detection and alert system that is affordable and privacy-focused. The system relies on several smart agents, each running on a compact Raspberry Pi computer equipped with a camera. These agents use advanced algorithms to continuously watch and understand the interactions between children and adults, right as events happen. If the system detects suspicious behavior or a possible abduction attempt, it sends immediate alerts via SMS, WhatsApp, or automated phone calls using Twilio's communication service. Not only does the approach catch threats with high accuracy and minimal delays, but it also keeps user data safe by processing everything locally on the device. By combining multiple intelligent agents, the system gains a better grasp of context, improving its reliability compared to older, single-model surveillance solutions. In short, this technology gives families and communities a low-cost and easy way to monitor vulnerable children in real time and sound a fast alarm if something goes wrong."

    "abstract": "Effective inventory classification plays a crucial role in optimizing supply chain management, influencing decisions related to stock control, resource allocation, and demand forecasting. Traditional inventory classification methods, such as ABC analysis, have long been the standard but often oversimplify complex decision-making scenarios by focusing on a limited number of criteria. Previous research has attempted to enhance classification accuracy by incorporating multi-criteria decisionmaking (MCDM) methods, but challenges remain when dealing with conflicting factors like cost, lead time, and usage. This paper integrates machine learning models with the TOPSIS MCDM approach to optimize inventory classifications by enhancing the weight assignment and ranking processes. Using a benchmark dataset of 47 inventory items, four configurations were compared: equal weights, lead-time-prioritized weights, and machine learning-based weights derived from Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. The results showed that the lead-time-prioritized TOPSIS achieved complete alignment with the expert-based ZF model, outperforming the other configurations. These findings demonstrate that incorporating domain-relevant weighting can substantially improve classification accuracy and decision-making reliability. The study contributes to the development of adaptive, data-informed Decision Support Systems (DSS) for dynamic, real-world inventory environments."

To study the effectiveness of providing flexibility using HDEVs, this paper proposes a reserve and flexible load scheduling model considering the characteristics of HDEVs. Case studies were performed on the IEEE RTS-96 24-bus system with wind energy and ten HDEV depots, and the impact of managing HDEV charging on system operating costs and wind energy integration were analyzed. Results show that optimally scheduling the charging and discharging of HDEVs can reduce power system operating costs by up to 3.7% and wind curtailment by up to 57%."

Moreover, the rising power demand driven by AI data centers and industrialization has led to more complex transmission and distribution networks, making fault detection and classification more challenging. Traditional machine learning models often depend on manual feature extraction and tend to struggle with nonlinearities and noise. In contrast, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a powerful subset of deep learning, are well-suited for complex feature extraction and have been widely applied in power system protection. This paper provides a comprehensive review of CNN-based approaches for FDC in power systems. It examines various network architectures, methodologies, optimization techniques, and evaluation metrics, and also compares the performance of recent CNN models."

    "abstract": "This paper explores the process of consolidating interconnection queue data from seven Independent System Operators (ISOs), CAISO, SPP, PJM, ERCOT, ISO-NE, NYISO, and MISO, into a comprehensive and unified database for use in power systems research. The goal is to create a single, large-scale dataset that captures all interconnection requests across these ISOs, facilitating in-depth analysis of trends in generation capacity seeking to connect to the U.S. grid. This unified database enables the visualization of the evolving energy mix within these requests, assesses potential impacts on the US transmission network, and supports informed decision making on future investments in the regions governed by these ISOs. In addition to merging these data sources, this paper details the data cleaning and processing steps necessary to ensure the resulting data set is accurate, reliable, and actionable for stakeholders in grid planning, energy policy, and infrastructure development."

    "abstract": "It is well-known that power systems operation always affected by various uncertainties which make the bus voltage a random process that can be characterized by its probability density function (PDF) at any time instant. In this context, this paper presents a novel PDF-based voltage control framework for power systems. By modeling voltage as a stochastic process, we formulate a stochastic differential equationthat captures grid uncertainties. The associated Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation is derived to describe the evolution of the voltage PDF, which enables the formulation of a PDF-shaping control strategy. To simplify the PDF control formulation, a B-spline neural network is introduced for real-time estimation and regulation of the voltage distribution. The proposed PDF control law updates voltage references for energy storage systems and synchronous generators using real-time PDF measurements and feedback signals. The proposed method is validated on a modified Kundur’s two-area system. Simulation results demonstrate that the controller can significantly improve the voltage stability under stochastic conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in modern inverter-rich grids."

This study proposes and critically evaluates a quantum-inspired sliding mode control (Q-SMC) framework to improve classic SMC approaches' robustness, precision, and computational efficiency. The research contains developing comprehensive dynamic models of a six-degree-offreedom articulated robotic arm, followed by an in-depth comparative assessment of classical SMC and the novel Q-SMC methodology. Simulation results highlight the superiority of QSMC in managing the chattering, achieving better trajectory tracking accuracy, and reducing energy consumption by approximately 2.97%. These findings establish Q-SMC as an advantageous advance in control strategies, with significant implications for high-precision and energy-efficient robotic manipulation in involved operational conditions."

    "abstract": "Cryptographic algorithms are indispensable from today’s world and often require high-throughput implementations accelerated by specialized hardware like field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). However, these implementations are vulnerable to passive and active side-channel attacks. This paper presents a clock glitch generator designed to inject precise glitches into a clock signal, enabling an active side-channel attack. The generator uses only FPGA clocking resources to maintain signal integrity. An FPGA-internal calibration method is incorporated to generate consistent glitches, independent of the implementation run and the physical device characteristics. The start and width of the glitches can be set with a step size of 0.53°, equal to 14.8 ps, for a 100 MHz clock. The generator’s architecture allows glitches to be inserted in the positive and negative phase of the clock. This increases the versatility of possible attacks. The clock glitch generator was used to attack both the mixed-mode clock manager (MMCM) and phase-locked loop (PLL) primitives within the 7-Series and Ultrascale+ FPGAs from AMD-Xilinx. Despite the PLL’s ability to filter out clock glitches, an attack scenario was successfully identified that stealthily increased the output frequency of a 7-Series MMCM and PLL by up to 68%."

This paper presents a comparative study of four human-robot interaction modalities: Hand Gesture (HG), Voice Command (VC), Graphical User Interface (GUI) and EEG-based interaction in the framework of a cobot-assisted disassembly setup. The system was first validated in simulation using RoboDK and then deployed in a real environment to assess performance in four representative scenarios: noisy conditions, precision tasks, hands-free operation and emergency intervention. The gesture emerged as the most balanced and robust modality achieving a recognition rate of 95% with a response time of 1.3 seconds and demonstrating great adaptability in all scenarios. The graphical interface offers the highest recognition rate and fastest response time (0.8 s) but requires full visual attention. Voice control performed moderately well while EEG showed the lowest reliability. This study concludes that rather than completely eliminating a single modality each HRI method is valuable when properly integrated and selected according to the specific requirements of the task."

This systematic literature review investigates developments in Arabic text correction from 2015 to 2025, with a particular emphasis on methods leveraging language models and deep learning. The present advancements in Arabic grammatical error correction is represented by the AraBART model. It achieved an F1 score of 92.1 % when evaluated on the QALB-2014 dataset. For grammatical error detection (GED), a Bi-LSTM-based system attained an Fmeasure of 95.19%, while spelling correction systems reached an auto-correction rate of 96 % using a hybrid approach combining edit distance and probabilistic language models. In addition to benchmarking performance, this review highlights key limitations such as data scarcity, the need for high-quality annotated corpora, and the handling of contextually ambiguous errors. Expected outcomes include the identification of research gaps and recommendations for future work, particularly in developing more robust models and richer datasets to advance automatic Arabic text correction."

By optimally scheduling the BE workload, computing demand can be shifted away from peak usage periods while still meeting essential system requirements. Case studies were carried out over 24 hours with 5-minute time intervals on the IEEE 24-bus RTS-96 system, and the results show that the proposed load scheduling model can effectively reduce emissions from the system, regardless of the location of the data center. The model can be used to enhance the flexibility of the modern computing infrastructure, considering its environmental impacts."

However, ultrasound images often have poor quality due to low resolution, low contrast, and speckle noise. This can make it hard to make a correct diagnosis. Recently, artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, has demonstrated remarkable capability to enhance ultrasound images, surpassing traditional methods. This work presents a comprehensive review. It covers the latest deep learning methods developed for ultrasound image enhancement. We classify these techniques according to their main purpose: speckle reduction, super-resolution, and multi-objective enhancement. We assess recent studies in each category, reviewing the strengths, datasets, evaluation metrics, and clinical utility of each technique. The review also highlights current challenges, including limitations in real-time processing and poor application to diverse patient data. Finally, we suggest future steps to successfully integrate DL-enhanced ultrasound imaging into real-world clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Business intelligence went from static reports to real time analytics, while agentic artificial intelligence evolved to autonomous agents able to use call tools. Yet these parallel advancements rarely found a common ground in order to converge: today's business intelligence dashboards still depend on analysts to interpret insights and trigger actions. Also, agentic artificial intelligence flows rarely integrate with enterprise business intelligence pipelines. This paper reviews and attempts to dig into this persistent gap. Building on our proof of concept internet of things decision support framework, we propose results that show that we can build architectures adapted for a business intelligence centric context. Sensor data is streamed via Message Queuing Telemetry Transport, then an agentic layer is implemented with Langchain and local large language models subscribes to the same data, enriches it through retrieval augmented generation for a domain specific vector store, and issues autonomously decisions back into the business intelligence ecosystem. In addition, we highlight the urge to examine if artificial intelligence agents can act like business analysts deciding which plots or visualizations are most appropriate for each use case to maximize insight delivery. Thus, dashboards transition from passive monitors to actionable control panels. The results show that merging advanced business intelligence with agentic artificial intelligence is technically feasible and operationally beneficial, it raises at the same time questions about security, governance, explainability and ethics. This study provides a concrete blueprint for closing the gap between business intelligence and agentic artificial intelligence and it outlines a research agenda for truly autonomous business analytics in industry settings."

An IRIG-B-based synchronization scheme aligns the internal clocks of both platforms, ensuring deterministic operation and reducing numerical instabilities during hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) scenarios. The framework is evaluated on two representative test systems—a simple transmission network and an offshore wind farm connected via HVDC link—subjected to transient conditions. Comparative results demonstrate that precise time synchronization significantly improves numerical stability, minimizes solver step mismatches, and suppresses transient artifacts. The findings confirm that combining the TLM-Aurora interface with IRIG-B time synchronization provides reliable and accurate co-simulation performance for both simple and complex grid configurations, offering a scalable solution for future large-scale distributed real-time simulation and digital twin applications."

    "abstract": "The high number of cancer-related deaths around the world is alarming. Projections indicate that this number will rise significantly by the year 2025. Current treatments are often ineffective and come with unbearable side effects for patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new, effective, and safer cancer therapies. In this search, anticancer peptides have emerged as a promising solution due to their high selectivity, biocompatibility, high tissue penetration, low risk of developing resistance, low toxicity, and low production costs, among other advantages. Recently, multiple natural peptides with anticancer activity have been identified from edible insects. For instance, peptides derived from Periplaneta americana (the American cockroach) have exhibit different mechanisms of action in their anticancer activity. This study proposed a computational protocol that uses bioinformatics and machine learning tools to analyze the genome of this insect, with the aim of identifying novel potential anticancer peptides. The results suggest two short candidate peptides for further experimental testing. Notably, these peptides were not found in the APD, CAMP, and DBAASP databases, suggesting that they may not have been previously tested for any biological activity. Due to their high similarity to known anticancer peptides, it is likely that they could exhibit anticancer activity in different cancer cell lines."

    "abstract": "A persistent \"employability paradox\"—the disconnect between high academic achievement and real-world job readiness—plagues higher education. Universities possess vast student data but often lack the framework to convert this data into the strategic knowledge needed to guide student success. This research addresses this data-to-knowledge gap by applying an Organizational Knowledge Management (OKM) framework. The primary objective is to move beyond simple prediction and construct an interpretable, \"white-box\" knowledge model that anatomizes the hierarchical factors and compensatory pathways leading to successful graduate placement. Following a Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, this study utilizes a public \"Graduate Employability Dataset\" (n=661) within the AI Studio platform. We implement a C4.5 Decision Tree classifier, selected specifically for its high interpretability. The model was trained on an 80% data partition and validated against a 20% hold-out test set to ensure predictive fidelity. The resulting model achieved a high-fidelity accuracy of 96.97% with a robust F1-Score of 90.00% for the positive placement class. More significantly, the qualitative analysis of the \"white-box\" model revealed a clear \"anatomy of success.\" IQ was identified as the root-node \"gateway\" factor. For high-IQ graduates, the model uncovered three distinct and compensatory pathways to placement: high CGPA (Path 1), high Communication_Skills (Path 2), or a high number of Projects_Completed (Path 3). Critically, the model rendered Internship_Experience (as a binary attribute) statistically redundant, suggesting its value is captured by other, more measurable skills. This study successfully transforms a static dataset into a dynamic, actionable knowledge asset. The findings provide a data-driven blueprint for institutional intervention, enabling universities to move from reactive advising to a personalized, predictive strategy. It offers a clear, evidence-based roadmap for students and curriculum designers, demonstrating that multiple, distinct profiles can lead to a successful career outcome."

This study investigates Filipino consumers’ behavioral intention to use an upcycling e-marketplace, highlighting the intersection of sustainability, consumer psychology, and digital platforms. Despite growing interest in circular economy models, adoption drivers in this domain remain underexplored and are rarely modeled with predictive analytics. To address this gap, the study collected data from 500 Filipino participants capturing environmental knowledge and concern, perceived ease of use and usefulness, attitude toward use, perceived behavioral control, subjective norms, user demand, and intention, then analyzed using multiple machine learning algorithms, namely, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine. Among these, the Decision Tree model demonstrated the best balance of predictive accuracy (95%), precision (96%), and recall (91%), suggesting strong classification capability. Analysis of the importance of features revealed that Perceived Usefulness, Attitude Toward Use, and Subjective Norms were the most influential predictors of adoption, outweighing traditional environmental concerns. These findings underscore the importance of designing upcycling platforms that emphasize practical value, user convenience, and social validation. The study concludes that sustainable behavior is more likely when aligned with personal benefits and peer influence, rather than relying solely on environmental appeals."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an approach leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) to address the challenging issue of detecting disturbances in power systems in more accurate manner. The RL agent operates within a Q-learning environment to identify disturbances in dataset from Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), which provide comprehensive feedback including voltage in per-unit, voltage angle, and frequency for each bus, making them highly suitable for RL models. The proposed approach involves designing an environment using OpenAI Gym for effective observation and interaction for the process of training the Q-learning agent on normal PMU data to establish a baseline understanding. The agent is then evaluated on dataset containing disturbances of varying magnitudes to test its detection capabilities. Test results show that the RL agent performs more effectively for distinguishing normal and disturbed states. This advancement highlights the potential of RL application to offer more accurate disturbance detection in electric grid."

The proposed approach integrates a Kalman filter-based state observer and a nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm implemented using the CasADi optimization framework. The observer estimates internal converter states using only DC bus and battery voltage measurements, reducing sensor requirements without compromising control accuracy. Unlike previous works based on LQG/LQI control and linearized models, the proposed MPC formulation uses the full nonlinear averaged model of the converter to achieve improved transient response, and to ensure robustness under a wide range of operating conditions. Simulation results under different voltage conversion modes (buck, boost, and unitary gain) demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method when compared with classical LQG strategies. Moreover, the use of CasADi toolbox enables symbolic modeling and automatic differentiation, facilitating future deployment in real-time embedded platforms."

We focus on reformulations using McCormick envelopes applied to the Second-Order Conic Programming (SOCP) relaxation of ACOPF. Several classes of valid inequalities, including ring cuts, reverse cone envelopes, and arctangent envelopes, are integrated into the relaxation. A combined tightening framework is proposed, beginning with bound tightening via SOCP relaxations, followed by adding valid inequalities and successive refinement of the McCormick envelopes with FBBT. Experimental results show that integrating arctangent envelopes with FBBT yields a tighter and more scalable relaxation. This approach significantly reduces the average SOCP gap from 8.14% to 4.11%, thereby improving the practical performance of convex relaxations for ACOPF."

The fault detection strategy relies on an auxiliary lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) acting on the outputs of the first layer of the monitored CNN as an early exit instrument, and enabling the detection of faults possibly affecting the CNN computations. Specifically, the outcomes of the CNN and the MLP are compared across a sequence of observations (observation window), calculating the level of agreement between them. As a result, an incorrect prediction from a CNN caused by a hardware fault can be identified when the agreement drops below a set threshold. This mechanism was implemented and evaluated using a set of representative CNNs and datasets. The results showed that the system can detect between 78.60% to 97.79% of faults, depending on the CNN and the dataset."

On this domain, the closed-loop trajectories remain robust and safe against uncertainties and disturbances. Furthermore, we design a controller gain that guarantees convergence to the safe sliding domain while avoiding the given unsafe set. The concept is initially developed for first-order sliding mode and is subsequently generalized to an adaptive framework, ensuring that trajectories remain confined to a predefined vicinity of the sliding domain, outside the unsafe region."

Furthermore, we investigate the application of automated search tools—such as MILP, SAT/SMT, and constraint programming (CP)—to optimize linear approximations in modern cryptographic algorithms. By transforming the search for optimal linear characteristics into mathematical constraint problems, these methods address the challenge of manual trail analysis and provide efficient solutions. We summarize current research progress in this area and outline future research directions. Additionally, we examine the integration of LCA with other analytical techniques, including linear fault analysis, integral cryptanalysis, and linear algebraic methods. Finally, we propose a framework for selecting optimal attack strategies based on the structural properties of block ciphers, offering valuable insights for enhancing resistance against linear cryptanalysis. This work not only consolidates existing methodologies but also provides a structured reference for advancing hybrid cryptanalytic approaches."

During across the line motor starts, as well as reduced voltage starting, a sag condition typically occurs as the shaft comes up to full speed. In industrial power systems adjacent loads such as adjustable frequency motor drives may be impacted by this transient disturbance. The situation can be further aggravated when the common bus is fed from a back-up diesel-generator set. Using a real-time controller hardware-in-the-loop simulator this starting condition will be examined. The goal is to determine if the power flow remains in the safe operating area of the diesel-generator set and capture how the adjustable frequency drive’s hardware controller reacts to the disturbance. Multiple starting scenarios are examined including reduced voltage primary reactor starting, reduced voltage solid-state soft-starter starting, and the number of parallel generators to determine how the adjustable frequency drive already operating a motor responds."

This paper presents a data-driven attack model that examines how an adversary can exploit direct load control (DLC) mechanisms to selectively disconnect downstream loads during periods of high solar generation. Such targeted load tripping forces excess PV output to flow back toward the substation transformer, potentially causing power imbalances and transformer overloading. We model both PV output and load demand as multivariate Gaussian distributions to capture their inherent temporal and spatial uncertainties. A probabilistic power imbalance metric is defined to quantify the extent of reverse flow under compromised conditions. To identify the most impactful combinations of load disconnections and timing, we employ a multi-armed bandit approach based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the attack strategy under realistic variability in solar output and demand."

The model processes intra- and peritumoral regions of interest through two parallel CNN branches, merging deep feature maps at various levels of abstraction using switchable fusion blocks. This flexibility enables the identification of an adequate configuration for improved classification performance. Five configurations are tested by incrementally activating the number of fusion blocks. The results indicate that employing a single fusion block, which combines feature maps from the final stages of both branches, is sufficient to achieve high classification accuracy. Specifically, this configuration yields a sensitivity of 0.856, a specificity of 0.906, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.955 for mammography. For breast ultrasound, this configuration achieves a sensitivity of 0.813, a specificity of 0.904, and an AUC of 0.933.

    "abstract": "Energy storage control systems (ESCS) equipped with integrated energy storage platforms (IESPs) serve as vital components in modern microgrids and distributed energy systems. However, these systems also inherit a range of vulnerabilities common to industrial control systems (ICS), rendering them susceptible to cyber threats. This paper investigates the key cybersecurity weaknesses in platforms, including open or misconfigured ports, weak or default credentials, insecure communication protocols, and known software vulnerabilities. Drawing on recent real-world advisories and documented CVEs, we highlight how these flaws may be exploited to compromise operational integrity, cause grid instability, or enable lateral attacks within critical infrastructure networks. The findings underscore the urgency of adopting robust defense-in-depth strategies and secure configurations for proactive vulnerability management of IESPs."

    "abstract": "To address the issues of excessive waypoints and longer path lengths in the traditional Jump Point Search (JPS) algorithm for robot path planning, this paper introduces the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm and proposes an integrated approach, the Integration of Bidirectional Alternating JPS and SA Algorithms (SA-JPS), to ensure global path optimality. The SA-JPS algorithm optimizes the jump point search strategy, refines the path cost function, and incorporates random perturbations to eliminate redundant points and reduce path length. This algorithm utilizes a bidirectional alternating JPS algorithm to rapidly generate an initial collision-free path in a structured grid map, thereby reducing search time through a bidirectional search strategy. The introduction of random perturbations and the annealing strategy from the simulated annealing algorithm helps to minimize redundant points in the path and prevent it from converging to a local optimum. In comparative experiments against the JPS algorithm, the algorithm proposed in this paper reduced the average path length by 10.1% and the average path point count by 67.7% during the path search process. This study validates the feasibility of an improved path planning method that fuses the Bidirectional Alternating JPS and Simulated Annealing algorithms, offering a novel solution for path planning with high smoothness and shorter path lengths."

    "abstract": "Traditional quantitative genetics rely on known pedigrees for estimating polygenic breeding values and variance components. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing, estimation of empirical relationships between individuals have become feasible. The single-step genomic BLUP procedure integrates polygenic and genomic information but requires intricate pedigree connections, leading to computationally demanding matrix operations. Here, we propose DYpREG, a flexible proximal operator multi-objective regularization method. DYpREG is a splitting algorithm that accommodates two distinct loss functions and a regularization function that can be chosen as LASSO, ridge regression (RR) or elastic net (EN). Notably, it incorporates pre-calculated breeding values without the need for extensive relationship matrix computations. Evaluated on two traits with different heritabilities from mice and pig, DYpREG with RR regularizer showed the best predictive performance compared to DYpREG with LASSO and EN regularizers as well as to all methods lacking polygenic information. The mean squared error (MSE) reduction was notable for both mice traits (1.5% and 24.77%) and both pig traits (2.8% and 2.1%). Comparative analyses with Bayesian reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and spike-and-slab (BayesC) regression also revealed consistent improvements. Hence, DYpREG effectively integrates polygenic information, enhancing prediction accuracy in genomic evaluations."

    "abstract": "Sentiment contagion occurs when attitudes toward one topic are influenced by attitudes toward others. Detecting and understanding this phenomenon is essential for analyzing topic evolution and informing social policies. Prior research has developed models to simulate the contagion process through hypothesis testing and has visualized user–topic correlations to aid comprehension. Nevertheless, the vast volume of topics and the complex interrelationships on social media present two key challenges: (1) efficient construction of large-scale sentiment contagion networks, and (2) in-depth explorations of these networks. To address these challenges, we introduce a causality-based framework that efficiently constructs and explains sentiment contagion. We further propose a map-like visualization technique that encodes time using a horizontal axis, enabling efficient visualization of causality-based sentiment flow while maintaining scalability through limitless spatial segmentation. Based on the visualization, we develop CausalMap, a system that supports analysts in tracing sentiment contagion pathways and assessing the influence of different demographic groups. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive evaluations——including two use cases, a task-based user study, an expert interview, and an algorithm evaluation——to validate the usability and effectiveness of our approach."

    "abstract": "As one of consumer unmanned electronic systems, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become ubiquitous in daily life, essential for numerous tasks, and will play a pivotal role in future wireless networks and Internet-of-Things. However, their widespread adoption and connectivity make them vulnerable to various cyber threats. Although deep learning-based attack detection models offer promising solutions for enhancing UAV network security, these models typically rely on manual trial-and-error approaches for determining hyper-parameters and neural architectures, resulting in limited generalization capability and often overlooking model lightweightness. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an innovative automated multi-objective recurrent neural network (RNN) with attention mechanism, called MoARNN-AM, to effectively solve attack detection problems in UAV systems. In MoARNN-AM, we consider six typical RNN variants and three widely-used attention mechanisms as core classification models for feature extraction and data learning of UAV systems. First, an effective encoding mechanism is developed to represent different combinations along with their corresponding hyper-parameters and neural architectures. Subsequently, considering both attack detection performance and model lightweightness as two objectives, we elaborately design an efficient non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II)-based evolutionary operation to evolve various combinations with their associated hyper-parameters and neural architectures for discovering optimized RNN with attention mechanism model. The performance of the proposed MoARNN-AM method is validated using two datasets, i.e., UAV-INDD dataset and WSN-DS dataset collected from different UAV systems. Experimental results demonstrate that MoARNN-AM outperforms five state-of-the-art manually designed attack detection models in terms of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">accuracy, precision, recall</i>, and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">F</i><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>-<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">score</i> metrics while maintaining superior model lightweightness."

The architecture is based on affective computing, empathy, and Theory of Mind (ToM) and uses a description of the user profile and the operational, professional, and ethical requirements of the domain in which the agent operates. Moreover, it encompasses: a Knowledge Graph (KG), which is aimed at representing the various kinds of knowledge of the scenario at hand; a Behavior Tree (BT) enhanced with empathy-aware capabilities; a neural component, which elaborates sensor input from devices that monitor the user and input from the KG. The enhanced BT is the component that interacts with the user, making actions or providing suggestions. It also returns feedback to the KG to update it based on user experience. This two-way interaction between KG and BT is a major novelty of our work. As further contributions, we showcase an application of the proposed architecture on a driver co-pilot scenario and provide an early stage implementation of our architecture, mainly based on a Prolog implementation of the BT component."

    "abstract": "To solve the problem of maximum power point tracking control of a wave energy conversion system (WECs), a prescribed time prescribed performance controller is designed. The mathematical model of direct-driven WECs considering actuator fault, internal parameter variations, and external perturbations is established. A prescribed time prescribed performance controller based on an adaptive sliding mode observer is proposed. The designed controller has the following three advantages: 1) The actual convergence time is only prescribed by a design parameter and is independent of the initial condition, and the convergence speed of the system is improved. 2) The adaptive sliding mode observer is designed to estimate the lumped uncertainties within a prescribed time and to compensate for them in the controller; it needn't to predict the upper bound of the derivative of lumped uncertainties, and the robustness of the system is improved. 3) By integrating a new asymmetric prescribed performance function with a prescribed time function, where the initial error has been incorporated into the envelope function, the problem of the initial error exceeding prescribed boundaries is resolved, and system transient performance is improved. Compared with conventional proportional-integral control and prescribed performance control, the designed controller has stronger robustness and faster response."

    "abstract": "Planning the trajectory for an autonomous vehicle (AV) requires considering both the AV's objectives and the behaviors of surrounding agents, which interact in a dynamic process. Joint prediction and planning (JPP) methods have been proposed to model this bidirectional interaction and generate compatible joint futures. However, existing methods often overlook the fundamental differences between the two tasks and treat them almost identically, thus limiting the effect of planning. In this work, we revisit JPP from a role-aware perspective and identify three inherent asymmetries between prediction and planning: information, objective, and feedback. Based on these insights, we propose the Role-Aware Joint Prediction and Planning (RAP) framework, which explicitly differentiates the treatment of the ego vehicle and surrounding agents through three lightweight asymmetric designs. Specifically, RAP introduces a route–identity token pairing mechanism for route-aware yet agent-agnostic conditioning, ego-only vectorized auxiliary losses for safety-constrained planning, and dropout and perturbation applied to the ego's history and kinematic state to improve closed-loop robustness. Comprehensive experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that RAP achieves state-of the-art performance on both open-loop and closed-loop metrics, validating the effectiveness of asymmetric modeling in unified prediction and planning."

    "abstract": "Sequential change detection in high-dimensional dynamic networks has attracted growing attention in modern applications. A major challenge is that as network scale increases, limited sensing resources make it difficult to fully observe links at each time point, resulting in partial observability and complicating detection. To tackle this, we propose a Latent Bi-Transit Network (LBTN) that learns unobserved edge formation, latent node states, and the evolution mechanisms of dynamic networks. Based on LBTN, we design a variational Bayesian method to infer sparse node-level changes and employ a likelihood ratio test as the detection statistic. By further formulating the statistic as the reward function of a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem, we develop a Thompson sampling strategy to adaptively select edges for observation, balancing exploration and exploitation. Comprehensive simulations and real-world experiments show that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines and its variants across diverse scenarios."

    "abstract": "In vehicle to grid (V2G), electric vehicles face the risk of privacy leakage when performing cross-domain authentication because of the openness and instability of mobile network. Although the existing conditional anonymous authentication schemes can both protect the vehicles' anonymity and trace the vehicles' real identity in case of malicious behaviors, the commonly used group signature and ring signature methods have limitations, such as high costs. Therefore, how to effectively apply conditional anonymous authentication in the V2G cross domain scenario to meet the high real-time requirements of V2G has become a key challenge. To address this challenge, we propose innovatively an efficient multi-level and cross-domain conditional anonymous authentication scheme in V2G. The scheme designs a unique multi-level architecture. The first level faces grid servers and uses the group signature whose group key is generated based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem for grid servers, and the second level faces vehicles and uses the proxy signature to generate conditional anonymous cross-domain signatures for vehicles. To further improve efficiency, our scheme also uses the online/offline signature. Thus, our scheme has less computational, communication, and storage costs compared to existing schemes. Through formal security model and analysis, the security of the proposed scheme is shown."

Simulation results show that Fuzzy Logic-based controllers outperform their conventional counterparts, with P-FLC and PI-FLC achieving better rise times, settling times, and disturbance rejection. Notably, P-FLC yields the best overall performance in three out of five scenarios. These results support the integration of Fuzzy Logic into PMDC motor control systems to improve precision, adaptability, and robustness."

    "abstract": "Arabic Handwriting Recognition (AHR) constitutes a challenging research problem primarily due to the cursive form of the script, the context-dependent character shape variations, and high inter-writer variability. We introduce a comprehensive review of recent progress on AHR, with a special emphasis on line-level recognition, where word- and character-level intricacies are folded into a smooth sequence. We discuss the development of AHR methods, from early segmentation-based pipelines to deep learning strategies with CNNs, RNNs, and, more recently, Transformer-based architectures. To illustrate the state of the art, we review the current systems, compare their architectures and performance, as well as their advantages and limitations. Motivated by these observations, in this work, we propose our ongoing work: a hybrid CNN-Transformer model which can leverage CNNs' strength in spatial feature extraction, and the long-range context modeling power of Transformers. In this, we try to increase the recognition accuracy and efficiency especially for real-life line-level handwriting situations."

    "abstract": "The increasing integration of renewable energy sources introduces significant uncertainty in distribution networks, necessitating advanced tools for assessing system flexibility. This paper presents a differentiable optimization-based framework for quantifying flexibility in distribution systems through implicit sensitivity analysis. By formulating the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem using a convexified Branch Flow Model (BFM), we enable gradient computation via the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and implicit differentiation. These gradients provide insight into how active power variations impact system variables such as branch flows and bus voltages. The proposed method constructs flexibility envelopes that bound system responses with a specified confidence level, enabling real-time evaluation of network adaptability under uncertainty. Simulation results on the IEEE 15-bus, 33-bus, and 141-bus systems demonstrate the accuracy and interpretability of the sensitivity-based estimation, highlighting its potential for planning and operational decision-making in power distribution systems across networks of varying sizes and complexities."

    "abstract": "Data centers are becoming a major consumer of electricity on the grid, with cooling accounting for about 40% of that energy. As electricity prices vary throughout the day and year, there is a need for cooling strategies that adapt to these fluctuations to reduce data center cooling costs. In this paper, we present a model for electricity price-aware cooling scheduling using a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to reliably estimate the cooling system’s operational costs and facilitate investment-phase decision-making. We utilize Quantile Fourier Regression (QFR) fits to classify electricity prices into different regimes while capturing both daily and seasonal patterns. We simulate 14 years of operation using historical real-time electricity price and outdoor temperature data, and compare our model against heuristic baselines. The results demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves lower cooling costs. This model is useful for grid operators interested in demand response programs and data center investors looking to make investment decisions."

The comparator was originally designed to address the stringent requirements of ferroelectric-based neurons, which demand asynchronous operation, ultra-low static power consumption, fast switching capabilities, and minimal input capacitance to avoid perturbation of neural dynamics. The proposed design employs current feedback techniques integrated into an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) architecture, enabling subthreshold operation with tail currents in the order of pA while providing high current drive capability during transitions. The comparator achieves high energy efficiency with an average static power consumption of 47 pW and dynamic energy consumption of 3 fJ per operation. Statistical analysis on 360 circuits across 180 dies demonstrates robust performance characteristics. The measured performance establishes new benchmarks for asynchronous comparators in neuromorphic applications, demonstrating six orders of magnitude improvement in static power consumption compared to existing static comparator designs."

Adsorption experiments showed that the functionalized membrane reached a cumulative removal efficiency of 93.70% after nine reuse cycles (15 mL at 10 ppm), with contact times of only 10 minutes per cycle. Although the nonfunctionalized membrane achieved a slightly higher total removal (98.84 %), it required a much longer contact time (120 min) and exhibited greater fouling. These results indicate that rPET/ZnO/GO membranes provide a faster, reusable, and more stable alternative for dye-contaminated wastewater treatment, aligning with circular economy and sustainable material development principles."

The first OTA uses a bulk-driven (BD) input stage and operates with a 400-mV supply, while the second adopts a gate-driven (GD) approach, incorporating an additional tail-current transistor to bias the differential pair, and thus requires a 500mV supply. Analytical modeling and simulation results are used to assess the trade-offs between the two architectures in terms of main performance parameters. In particular, the expected disadvantages in dc gain and gain-bandwidth for BD OTAs are found to be less severe than typically assumed, while their smaller required compensation capacitor enables improved Slew Rate. Noise performance remains a major drawback."

As a complement to the standard usage, this paper presents the concept of a minimum load coincidence factor characterizing the lower bound of coincident demand from a set of customers as it relates to the sum of their individual peak demands. Such a characterization can help to avoid unnecessary curtailment of local generation available in distribution networks in order to mitigate potential over-voltage issues possible under low loading conditions. We further examine statistical properties of both the standard maximum and proposed minimum load coincidence factors using publicly available data sets of household demand drawn from realistic distribution networks. The statistical analyses validate probabilistic modelling of both types of load coincidence factors for a large number of customers as a ratio of two Gaussian random variables. Probabilistic models of load coincidence factors are potentially useful in uncertainty-aware operational decision making via the solution of a robust or chance-constrained optimal dispatch."

Monitoring hemoglobin levels is essential for general health since they may indicate a variety of medical problems. Because there aren't enough healthy red blood cells, anemia, a frequent blood condition, lowers the body's capacity to deliver oxygen. Hemoglobin levels need to be measured precisely and promptly to identify and cure anemia. In this paper, hemoglobin levels in anemic individuals are accurately detected by a novel Internet of Things (IoT)-based device. This system monitors hemoglobin levels in a noninvasive, economical, and effective manner. The system uses image processing techniques to process conjunctival images from IoT devices. This innovative method correctly distinguishes between anemic and non-anemic conjunctival images using potent Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Proteus Design Suit used for circuit simulation and the hardware was developed accordingly. System performance and result show the proper detection and the anemia diagnosis will be enhanced by further validation using bigger datasets and system accuracy enhancements."

With the development of network communication technology, a large number of private protocols have emerged. The lack of public documentation makes it particularly difficult to analyze these protocols. Accurate protocol field segmentation is a key step in the analysis of unknown protocols. Traditional methods usually rely on known protocol formats, static rules, or template matching, which often do not work well when dealing with unknown protocols. To address this problem, this paper proposes a network protocol field segmentation method based on sequence common subset (SCSSeg). This method combines sequence alignment and iterative optimization to accurately extract static fields and effectively distinguish dynamic fields. By utilizing message correlation analysis, this method further improves the segmentation accuracy. Experimental results show that this method can efficiently and accurately extract field information in unknown protocols, which is superior to existing methods."

A swing equation-based model is developed to capture the fast transient frequency response, incorporating both inertial and primary frequency support (PFS) from synchronous generators and ESS. Closed-form expressions for key frequency security metrics—the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF), frequency nadir, and steady-state frequency—are derived and embedded as constraints within generator scheduling optimization. The proposed formulation minimizes operating costs and load curtailment while ensuring frequency stability without explicitly imposing load shedding after unintentional islanding."

Such developments disrupt the traditional protection systems, which were based on a fixed environment and the unidirectional assumption of fault. In dynamic conditions, static schemes tend to fail, which results in loss of coordination, fault misdetection and decreased reliability of the system. This review is a detailed review of real time adaptive protection strategies applicable to ADNs. We discover the architectural development of ADNs and the new protection issues first, including variable fault currents, dynamic topologies, and islanding. Hereafter we categorize protection systems of adaptation into centralized, local, and distributed strategies. The important technologies are analyzed, such as ML algorithms, multi agent systems, and hardware in the loop validation platforms. A comparative analysis shows trade-offs between response time, scalability, and communication dependency. Real-life examples of world pilot projects reveal implemented practices and existing restrictions. Lastly, the paper establishes research gaps that are outstanding in the area of latency management, cybersecurity, and standardization, and gives future development paths, including edge-computing architectures and plug-and-play protection of distributed energy resources (DERs).

Both offer promising good news for cement industry’s decarbonization efforts.One of the major cement industry’s decarbonization challenges is to reduce the clinker content in cement and substitute it by SCMs. With a projected decrease of the availability of granulated blast furnace slag and fly ash, clay has logically been considered as a relevant, abundant, and accessible natural resource to produce artificial pozzolans as SCM - activated clay.Beyond numerous academic project research programs, the development of industrial technologies to activate clay by calcination has gained a significant momentum in the cement industry. Know-how has been quickly progressing, but many challenges were also faced related to various process technology topics, proper equipment selection, as well as cement and concrete quality issues. Another promising clay activation process technology is currently under industrial development as an alternative to thermal clay activation. It is based on an already well-described process in the research literature for decades: mechanochemistry.The aim of the present paper is to characterize and compare both clay activation technologies."

In this work, we present a more sustainable method that uses sodium alginate as a viscoelastic medium and food-grade fish oil as the continuous phase. Fish oil is biodegradable and biocompatible, supporting the formation of stable droplets. Other food oils, like sunflower or olive oil, can also be used. Our tests confirmed that alginate exhibits shear-thinning properties and weak elasticity that help organize particles before they reach the junction. Under these conditions, we achieved single-particle encapsulation rates that we estimate to be statistically significant, and these rates are likely related to how particles align and synchronize with droplet formation. This method has practical advantages over electrospray and chitosan-based systems, including gentle gelation, scalability, and improved encapsulation accuracy. Overall, our approach offers a reliable and environmentally friendly method for encapsulating particles and cells in microfluidic systems."

Traditionally performed on-site, this task has evolved with the proliferation of smart metering infrastructure into a data-driven process using time-series voltage data and unsupervised learning techniques like clustering. Spectral clustering, in particular, depends on how effectively one can construct a graph to observe similarities and dissimilarities of voltage patterns. Graph-based methods thus have become powerful tools for analyzing complex networks, and time series, where graph construction techniques such as similarity, ensemble Co-Association, and spatial smoothness are commonly used. However, these often overlook volatility a critical feature of smart meter data, where minor spikes or shifts can significantly alter clustering outcomes. To address this, we propose a new method of constructing graphs through multiresolution analysis using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), enabling the decomposition of signals across multiple frequency bands. We then infer graph structures within each band and fuse them using a spectral perturbation-based approach, weighted by graph partitioning metrics like modularity. Our experimental results show that the multiresolution ensemble consensus graph learning is an effective method in addressing the phase identification problem."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a control strategy to mitigate sub-synchronous oscillations (SSO) in inverter-based power systems by integrating adaptive control and a high-pass filter (HPF) into the phase-locked loop (PLL) structure. Based on the enhanced PLL model, the positive-sequence impedance (Z<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">pp</inf>) of a grid-connected inverter with an LCL filter is analytically derived, capturing the dynamic influence of control loops. While conventional PLL configurations are vulnerable to SSO, the proposed method, combining adaptive control tuning with HPF, effectively suppresses these oscillations. Theoretical analyses and frequency-domain simulations demonstrate improvements in system stability and dynamic performance, especially in scenarios with low short-circuit ratios (SCR)."

This study introduces a technologically integrated workflow that leverages aerial imaging, spatial data processing, and deep neural networks to monitor invasive vegetation across diverse ecosystems. Utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-resolution sensors, large-scale image datasets were gathered and refined through advanced enhancement techniques to counteract environmental variability. These images were processed using a custom-trained deep learning model optimized for multiclass plant classification. By aligning object detection results with RTK-enhanced GPS coordinates, the system generated precise geospatial maps delineating the distribution and density of harmful plant species. The analysis uncovered species-specific clustering patterns and revealed areas where beneficial vegetation mitigates invasive encroachment. With robust classification accuracy and spatial fidelity, the framework offers a scalable solution for ecosystem monitoring and land-use planning. The findings underscore the potential of combining real-time drone analytics with AI-based mapping for proactive, data-driven ecological management."

    "abstract": "Nearly all insurance operations are dependent on risk prediction, the accuracy and fairness of which is paramount. Traditional models of underwriting and risk assessment generally fail to exhibit the complexity and interrelationships associated with an interconnected portfolio. This paper proposes the Graph-Causal-Transformer (GCT) an innovative machine learning architecture that employs graph neural networks, causal inference, and transformer based attention to allow for a more holistic and interpretable consideration of insurance risk. Whereas conventional models assume policyholders represent independent risks, the GCT augments its models of risk by directly modeling relationships between policyholders, assets, and their context, such as supply chains or relative distance. It also distinguishes true causal drivers (or influences) from false correlations. The GCT is evaluated using a very large scale auto insurance dataset augmented with alternative datasets. The GCT model performed better than Generalised Linear Models, XGBoost, Graph Neural Networks and Actuarial Transformers depending upon the performance metric employed, namely AUC, Gini, loss-ratio uplift and fairness. The GCT provides a high degree of interpretability through SHAP based local explanations and causal path insights, therefore supporting those firms who need to comply with emerging regulations associated with the rise of AI. The findings of this study demonstrate that the GCT provides predictive performance benefits while enhancing transparency and governance whilst making it an important candidate for future algorithmic underwriting applications in regulated insurance markets."

We ask whether sub-5 B-parameter open-source VLMs can achieve comparable performance on a single RTX-class GPU. To this end, we generated a corpus of 1500 synthetic French prescriptions and benchmarked five sub-5B-parameter opensource VLMs against Amazon Nova Pro with five evaluation metrics. The results establish a baseline for fully on-premise, privacy-preserving prescription parsing and motivate lightweight fine-tuning to further close the gap with large-scale APIs."

These embeddings inform the decisions of a reinforcement learning agent, which incrementally updates the schema by selecting among actions—Add, Merge, Modify, or Ignore—based on long-term optimization of semantic coherence, structural compactness, and constraint compliance. A reward function guides policy learning by incorporating constraint violations and redundancy metrics. The framework also supports the continuous inference and refinement of cardinality and datatype constraints, enabling the schema to adapt over time to evolving data structures in schema-less NoSQL environments."

This paper presents a bridge structural damage detection method based on Covariance-driven Stochastic Subspace Identification (Cov-SSI) and hypothesis testing. A vibration sensor network is deployed to collect bridge vibration data, providing high-quality input for subsequent modal analysis. The proposed method performs modal identification using the long-term bridge vibration data, extracts stable modal frequencies using the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, and ultimately applies the two-sample two-tailed t-test to determine the damage state of the bridge. This study utilizes data from the Swiss Z24 bridge for validation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigates the influence of environmental factors, accurately identifies bridge damage in a timely manner, and provides a reliable basis for preventive maintenance.

    "abstract": "Although data visualization is powerful for revealing patterns and communicating insights, creating effective visualizations requires familiarity with authoring tools and often disrupts the analysis flow. While large language models show promise for automatically converting analysis intent into visualizations, existing methods function as black boxes without transparent reasoning processes, which prevents users from understanding design rationales and refining suboptimal outputs. To bridge this gap, we propose integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the Natural Language to Visualization (NL2VIS) pipeline. First, we design a comprehensive CoT reasoning process for NL2VIS and develop an automatic pipeline to equip existing datasets with structured reasoning steps. Second, we introduce nvBench-CoT, a specialized dataset capturing detailed step-by-step reasoning from ambiguous natural language descriptions to finalized visualizations, which enables state-of-the-art performance when used for model fine-tuning. Third, we develop DeepVIS, an interactive visual interface that tightly integrates with the CoT reasoning process, allowing users to inspect reasoning steps, identify errors, and make targeted adjustments to improve visualization outcomes. Quantitative benchmark evaluations, two use cases, and a user study collectively demonstrate that our CoT framework effectively enhances NL2VIS quality while providing insightful reasoning steps to users."

This task is particularly challenging due to two key sources of uncertainty: <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">limited visual observations</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">an enormous decision space</i>. The former results in multiple plausible plan variations due to missing intermediate visual states, while the latter complicates prediction by requiring selection from a large set of potential actions. Unlike prior work that addresses these issues implicitly, we propose an explicit solution. To mitigate the first challenge, we employ image generation models to synthesize diverse intermediate visual states using various text prompts, followed by a prompt selection module integrated within a diffusion model. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce a task-selective diffusion model that applies a task-specific mask to constrain the action space. As the effectiveness of this mask depends on accurate task classification, we further enhance visual representation by leveraging pre-trained vision-language models to generate action-aware, text-enriched multimodal embeddings. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of our approach.

    "abstract": "The spiking federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed learning paradigm that allows resource-constrained devices to train collaboratively at low power consumption without exchanging local data. It takes advantage of both the privacy computation property in FL and the energy efficiency in spiking neural networks (SNNs). However, existing spiking FL methods employ a random selection approach for client aggregation, assuming unbiased client participation. This neglect of statistical heterogeneity significantly affects the convergence and precision of the global model. In this work, we propose a credit assignment-based active client selection strategy for spiking federated learning, the SFedCA, to aggregate clients contributing to the global sample distribution balance judiciously. Specifically, the client credits are assigned by the firing intensity state before and after local model training, which reflects the difference in local data distribution from the global model. The comprehensive experiments are conducted on various non-identical and independent distribution (non-IID) scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate that the SFedCA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art spiking FL methods and requires fewer communication rounds."

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a measurement framework that consists of an image expansion part, EF-Gen, and an improved detection algorithm component. In particular, EF-Gen is a reality-based anomalous image generation pipeline that synthesizes high-fidelity industrial defect data with controlled diversity. EF-Gen blends empirical processing that uses Blender’s physics-based rendering to recreate the fundamental features of industrial parts with fine-tuning methods that use PiSSA-trained Stable Diffusion for photorealistic style transfer. This two-stage approach ensures that the images input to the downstream have accurate feature reproduction and give feedback on real-world imaging conditions. Furthermore, we improve YOLOv8 by incorporating a Spatial and Channel Synergistic Attention (SCSA) mechanism and an advanced loss function, Inner-Focaler-GIoU, to form the second part of the framework to increase downstream detection performance. Extensive tests on the Briquette, VisA, and MVTec datasets demonstrate the superiority of the measurement framework. The EF-Gen-produced images achieve state-of-the-art PSNR (24.3 dB), SSIM (0.641), and FID (10.43) scores, significantly outperforming methods such as StyleGAN3 and RealNet. The importance of each element in EF-Gen and the effectiveness of the YOLOv8 improvements are then demonstrated through a two-part ablation experiment. The effect of the amount of generated data on the measurement framework is also verified. This work succeeds in improving the performance and reliability of industrial defect detection under data-scarce conditions by introducing a novel measurement framework, which provides alternative answers to related questions in measurement science."

    "abstract": "Internet and IoT applications have generated increasing amounts of data that require efficient storage. Many persistent memory file systems have been designed to handle high-performance storage demands by fully exploiting the senior features of persistent memory (PM). However, PMs suffer from limited write endurance. Existing PM file systems achieve PM wear-leveling by designing wear-leveling-aware allocators. These allocators focus on providing higher-balanced writes to PMs while neglecting the overhead. Moreover, they cause serious request conflicts in parallel block requests by multiple threads in modern multiprocessor computer systems. In this paper, we propose an efficient wear-leveling-aware parallel allocator, WPAlloc, for persistent memory file systems to achieve wear-leveling of PM and high parallel performance. The essential idea of WPAlloc is to allocate blocks with lower write counters for each allocation request and to provide parallel block allocation and deallocation for multiple threads via one free list per logical processor. WPAlloc consists of two key techniques: the bucket sort-based range management scheme (BRMS) and the parallel allocation and deallocation scheme (PADS). First, we design the BRMS to obtain the less worn free blocks. Based on BRMS, an online wear range adjustment algorithm has been designed to adjust the wear range dynamically. Then, we present the PADS to avoid request conflicts by multiple threads. We implement WPAlloc based on PMFS. Experimental results show that WPAlloc can reduce the maximum write by 54.2%, 10.2%, and 55.7%, while achieving average performance improvements of 5.68%, 54.18%, and 11.28% compared to PMFS, DWARM, and WASA, respectively."

    "abstract": "Fusion of features from the time-domain, frequency-domain, and time–frequency (TF) domain significantly boosts the robustness of classification methods by providing a more comprehensive data representation. However, this fusion process can lead to challenges in maintaining distinct features from different domains, causing a loss of important information. To address these challenges, a novel attentional multidomain feature fusion network (AMFFNet) is introduced, which integrates features from the time, frequency, and TF domains using a three-branch feature fusion (TBFF) mechanism powered by attentional cross-correlation. A key component of this network is the adaptive personalized feature selection, which uses deep shapley additive explanations to identify and prioritize features across different domains, addressing the issue of irrelevant information overload. The TBFF enhances feature mapping by focusing on the most contributive features, ensuring that the network captures critical information while minimizing noise. By combining these features, the AMFFNet with the TBFF provides a comprehensive representation of the input multidomain features, preserving the most relevant aspects from each domain without significant loss of information. Comparative experiments on three curated public underwater acoustic signal data sets, marine mammal sound, ShipsEar, and combined underwater acoustic, covering six categories of signal sources (whale, dolphin, fish, seal, sea lion, and ship), demonstrate that the proposed method achieves robust classification performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods."

This study aimed to develop an automated slip detection algorithm, designed to replace human observers in human-centered footwear testing protocols and provide a proof of concept for future real-world assessment. A parallel network architecture was proposed to classify videos into slip and no slip events, consisting of two distinct models: Inflated 3D convolutional neural networks (I3D) and Multiscale Vision Transformer (MViT). The two models operate in parallel, independently processing the input video data to capture diverse temporal and spatial features. To optimize the network, predictions from each model are aggregated by fusing their losses using a weighted averaging mechanism, ensuring a balanced contribution during training. The proposed approach was evaluated using two cross-validation techniques: 5-fold and Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) to assess both overall performance and generalizability across subjects. Our proposed parallel network achieved the highest performance in both cross-validation techniques, with an accuracy of 94.63% ± 1.39% (5-fold) and 93.37% ± 3.02% (LOSO), and an F1 score of 94.33% ± 1.46% (5-fold) and 93.02% ± 2.93% (LOSO) on unseen test data. Notably, it outperformed standalone I3D and MViT models by approximately 7% and 4%, respectively."

Under the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, a MADDPG-based topology reconfiguration algorithm is developed that integrates partial observability with a bi-directional interest game, enabling nodes to achieve distributed Nash equilibrium decisions under local information constraints. At the communication layer, a channel model, topology maintenance scheme, and CSDMA-based distributed slot allocation process are introduced to ensure reliable connectivity in the presence of interference and dynamic node access. Simulation results show that the proposed method attains faster convergence, greater robustness, lower communication latency, and higher path efficiency than benchmark approaches such as MST and PSO, with reconfiguration completed within milliseconds. These results highlight both the effectiveness and scalability of the framework for large-scale swarm networking. Beyond its theoretical contributions, the approach holds practical promise for deployment in critical scenarios such as emergency communications, disaster relief, and mission-critical operations, offering a viable pathway toward intelligent UAV swarm networks."

    "abstract": "To effectively support the execution of quantum network applications for multiple sets of user-controlled quantum nodes, a quantum network must efficiently allocate shared resources. We study traffic models for a type of quantum network hub called an Entanglement Generation Switch (EGS), a device that allocates resources to enable entanglement generation between nodes in response to user-generated demand. We propose an on-demand resource allocation algorithm, where a demand is either blocked if no resources are available or else results in immediate resource allocation. We model the EGS as an Erlang loss system, with demands corresponding to sessions whose arrival is modeled as a Poisson process. To reflect the operation of a practical quantum switch, our model captures scenarios where a resource is allocated for batches of entanglement generation attempts, possibly interleaved with calibration periods for the quantum network nodes. Calibration periods are necessary to correct against drifts or jumps in the physical parameters of a quantum node that occur on a timescale that is long compared to the duration of an attempt. We then derive a formula for the demand blocking probability under three different traffic scenarios using analytical methods from applied probability and queueing theory. We prove an insensitivity theorem which guarantees that the probability a demand is blocked only depends upon the mean duration of each entanglement generation attempt and calibration period, and is not sensitive to the underlying distributions of attempt and calibration period duration. We provide numerical results to support our analysis. Our numerical results suggest that there exist parameter regimes where it is beneficial for nodes to relinquish control of EGS resources during their calibration periods. This benefit is quantified by the blocking probability and the total entanglement generated in a fixed period of time. Our work is the first analysis of traffic characteristics at an EGS system and provides a valuable analytic tool for devising performance driven resource allocation algorithms."

    "abstract": "The space-missile bistatic radar system can achieve anti-survey, anti-interference, and payload reduction from a configuration perspective. Meanwhile, the unique conformal array and motion pattern of the missile-borne radar platform lead to a broadened clutter spectrum, which distinguishes the clutter characteristics of missile-borne radars from those of traditional planar array radars, thus causing difficulties in moving target detection and making the clutter characteristics more irregular and complicating clutter suppression. To address these issues, this paper presents a method for clutter signal modeling in a bistatic radar system with satellite transmission and missile-borne conformal array reception. Subsequently, to effectively enhance the capability of clutter suppression, a method for subarray partitioning of the conformal array is provided. Based on this, a design criterion for reducing the main lobe clutter width in the bistatic radar system with satellite transmission and missile reception is presented. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed design criteria and modeling method as well as the superiority of the conformal array in suppressing range-ambiguous clutter are verified through simulations of clutter signals in the bistatic radar system with low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite transmitter as well as missile-borne receiver. This paper can serve as an important reference guide for the actual engineering configuration design of space-missile bistatic radar systems."

We address the problem of sparse parametric channel estimation in mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems by formulating it as a gridless multi-dimensional (M-D) spectral estimation problem. The channel is modeled as a sparse linear combination of steering vectors (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">atoms</i>) parametrized in the continuous angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of departure (AoD) domain. To avoid grid mismatch and enhance resolution, we adopt an atomic norm (AN) framework and distinctly address structured pilot-based measurements and heterogeneous array deployments. We derive recovery conditions in the noiseless scenario, linking them to array geometry and pilot design. Simulations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SotA) approaches in both noiseless and noisy scenarios, in terms of estimation accuracy at equivalent complexity, making it suitable for practical mmWave systems with irregular or constrained array layouts."

    "abstract": "Composite federated learning offers a general framework for solving machine learning problems with additional regularization terms. However, existing methods often face significant limitations: many require clients to perform computationally expensive proximal operations, and their performance is frequently vulnerable to data heterogeneity. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel composite federated learning algorithm called FedCanon, designed to solve the optimization problems comprising a possibly non-convex loss function and a weakly convex, potentially non-smooth regularization term. By decoupling proximal mappings from local updates, FedCanon requires only a single proximal evaluation on the server per iteration, thereby reducing the overall proximal computation cost. Concurrently, it integrates control variables into local updates to mitigate the client drift arising from data heterogeneity. The entire architecture avoids the complex subproblems of primal-dual alternatives. The theoretical analysis provides the first rigorous convergence guarantees for this proximal-skipping framework in the general non-convex setting. It establishes that FedCanon achieves a sublinear convergence rate, and a linear rate under the Polyak-Łojasiewicz condition, without the restrictive bounded heterogeneity assumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedCanon outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly under heterogeneous data distributions."

The study assesses the impact of these schemes on the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) across various network layouts, demonstrating that network coding can significantly improve transmission robustness over traditional forwarding techniques. Notably, NC-based schemes achieved up to 8.6% and 22.9% improvements in PDR under comparable total transmit power conditions compared to DAF and NoC, respectively. Furthermore, NC-based schemes maintained high reliability while operating at transmit power levels up to 63 times lower than simpler cooperation methods.

    "abstract": "Semantic communication (SemCom) leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to prioritize meaningful information exchange, significantly enhancing efficiency and resource utilization in next-generation wireless networks. Despite its potential, practical deployment within multi-tier, heterogeneous edge-cloud systems presents substantial challenges, including diverse device computational capabilities, varying communication resources, and semantic mismatches between user encoders and edge-server decoders. To overcome these challenges, we propose <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SemCom-OPTIMA</b>, a comprehensive optimization framework specifically designed for maximizing semantic image reconstruction accuracy in multi-user, multi-edge environments under strict latency and energy constraints. The problem is formulated as a joint mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model, incorporating user-edge associations, semantic masking ratios, CPU frequency scaling, and joint power-bandwidth allocation. Given its NP-hard complexity, we present a multi-stage decomposition algorithm, solving iteratively tractable subproblems for semantic-computational allocation, channel resource management, and adaptive user-edge association, while ensuring convergence and feasibility. Distinctively, this work is grounded in extensive empirical analysis involving a rigorous 600,000-sample design-space exploration spanning masking ratios (0-0.99), signal-to-noise ratios (1-16 dB), and diverse semantic image classes (1000 ImageNet labels). Experiments conducted on a realistic 10-user, 3-edge testbed demonstrate that SemCom-OPTIMA consistently achieves a 10-12% higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and robustly meets energy and latency constraints compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an aerial-marine integrated network architecture tailored for maritime search and rescue (MSAR) operations, where a high altitude platform station (HAPS) and maritime autonomous surface ships (MASSs) are equipped with edge servers, providing computing services for surveillance unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These UAVs generate substantial volumes of computation-intensive and delay sensitive tasks, some of which can be strategically offloaded to both MASSs and HAPSs for distributed processing. We formulate the joint task offloading and resource allocation as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) to minimize the system computation overhead (CO), quantified by a weighted sum of task completion time and energy consumption. Given the stochastic nature of task arrivals from UAVs and the dynamic characteristics of marine channel conditions, we employ a two-stage optimization to decompose the problem into four tractable subproblems, i.e., (1) edge server selection, (2) transmission power allocation, (3) edge computing resource allocation, and (4) local computation resource allocation. In stage I, we optimize the edge server selection via many-to-one matching. In stage II, we determine the transmission power of each UAV with quasi-convex optimization and solve the edge computing and local computing resource allocation subproblems via a projected gradient descent method and convex optimization, respectively. Simulation results validate that the proposed scheme can achieve superior system performance over benchmark schemes."

Conventional metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, and METEOR often fail to capture legal specificity, factual completeness, and logical consistency. This study introduces LEAD (Legal Evaluation and Assessment using Discrimination), a reference-free evaluation framework designed specifically for legal summarization. LEAD employs a contrastive learning approach and pre-trained legal language models to assess summaries across four core dimensions: legal relevance, logical consistency, fluency, and coherence. Applied to a dataset of AI-generated extractive summaries, the average LEAD score across all legal judgments was 0.5404. Statistical analysis using human-evaluated scores demonstrated that LEAD exhibits significantly higher correlation with expert judgment compared to traditional metrics. Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall correlation coefficients confirmed LEAD’s superior alignment with human evaluation. These results establish LEAD as a robust and interpretable alternative for legal summary evaluation, especially in scenarios lacking gold-standard references."

In order to solve this problem, the node adaptive control law and edge adaptive control law are introdued. In the node-based adaptive control law, agents dynamically adjust their weights through parameters tuning, whereas the edge-based adaptive control law introduces additional adjustable parameters to enable the multi-agent system to autonomously regulate the gain size. Compared with the aggregation game discussed earlier, it can make the agent adjust its behavior under the condition of complete information. Then, it is proved that the GNE of the system can remain asymptotically stable under these two strategies. Although preliminary explorations of disturbances mitigation in GNE problems exist in the literature, the dynamic compensation mechanisms and system performance control under bounded disturbances in aggregation games with coupling constraints remain insufficiently explored. In this article, the disturbances compensations are designed to minimize the damage of the system by keeping the system stable when bounded disturbances occur in the aggregate game under coupling constraints. Finally, the real effectiveness of the designed strategy is proved by simulation experiments."

    "abstract": "While tool learning significantly enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), it also introduces substantial security risks to real-world systems, such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Prior research has revealed various vulnerabilities in traditional LLMs during tool learning. However, the safety of newly emerging reasoning LLMs (RLLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, in the context of tool learning remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose RRTL, a red teaming approach specifically designed to evaluate RLLMs in tool learning. RRTL covers three critical components: (1) the identification of deceptive threats, aimed at evaluating RLLM’s behavior in concealing the usage of unsafe tools and their potential risks; (2) the use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to force tool invocation for malicious queries; and (3) the investigation of tool-calling safety scenarios, which evaluates RLLM’s safety-related behaviors and identifies factors contributing to security risks. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on seven mainstream RLLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) RLLMs can pose serious deceptive risks by frequently failing to disclose tool usage and to warn users of potential tool output risks; (2) CoT prompting reveals multilingual safety vulnerabilities in RLLMs; and (3) RLLMs exhibit significant variability in security behaviors across different tool invocation scenarios. Our work deepens the understanding of RLLM safety in tool learning and provides insights for developing secure and trustworthy IoT-enabled agents.

    "abstract": "Compared to conventional image content analysis tasks, visual emotion analysis is perceived as a complex, abstract, and potentially culturally dependent endeavor. The accuracy of automatic image-based emotion recognition remains a challenge, and the most significant obstacles are the affective gap and scarcity of data, particularly labeled data. To address these challenge, this paper proposes a saliency-guided masked image modeling approach. Specifically, the proposed framework employs multi-modal large model to generate more emotional images, thereby reducing the impact of data scarcity on model performance. Subsequently, neuroimaging and behavioral studies have demonstrated that human visual attention is attracted by the emotional relevance of a stimulus. In light of this, our model employs a saliency-guided masking strategy to identify emotion-related regions for masking sampling to fit the affective gap. In contrast to the conventional approach of using the original pixel values for the reconstruction target, our model eliminates high-frequency components from the pixels, thus enhancing the generalizability of the model. The use of this unsupervised representation learning approach enables the model to exhibit outstanding recognition performance in downstream emotion recognition tasks on three standard emotion datasets. Furthermore, ablation experiments, robustness test, and visualization experiments corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

In this article, we design a light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-based perception-planning autonomous system for a USV to dock to an uncooperative vessel without using Global Navigation Satellite System signal, where the uncooperative vessel is defined to be anchored yet subject to swing or drift due to waves or currents, with no communication or pose sharing except providing two proper sides for docking. To achieve successful docking, we first employ a clustering algorithm and L-shape fitting for onboard LiDAR-based object detection to locate the target and estimate its heading. Next, we develop a perception-integrated Dubins path planning method to generate a smooth trajectory around the target, enabling precise heading estimation by the LiDARs for final docking. Finally, we incorporate a station-keeping mechanism to ensure stable attachment to the target, forming a comprehensive solution. Real-world experiments under sea state three conditions confirm the robustness of this approach."

    "abstract": "With a high proportion of centralized renewable energy sources (RESs) access to the power system, the impact of its volatility on the system adequacy continues to increase. The situation of securing power supply is severe, so there is an urgent need to coordinate source-load-storage resources at multi-network levels to enhance the system adequacy. However, how to realize source-load-storage resources regulation under the consideration of transmission-distribution-microgrid system coordination remains to be studied. To this end, this paper proposes a decentralized scheduling framework for transmission-distribution-microgrid system coordination. In this framework, transmission network (TN), distribution networks (DNs) and microgrids (MGs) exchange energy and reserve to enhance system adequacy in a decentralized interaction based on locational marginal price (LMP) and uncertainty-aware locational marginal price (U-LMP). The whole coordination is modeled as an energy and reserve optimization problem with coupled variables between TN, DNs and MGs, and it is decomposed into multi-block subproblems using the Proximal Jacobian ADMM (PJ-ADMM) algorithm to solve in a decentralized manner. The numerical results validate that the proposed method can effectively improve the economy and adequacy of the power system."

The GPRs are well suited for the complexity and nonlinearity that characterizes power distribution networks. This work provides a detailed mathematical formulation of the GPR, proposes a ­scalable GPR-DOPF to address computational inefficiency with large datasets, and models the SI control modes and other voltage-regulating devices for application in the DOPF. The GPR is trained (assuming no significant physical changes in the network) using the extensive power flow data obtained from the power distribution network. To determine the optimal settings of the SIs and the legacy devices using the GPR-DOPF, a multiobjective mixed integer nonlinear problem (MINLP) is formulated. The GPR model is coupled with the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II) to determine the pareto optimal solutions (POSs) of the proposed MINLP formulation. The mathematical objectives include minimizing the voltage deviation and the overall network active power loss."

However, for silicon-based devices, which are the most commercially accessible, our circuits fail to produce meaningful output power beyond a few hundred GHz, and as the frequency and bandwidth increase, the effects of noise and phase noise become more and more prominent. Until recently, communication systems above <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$f_{\\max }/2$</tex-math> </inline-formula> have been struggling to reach highly complex (16QAM and above) modulation schemes largely due to difficulties inherent to achieving phase coherency and high SNR. The system presented herein uses a Kramers–Kronig transmitter, which suggests the ability to reconstruct the signal’s phase by only measuring amplitude. We showcase an integrated transmitter that achieves phase coherency using fully on-chip free-running oscillators above <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$f_{\\max }/2$</tex-math> </inline-formula>. By pursuing this style of wireless communications, future works may potentially be able to realize phase-encoded fully integrated systems without off-chip sources or exceedingly difficult PLLs. By reaching high-order QAM schemes, transmitter data rates above 200-GHz carrier have the opportunity to rapidly increase with respect to the current state-of-the-art."

However, traditional scene representations typically capture only static semantics and lack interpretable contextual reasoning, limiting their ability to guide object search in completely unfamiliar settings. To address this challenge, we propose a language-enhanced hierarchical navigation framework that tightly integrates semantic perception and spatial reasoning. Our method, Goal-Oriented Dynamically Heuristic-Guided Hierarchical Search (GODHS), leverages large language models (LLMs) to infer scene semantics and guide the search process through a multi-level decision hierarchy. Reliability in reasoning is achieved through the use of structured prompts and logical constraints applied at each stage of the hierarchy. For the specific challenges of mobile manipulation, we introduce a heuristic-based motion planner that combines polar angle sorting with distance prioritization to efficiently generate exploration paths. Comprehensive evaluations in Isaac Sim demonstrate the feasibility of our framework, showing that GODHS can locate target objects with higher search efficiency compared to conventional, nonsemantic search strategies.

    "abstract": "With the increasing intelligence and complexity of industrial control systems, industrial network data exhibit high dimensionality and complex inter-feature correlations. This poses significant challenges for traditional anomaly detection algorithms, including high computational complexity and the curse of distance concentration, making it difficult to accurately identify anomalous samples. Subspace partitioning has emerged as a common and effective solution to alleviate the challenges posed by high-dimensional data. However, traditional subspace partitioning methods often rely on simplistic similarity metrics or fixed parameters, which limits their representational capacity and impairs their ability to capture intricate feature relationships. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel anomaly detection method based on multi-scale feature clustering. First, a multi-scale feature similarity metric is designed by integrating mutual information with a Gaussian kernel function. Second, a density estimation-based adaptive cluster center initialization algorithm is introduced to effectively partition high-dimensional data into subspaces. Finally, a feature entropy-based weighted ensemble strategy is employed to integrate anomaly detection results across subspaces. Experimental results on three industrial network datasets demonstrate that the proposed method effectively performs subspace partitioning and consistently outperforms existing subspace-based approaches in terms of detection performance."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design and performance evaluation of a passivity-based proportional-integral control (PIPBC) strategy for a single-phase pulse-width modulated current source converter (PWM-CSC) supplying a linear load. The control law is derived from a port-Hamiltonian representation of the converter in order to ensure asymptotic stability using a Lyapunov-based approach with component-wise error signals. To improve the transient response and the method's robustness under varying operating conditions, various gain scheduling strategies are examined, including constant gains, inverse scaling, and proportional scaling based on stored energy, as well as interpolation techniques using polynomial functions. The simulation results show that the proportional gain scaling method outperforms the other approaches in terms of the output current's dynamic response and its total harmonic distortion (THD). This strategy strikes a superior balance between settling time, overshoot, and harmonic attenuation, making it a strong alternative for high-performance power electronics applications. This study concludes with a comparative analysis of the implemented control schemes and provides some considerations for future hardware validation."

    "abstract": "The increasing intensity and occurrence of high impact low probability (HILP) events require improved resilience in power grids, particularly through accurate modeling of fragility curves for critical infrastructure. This paper reviews existing methodologies for developing fragility curves for substation components under HILP events. Simulations are conducted in MATLAB to illustrate and analyze fragility curves specifically for wildfires, ice storms, and floods, examining how these curves evolve with changes in event intensity. The results demonstrate detailed impacts of varying event intensities on the probability of component failures, clearly identifying the vulnerabilities of substations, transformers, and distribution poles. The paper concludes by suggesting future research directions for developing proactive grid management strategies."

The morphing spherical shell constitutes an independent system exhibiting high compatibility with various driving methods. It also provides adequate placement space for internal components with a high internal space ratio of 70% in its contracted state. And the soft outer covering film of the shell ensures the sealing and waterproof properties.

    "abstract": "Analyzing plant microbiomes from genomic data begins with sequence alignment. Sequence alignment is a significant step in removing host genomic sequences from mixed deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) reads. Tools based on the Burrows– Wheeler Alignment algorithm, such as Bowtie 2, are widely used for sequence alignment due to their balance of speed and accuracy; however, they can become computational bottlenecks when applied to large-scale sequencing data. We introduce a Message Passing Interface based (MPI)-based parallel Bowtie 2 framework using the MapReduce paradigm to accelerate the alignment process. By distributing workloads across multiple processing nodes, our approach significantly reduces execution time while maintaining accuracy. Unlike traditional parallelized approaches that rely on specific cloud-based infrastructures or software frameworks such as Hadoop, our implementation is designed to run efficiently on general-purpose, high-performance computing environments without requiring such dependencies. This makes it suitable for academic and resource-constrained settings. Beyond alignment, the system improves the overall plant microbiome analysis pipeline. It can be integrated with downstream tasks such as taxonomic classification and functional gene prediction. This allows for concurrent processing of multiple datasets and a more streamlined, scalable workflow. As a result, the proposed method reduces the total runtime by approximately 48.85 percent compared to the traditional method, without any loss in alignment quality. These findings highlight the potential of our approach to make microbiome analysis faster, more scalable, and more accessible to researchers."

    "abstract": "With the advent of the big data era, deep learning techniques have achieved remarkable success in image classification. However, their heavy reliance on large-scale annotated data limits the generalization capability of models on unseen data types, particularly in complex scenarios where traditional methods face challenges such as low annotation efficiency and strong subjectivity. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-attention contrastive learning-based image classification algorithm. By improving the ResNet50 architecture in the SimCLR framework with the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), our method improves the model’s ability to extract finegrained image details. CBAM uses channel and spatial attention mechanisms to focus on the importance of feature channels and key spatial regions, respectively, thereby enhancing the model adaptability to complex scenes. Experiments conducted on the CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets demonstrate that our improved SimCLR model outperforms conventional SimCLRRes18 and SimCLR-Res50 models in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy. By incorporating CBAM into ResNet50, our approach significantly enhances the performance of the model in image classification tasks. The results indicate that this method not only reduces dependence on labeled data but also improves generalization capability and classification precision, showcasing broad application potential."

    "abstract": "Advancements in the electrical safety culture have led to increased awareness of electrical hazard exposure in the workplace. This attention has led to an emphasis on proper hazard identification and incorporation of safety by design concepts to enable risk reduction. These efforts closely examine worker tasks and how controls might be applied in the design process. Performing risk assessment as defined by NFPA 70E, requires that exposure to electrical hazards is evaluated prior to working on energized equipment. A critical step such as verifying the absence of voltage is part of establishing electrical safe work conditions. Still, the task presents a challenge to electrical workers when exposure to live buses and connections is inevitable. A variety of technologies exist such as the use of permanently mounted voltage testing products to assist employees in verifying the absence of voltage within the electrical circuit before gaining access for maintenance or troubleshooting; however, each of them provides different levels of functionality and capabilities. This paper discusses the importance of the absence of voltage testing, available technologies, and its key role in the electrical maintenance program (EMP) and compliance with NFPA 70B. A rigorous EMP provides a framework to safeguard people, which in turn reduces the risk of downtime and equipment failure."

    "abstract": "Demand response (DR) is increasingly expected to supply the fast, low-cost flexibility needed for decarbonizing the power system. Yet, field programs rarely achieve their technical potential. This paper argues that part of the shortfall is an over reliance on small financial incentives that are not sufficient to promote behavioral change. The paper explores alternative paths through cognitive evaluation theory and the theory of planned behavior. The paper reviews relevant literature and analyzes some of the results. Our synthesis reveals three consistent patterns. First, poorly calibrated monetary incentives can crowd out intrinsic and pro-environmental motives, causing engagement to decay after initial participation. Second, attitudes toward environmental benefit and perceived behavioral control explain more variance in enrolment and load-shifting than expected bill savings. Third, social-norm feedback and home-automation technologies amplify these positive drivers when they enhance rather than diminish users’ sense of autonomy. Guided by these insights we propose a pathway for further research on psychology-informed design framework that combines motivationally aligned incentives, identity-based messaging, and privacy-preserving feedback. We expect that integrating behavioral theory with engineering practice is pivotal for turning DR from a limited resource into a dependable balancing grid tool."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Traditional long-term microgrid planning models assume constant power charging for battery energy storage systems (BESS), overlooking efficiency losses that occur toward the end of charge due to rising internal resistance. While this issue can be mitigated at the cell level using constant current– constant voltage (CCCV) charging, it is impractical at the pack level in large-scale systems. However, battery management systems and inverter controls can emulate this effect by tapering charging power at high state-of-charge (SOC) levels, trading off charging speed for improved efficiency and reduced thermal stress. Ignoring this behavior in planning models can lead to undersized batteries and potential reliability issues. This paper proposes a tractable and scalable approach to approximate CCCV behavior using SOC-dependent tapered charging power (TCP) constraints. A MATLAB-based proof of concept demonstrates the energy delivery and efficiency benefits of tapering. The method is integrated into a long-term planning framework and evaluated under a synthetic load and solar profile. Results show tapering significantly affects BESS sizing, cost, and reliability under dynamic operating conditions that demand fast charging. These findings highlight tapering as a critical modeling factor for accurately capturing BESS performance in long-term microgrid planning."

Data from 91 matches of the 2024 Super Rugby Pacific, provided by Stats Perform, were analyzed. The dependent variable was defined as the points difference, and 26 independent variables were selected: 11 attacking indicators, 5 defensive indicators, 3 penalty-related indicators, 4 set-piece indicators, and 3 other indicators. Two machine learning algorithms, Random Forest and XGBoost, were employed to identify the key PIs affecting match outcomes.The results demonstrated that in both the Random Forest and XGBoost models, more than eight out of the top ten variables were offensive performance indicators. Specifically, higher values of LineBreaks, MetresGained, DefendersBeaten, and PostContactMetres and lower values of TurnoverConceded and MissedTackles were shown to be associated with maximizing match outcomes. Furthermore, the use of Shiny, a package of the statistical software R, enabled the development of more accessible and interpretable data visualizations. In conclusion, leveraging tools such as Shiny to strengthen and continuously monitor these performance indicators may hold substantial potential for enhancing the overall performance and success of rugby teams."

    "abstract": "The ubiquity of the Internet of Things (IoT) has unlocked the potential for recommender systems to become truly context-aware, moving beyond historical preferences to understand a user's immediate, dynamic situation. However, a primary challenge remains: dynamic context modeling—specifically, the acquisition, representation, and fusion of multimodal data streams generated by IoT sensors. While direct research into multimodal data fusion for IoT-based Context-Aware Recommender Systems CARS is still nascent, a wealth of established techniques exists in adjacent “smart systems” domains such as healthcare, activity monitoring, and smart manufacturing. This review article bridges this critical gap. We first establish a taxonomy of multimodal context relevant to recommendations, sourcing data from environmental, physiological, and kinematic IoT sensors. We then review data fusion architectures—from early and late fusion to modern hybrid approaches such as attention mechanisms and graph-based models—drawing on concrete examples from established literature in smart health, activity recognition, and industrial IoT. Finally, we synthesize these findings to propose a structured roadmap for Multimodal IoTbased CARS. This work culminates in a conceptual framework that maps established fusion techniques to recommendation tasks and outlines a research agenda to address key future challenges, including privacy and real-time performance."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Fault simulation and emulation are essential techniques for evaluating the dependability of integrated circuits, enabling early-stage vulnerability analysis and supporting the implementation of effective mitigation strategies. High-level hardware description languages such as Chisel facilitate the rapid development of complex fault scenarios with minimal modification to the design. However, existing Chisel-based fault injection (FI) frameworks are limited by their coarse-grained, instruction-level controllability, which restricts the precision of fault modeling. This work introduces Nail, a Chisel-based open-source FI framework that overcomes these limitations by introducing statebased faults. This approach allows fault scenarios based on specific system states instead of just instruction-level triggers, removing the need for precise timing of fault activation. For greater controllability, Nail allows users to arbitrarily modify internal trigger states via software at runtime. To support this, Nail automatically generates a software interface, offering straightforward access to the instrumented design. This enables fine-tuning of fault parameters during active fault-injection campaigns, a feature particularly beneficial for FPGA emulation, where synthesis is time-consuming. Utilizing these features, Nail narrows the gap between the high speed of emulation-based FI frameworks, the usability of software-based approaches, and the controllability achieved in simulation. We demonstrate Nail’s state-based fault injection and software framework by modeling a faulty general-purpose register in a RISC-V processor. Although this might appear straightforward, it requires statedependent fault injection and was previously impossible without fundamental changes to the design. The approach was validated in both simulation and FPGA emulation, where the addition of Nail introduced less than $1 \\%$ resource overhead."

    "abstract": "In energy-constrained residential contexts, particularly following disasters such as hurricanes, effective load scheduling and comfort-aware energy management become critical, yet detailed appliance-level and aggregate load profile data may not always be available. This paper proposes a smart home energy management system (HEMS) that integrates an M<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</inf>/G/∞ queueing-based synthetic load model to address data unavailability, enabling criticality-aware appliance scheduling alongside a comfort-based smart thermostat. The proposed CACHE-EMS-QUENCH framework aims to maintain user-defined thermal comfort, mitigate the lack of actual load data, and prioritize critical loads under constrained energy conditions typical of post-disaster scenarios. The system employs an M<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</inf>/G/∞ queueing model to generate realistic synthetic load profiles.

The HVAC system employs band-based operation, significantly penalizing deviations from the comfort zone to enhance occupant comfort and safety while prioritizing other critical loads. The effectiveness of the proposed system is demonstrated via a case study of a residential setting in Puerto Rico over a 72-hour period, using a solar-plus-battery energy setup and quadratic binary optimization implemented in Julia’s JuMP framework. Simulation results confirm the system’s capability to replicate realistic load curves, efficiently allocate limited energy to critical appliances, manage HVAC operations effectively, and support overall residential energy resilience."

Although increasing the capacity of resources helps to develop resilience during emergencies, this study focuses on striking a cost-resilience trade-off. The method includes multiple resilience metrics to optimize investments for emergency scenarios. By incorporating Fixed and Mobile Battery Energy Storage Systems (FBESS and MBESS), the strategy ensures flexibility, making the microgrid both cost-effective and resilient. The performance of the strategy is tested at low, moderate, and high resilience levels, which translate to varied critical load coverage and solar availability levels. In association with this framework, a novel Marginal Cost of Resilience (MCR) analysis is introduced to quantify the cost versus the resiliency value of marginally distributed energy resources (DER) expansions. This process allows for the determination of the most cost-effective strategies for the sizing of DER to achieve specified resiliency targets. The results highlight the importance of the simultaneous evaluation of resilience and cost in microgrid planning, providing useful information to grid operators and planners."

    "abstract": "During and after extreme storm events, power outages and corresponding restoration delays create hardship among people in the affected region. While previous research has focused on predicting outages and restoration times, their integration with social vulnerability has been less studied. In this study, outage and restoration predictions were coupled with social vulnerability index (SoVI) to develop new composite vulnerability maps. Outages were predicted using a physics-based outage prediction model, and restoration times across different census blocks were estimated using agent-based modeling. SoVI was computed using principal component analysis which combined 24 socioeconomic and sociodemographic indicators derived from the available census data. The framework was implemented in the city of New London, Connecticut following Hurricane Sandy. The composite vulnerability helped to identify several vulnerability cases such as regions with high power vulnerability with less social capacities indicating the necessity for resilience improvements. This framework can be used to illustrate the spatial disparities in power outages and restoration delays in conjunction with socioeconomic disparities and can help inform equitable decision-making for approaches such as implementing grid hardening measures."

Ultimately, the purpose is to mitigate flood related threats experienced by communities such as Purok 5, Barangay San Cristobal, Calamba, Laguna. San Cristobal Flood Management System (SCFMS) is a multi-platform system that integrates Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques with data collected by LiDAR (light detection and ranging) sensor to track real-time water levels. Additionally, the data from LiDAR facilitates the visualization of flood-prone areas and the broadcast of announcements to strengthen readiness for future calamities. The system includes core features including news feed announcements, river-level visualization, weather forecasts and trends, flood hazard mapping, visualization for flood history, SOS feature, and alerts from SMS and app notifications. Agile methodology assists the developers in iterative development to ensure the project aligns with users’ needs. Through usability testing and feedback, the system was evaluated for its functionality, accessibility, usefulness, and swift communication. Results indicated that the platform effectively provides timely communication on awareness and response in times of calamities, addresses the delay in gathering information and decision making, and ultimately, improves preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery efforts in the community. The developers concluded that all objectives of the study were successfully achieved, and the system provided a reliable tool for proactive flood management and local decision-making."

    "abstract": "Time predictability is an increasing concern in functionally-rich mixed-criticality applications at the Edge, which often carry different timing requirements. Edge devices, in turn, are increasingly complex to sustain the increasing computational requirements, which hinders providing predictable performance without seriously affecting performance. One of the main threats to predictable performance is the impact of timing interference arising from contention in an increasing number of shared hardware resources. The impact of software to hardware mapping on performance is a well-studied topic, seeking optimal memory mappings to reduce average and worst-case performance, and, more recently, to control and limit timing interference. These methods normally focus on code and data placement, especially in relation to specific properties of the memory hierarchy, either architectural (e.g. heterogeneous memory modules) or obtained through partitioning techniques. In practice, however, these works build on a uniform memory hierarchy model, where the source of a memory request, namely, where a task accessing a given memory is eventually executed, is not directly relevant. In this work, we consider a large class of systems (e.g., TriCore families) where memory hierarchies are non-uniform, and access latency depends on the computing element issuing the request. In those architectures, the impact of code and data placement on timing interference cannot be addressed without considering architectural constraints and task locality. Through empirical exploration, we show that code, data, and locality collectively have a substantial impact on contention bounds, leading to a significantly expanded optimization space compared to approaches considering only code and data placement under the uniform memory assumption. Our results motivate the need for novel, efficient optimization approaches that integrate task mapping and architectural constraints to reduce timing interference."

This undergraduate research contributes to the broader understanding of renewable energy solutions, focusing on improving the resilience and reliability of power systems in rural settings. On the technical side, this study aims at designing a hybrid microgrid system to be initially deployed at remote locations and farmlands in the state of Pennsylvania. The primary focus of this study is the integration of solar panels as an alternative power source, ensuring continued electricity supply during service interruptions of the primary grid. The study includes an analytical approach for microgrid design and the configuration of solar panels and storage systems to meet the community’s energy needs. A seamless transition mechanism is proposed to switch between the primary power source and the secondary power source in the form of energy storage.The proposed topology is consisted of a series of photovoltaic generators (solar panels) connected to the load via power electronic interfacing. The sample system utilizes three DC/DC power converters connected to a full-bridge DC/AC inverter circuit via an energy storage device. The AC output signals are going through a filtering stage in order to smooth them out and get ride of unwanted ripples in the voltage and current at the receiving-end. In this research, three DC/DC power converters have been elected to achieve lower device stress ratio and due to their availability. Even though this work is still underway and is being implemented physically (prototype), primarily results from modeling and simulation are presented in a step-by-step fashion to support the proposed research. The findings from this study are promising thus far and we aim at implementing and using the designed microgrid at one of the local areas in Schuylkill County, PA."

    "abstract": "As the transition from traditional fossil fuels to inverter-based resources advances, grid operators are increasingly concerned about the reduction in power system inertia. A significant consequence of reduced inertia is the rapid and severe decline in power system frequency following a large disturbance. This can lead to grid instability, unnecessary activation of under-frequency load shedding (UFLS) relays, or even blackouts. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based control scheme for battery energy storage systems (BESS) to provide fast frequency control, stabilize the system, and prevent unnecessary UFLS relay operations. The proposed approach employs the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm, surrogate-gradient-based evolution strategy for continuous control of the BESS output. Parallel computing is employed to accelerate the training process. Detailed time-domain simulations on a modified IEEE 39-bus test system demonstrate that the proposed scheme can reliably support system frequency, prevent rapid frequency declines, and avoid unnecessary load shedding, improving overall system stability and reliability."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a Bayesian method to infer the occurrence of a three-phase line-to-ground fault, its location along the faulted line, and the short-circuit fault current, all using noisy synchrophasor measurements of nodal voltages and currents. Central to the proposed method is a linear, complex-valued circuit model representing the faulted power network that comprises the known pre-fault system admittance matrix and an unknown fault signature to be inferred. The linear model combined with a (complex-valued) Gaussian prior enables a conjugate family where the fault signature posterior can be computed in closed form. This offers significant computational savings over standard sampling-based inference that can require many simulations to arrive at the posterior distribution. The posterior distribution of the fault signature further reveals probability distributions of the fault location along the affected line and the short-circuit fault current that could have led to the observed synchrophasor measurements. We illustrate key features of the complex-valued circuit modelling approach and the effectiveness of the proposed Bayesian inference via numerical case studies involving three-bus and nine-bus test systems."

    "abstract": "Brain tumor segmentation is a critical step in medical image analysis, aiding in diagnosis, treatment planning, and outcome prediction. Accurate segmentation can significantly impact patient care, yet it remains a complex and demanding task due to heterogeneous nature of tumor structures and imaging modalities. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool in medical imaging, offering state-of-the-art performance in segmentation tasks. While numerous studies have introduced advanced models and achieved impressive results, the specific practical challenges encountered during basic implementations are often underreported. For beginners and researchers new to the field, understanding these foundational obstacles is essential for building robust and effective models. This reflective study addresses that gap by exploring the application of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for brain tumor segmentation using Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) dataset. The CNN model was trained with hyperparameters optimized through Bayesian optimization to improve performance. Rather than focusing solely on metrics, this work emphasizes the difficulties faced throughout the process, including data variability, class imbalance, and preprocessing sensitivity. The aim is to shed light on common yet underdiscussed issues and provide practical insights to help guide new researchers in the field of deep learning for medical image analysis."

However, the communication between continuously expanding IoT devices (network connected vehicles, traffic signals and charging stations etc.) in edge has led to blurred network boundaries and need strict communication protection. However, with the increasing of computing, storage and intelligent resources in edge creates an imbalance capacity which has not been accompanied with corresponding security architecture adjustment. Security transmission protocols like authentication or encryption for vehicle-road collaboration system still predominantly rely on Vehicular Public Key Infrastructure (VPKI), traditional Certificate Authority (CA) architectures for Web or static IoT scenarios deployed in MEC-VANET environment generates substantial communication overhead like periodic Certificate Revocation List (CRL) distribution across whole network. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a two-tier certificate service for VPKI environment based on edge proxy and devices mobility features modeling. The solution decentralizes partial CA functionalities to edge thereby enhancing network performance and security."

Existing detectors, such as YOLOv8, often fail to preserve fine-grained details for small objects during multi-scale feature fusion and lack sufficient multi-scale representation capabilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes HSM-YOLO, an enhanced YOLOv8 model for improved small object detection. We introduce two innovations: first, a High-level Screening Feature Pyramid Network (HS-FPN) that uses high-level semantic guidance to enhance low-level features, improving multi-scale fusion for small objects. Second, an Enhanced Multi-Scale feature learning C2f module (MSC2f) replaces standard C2f blocks in the backbone to boost multi-scale representation and optimize model efficiency. Experiments on the VisDrone2019 dataset show that HSM-YOLO significantly outperforms YOLOv8 and other advanced detectors, achieving a $25.8 \\%$ gain in overall mAP@.5:.95 and a $14.4 \\%$ gain in small object APs. This validates the effectiveness of HS-FPN and MSC2f and provides a robust solution for small object detection in complex scenes."

Yet limited work has been done on systematically modeling the impacts of weather parameters to quantify resilience. This study presents a framework using statistical and Bayesian learning approaches to quantitatively model the relationship between weather parameters and power system resilience metrics. By leveraging real-world publicly available outage and weather data, we identify key weather variables of wind speed, temperature, and precipitation influencing a particular region’s resilience metrics. A case study of Cook County, Illinois, and Miami-Dade County, Florida, reveals that these weather parameters are critical factors in resiliency analysis and risk assessment. Additionally, we find that these weather variables have combined effects when studied jointly compared to their effects in isolation. This framework provides valuable insights for understanding how weather events affect power distribution system performance, supporting decision-makers in developing more effective strategies for risk mitigation, resource allocation, and adaptation to changing climatic conditions."

    "abstract": "Biometric systems are essential in security, healthcare, and forensic applications, and they increasingly depend on large-scale databases containing biometric traits such as iris images for identification and verification. However, these databases typically suffer from a lack of comprehensive and semantically rich metadata, which limits their utility for advanced machine learning tasks, interpretability, and efficient data retrieval. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate meaningful, reliable, and context-sensitive metadata from iris images, thereby enhancing the value and usability of biometric data sets. We propose a novel processing pipeline that combines classical visual feature extraction techniques with textual embeddings derived from state-of-the-art pre-trained LLMs, including BERT, GPT, and LLaMA. By leveraging the multimodal nature of these embeddings, our approach enriches the iris image representations beyond raw pixel data, capturing nuanced image quality attributes, illumination conditions, occlusions, and other biometricrelevant factors. Experimental validation is performed on two widely used iris biometric datasets: CASIA-IrisThousand and UBIRIS. We demonstrate that integrating LLM-generated metadata with visual features leads to improved classification performance in subject identification tasks, compared to using visual features alone. The approach also facilitates semantic search and supports advanced analytics by providing interpretable metadata descriptors. Furthermore, our results reveal critical challenges such as domain adaptation of LLMs to specialized biometric imagery, efficient fusion of textual and visual modalities, and managing limited labeled data for supervised fine-tuning. These findings highlight important directions for future research aimed at automating the annotation and enhancement of biometric databases using large pretrained language models. Overall, the paper introduces a multimodal pipeline that fuses visual and textual embeddings for biometric data enrichment. Experimental results on CASIA-Iris and UBIRIS confirm the effectiveness of integrating LLMs into biometric recognition systems."

This paper introduces static analysis as an essential phase in automating vertical reuse. It applies data and control flow analyses combined with a Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver to trace signal paths from the top-level design to its submodules. Experimental validation demonstrates the applicability of the approach on the execution stage of a RISC-V processor. Its scalability and efficiency are further evaluated using a configurable benchmark with varying design sizes and hierarchy levels. The findings suggest that the static analysis provides sufficient information about interconnections and dependencies in the top-level design to determine connections necessary for automating the vertical reuse of PSS models."

The signals were transformed into the spectral domain using the Fast Fourier Transform, and relevant features were extracted as input for a Multilayer Perceptron. The model demonstrated stable behavior during training, with consistent loss and accuracy curves across both training and validation sets. An accuracy of 95.65 % was reached, with 100 % of specificity and 96 % of precision.

    "abstract": "Wireless Human-Machine Collaboration (WHMC) represents a critical advancement for Industry 5.0, enabling seamless interaction between humans and machines across geographically distributed systems. As the WHMC systems become increasingly important for achieving complex collaborative control tasks, ensuring their stability is essential for practical deployment and long-term operation. Stability analysis certifies how the closed-loop system will behave under model randomness, which is essential for systems operating with wireless communications. However, the fundamental stability analysis of the WHMC systems remains an unexplored challenge due to the intricate interplay between the stochastic nature of wireless communications, dynamic human operations, and the inherent complexities of control system dynamics. This paper establishes a fundamental WHMC model incorporating dual wireless loops for machine and human control. Our framework accounts for practical factors such as short-packet transmissions, fading channels, and advanced HARQ schemes. We model human control lag as a Markov process, which is crucial for capturing the stochastic nature of human interactions. Building on this model, we propose a stochastic cycle-cost-based approach to derive a stability condition for the WHMC system, expressed in terms of wireless channel statistics, human dynamics, and control parameters. Our findings are validated through extensive numerical simulations and a proof-of-concept experiment, where we developed and tested a novel wireless collaborative cart-pole control system. The results confirm the effectiveness of our approach and provide a robust framework for future research on WHMC systems in more complex environments."

    "abstract": "Video analytics plays a vital role in modern applications such as public safety and smart cities, yet transmitting high-resolution video over wireless networks is severely constrained by bandwidth and latency. Existing semantic communication approaches alleviate communication overhead by discarding irrelevant content, but they often impose prohibitive computational costs on resource-constrained surveillance devices. To overcome this limitation, we propose SenSem, a sensing-assisted semantic communication framework that uniquely leverages channel state information (CSI) to reduce both communication and computation overhead. SenSem first exploits location cues embedded in CSI to estimate the region of interest and crop frames before upload. On the cropped frames, a lightweight semantic evaluator scores blocks, and a joint block selection and transmit power control algorithm maximizes the analytics performance for multi-device uplink; at the edge, a sensing-assisted analytics network injects spatial cues to further boost inference. Extensive evaluations on the WARP platform demonstrate that SenSem consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior video analytics accuracy under strict latency constraints. By seamlessly reducing both transmission and device-side computation overhead, SenSem, offers a scalable and efficient solution for next-generation wireless video analytics systems."

    "abstract": "In recent years, object detection methods have achieved promising results in the field of wideband signal detection and recognition (WSDR). However, for resource-constrained airborne platforms and degraded electromagnetic environments, existing methods still face challenges such as high computational overhead and insufficient noise robustness. In this article, we propose a lightweight cascade network based on YOLO (LC-YOLO) and apply it to tackle the WSDR challenge under complex electromagnetic environments or resource-constrained scenarios. Specifically, we design a lightweight hybrid attention enhancement module (HAEM), which is constructed by channel attention (CA), pixel attention (PA), and mixed-shape separable convolution groups. It is cascaded at the front of the backbone network to enhance the representation ability of targets in images. To further improve the network's detection performance for targets with extreme aspect ratios, we propose a feature extraction module for optimizing the backbone network, named cross stage partial with strip module (C2SM). This module inherits the gradient shunting advantage of the efficient layer aggregation network (ELAN) and integrates the receptive field characteristics of large strip convolution, significantly improving the detection accuracy of slender signal targets while reducing the number of parameters. Furthermore, we reveal that the coordinate discretization in distribution focused loss (DFL) limits complete boundary regression for slender targets, and propose an enhanced approach integrating coordinate continuous regression with Smooth L1 Loss. Experimental results show that the N, S, and M configurations of LC-YOLO outperform the current mainstream lightweight state-of-the-art (SOTA) object detection methods on the WidebandSig53 dataset (WBSig53). The smallest configuration, LC-YOLO-N, outperforms the baseline model YOLOv8-N by 3.9% in mAP, while maintaining only 2.5 M parameters and an inference speed of 113 FPS."

While the optimal controller in a standard linear-quadratic Gaussian (LQG) setup can be computed analytically, determining the optimal times to transmit sensor data remains computationally and analytically challenging. We show that, through reformulation and the introduction of auxiliary binary variables, the scheduling problem can be cast as a computationally efficient mixed-integer linear program (MILP). This formulation not only simplifies the analysis but also reveals structural insights and provides clear decision criterion at each step. Embedding the approach within a model predictive control ( MPC) framework enables dynamic adaptation, and we prove that the resulting scheduler performs at least as well as any deterministic strategy (e.g., periodic strategy). Simulation results further demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms traditional periodic scheduling."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Existing multimodal point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) methods usually integrate 3D and 2D information to simulate human visual perception of distortions. However, due to the lack of consideration of spatial correspondence, they have difficulty to learn consistent distortion representations from different modalities in the same region of the PC. In addition, they also ignore the heterogeneity of modalities and rely on complex fusion mechanisms (e.g., attention) to integrate multimodal features. Both lead to limited performance and increased computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a novel double alignment multimodal learning network (DA-Net), which introduces two key alignment strategies. Specifically, the first is spatial pre-alignment strategy, which generates informative 2D patch for each 3D patch via an adaptive patch projection module (APPM), ensuring accurate spatial correspondence of different modalities prior to feature extraction. The second is a uniform feature alignment strategy, which includes feature disentanglement module (FDM) and feature mapping module (FMM) to relieve heterogeneity of modalities and guide the optimization of 2D and 3D encoder. Finally, multimodal features are simply integrated and regressed to obtain the quality score. Experimental results demonstrate that the DA-Net exhibits outstanding performance and generalization ability. It also achieves lower computational complexity compared with other multimodal PCQA methods. The source codes of DA-Net will be available at https://github.com/Rphone/DA-Net."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to develop an automated entity matching system for linking a research institute’s employees with their PubMed publications, reducing reliance on manual processes. Such entity matching is critical for research productivity review and collaboration fostering. The corpus comprised 121,447 employees and 75,546 PubMed publications (2012-2023) from a quaternary care pediatric hospital. We developed and evaluated three models: a Random Forest (RF) model, an ad-hoc rule-based model, and a hybrid approach combining both. Features included author name, affiliation, and medical subject headings (MeSH) terms. The RF and hybrid models were robust in handling incomplete or missing data by leveraging MeSH terms that were not included in the rule-based model due to data complexity. The open researcher and contributor identifiers (ORCIDs) served as the reference standard for the entity matching. Evaluation metrics include F1-score, precision, and recall. The F1-score of the rule-based model was 0.95 (95% C.I., 0.94-0.97); of the RF model, 0.98 (95% C.I., 0.97-0.99) [P<0.05, rule-based as the reference model]. The precision of the rules-based model was 1; of the RF model, 0.97 (95% C.I., 0.95-0.98), [P<0.05, rule-based as the reference model]. The recall of the rules-based model was 0.91 (95% C.I., 0.88-0.95); of the RF model, 0.99 (95% C.I., 0.98-1), [P<0.05, rule-based as the reference model]. The hybrid model had the same performance as the RF model. This retrospective study demonstrates that machine learning models incorporating MeSH terms and effective missing data handling improved entity matching performance in linking researchers with their publications."

    "abstract": "Prognostic health management (PHM) of microsystems is of great importance in the forward design of reliability. Piezoresistive stress sensors are gaining increasing attention in PHM research. In order to measure stress in specific directions, a stress sensor with near-zero transverse sensitivity is proposed in this work. The stress sensor is based on a Wheatstone bridge consisting of different sensing units. It is found that the magnitude of stress transferred to the sensing unit is not the same as the stress applied to the sensor chip. This affects the sensitivities of the sensing units. The transverse sensitivity is reduced to nearly zero by optimizing the geometry parameters of the sensing units while taking into account the stress transfer coefficients derived in this work. The experimental results show that the longitudinal sensitivity coefficient of the optimized stress sensor is 0.092 mV/MPa, and the longitudinal to transverse sensitivity ratio in absolute value is 168. The proposed stress sensor has excellent uniaxial response characteristics. These advantages indicate that the proposed sensor has potential applications in PHM-oriented microsystem research."

    "abstract": "Lightweight cryptography (LWC) has become increasingly critical for ensuring secure communication in energy-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Memristor-based architecture provides a promising approach for secure communication in energy-sensitive and hardware-constrained applications. Piccolo is a lightweight encryption algorithm that offers high security while enabling compact hardware implementation. In addition, Piccolo is specifically designed to operate efficiently in resource-limited environments, making it a strong candidate for low-energy applications such as IoT devices. However, earlier implementations of the Piccolo algorithm on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platforms, CMOS, and hybrid memristor-CMOS (MeMOS) technology have faced challenges with high power consumption, hardware overhead, and limited scalability. This article presents a novel architecture for implementing the Piccolo-80 encryption algorithm using the voltage-to-memristance (VTM) approach, in which the design maps Piccolo’s primary operations onto VTM stateful logic gates. This enhances performance, reduces switching activity, and leverages the nonvolatile properties of memristors. The proposed design introduces VTM-based memristor logic gates that significantly reduce hardware complexity and power consumption compared with previous implementations. The results from comparing CMOS and hybrid MeMOS implementations in terms of area and energy consumption demonstrate that hardware implementation of Piccolo’s lightweight algorithm using the VTM approach not only improves energy efficiency but also enables the design of optimized, low-power circuits. The design achieves a power consumption of 17.4 mW at 1.8 V and 133 MHz, with only 1214 gate equivalents (GEs), reducing power by up to 32% and area by nearly 20% compared with state-of-the-art hybrid MeMOS designs."

    "abstract": "The microalga Nannochloropsis oculata was cultivated under controlled laboratory conditions, but cost and time constraints limited the number of experimental replicates to only 17. Previous studies have demonstrated the value of synthetic data generation in domains with limited experimental access, including biomedical research, water resource modeling, and genomics. However, applications in microalgal biotechnology remain scarce, despite the high cost and complexity of empirical trials in this field. To overcome this limitation, synthetic data generation methods based on artificial intelligence were used to simulate additional experimental conditions and expand the dataset 100-fold, resulting in 1700 synthetic samples. Three generative approaches were evaluated: variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and copula-based models. The quality of the synthetic data was evaluated by comparing it to the original experimental dataset using statistical divergence measures and the predictive performance of Random Forest models trained to estimate biomass and lipid content. The variational autoencoder method achieved the highest similarity to the original dataset, yielding the lowest divergence score and predictive error in biomass and lipid content. While this study focuses on a single real-world dataset, the proposed approach could be extended to other biological contexts where data scarcity is a limiting factor. These findings suggest that artificial intelligence techniques can effectively augment small-scale biological datasets, providing a valuable strategy to enhance experimentation and analysis in resource-limited conditions."

    "abstract": "Understanding brain dynamics is important for neuroscience and mental health. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables the measurement of neural activities through blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which represent brain states. In this study, we aim to predict future human resting brain states with fMRI. Due to the 3D voxel-wise spatial organization and temporal dependencies of the fMRI data, we propose a novel architecture which employs a 4D Shifted Window (Swin) Transformer as encoder to efficiently learn spatio-temporal information and a convolutional decoder to enable brain state prediction at the same spatial and temporal resolution as the input fMRI data. We used 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for model training and testing. Our novel model has shown high accuracy when predicting 7.2s resting-state brain activities based on the prior 23.04s fMRI time series. The predicted brain states highly resemble BOLD contrast and dynamics. This work shows promising evidence that the spatiotemporal organization of the human brain can be learned by a Swin Transformer model, at high resolution, which provides a potential for reducing the fMRI scan time and the development of brain-computer interfaces in the future."

    "abstract": "The low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite megaconstellation can provide ubiquitous coverage and high-performance connectivity, supporting multi-slice applications with various key performance indicator (KPI) requirements. However, due to the dynamic nature of LEO satellites, limited resources, and the diverse demands of different slices, managing user association (UA) and resource allocation becomes an increasingly challenging task in areas with overlapping satellite coverage. This paper proposes a joint optimization model for UA and resource allocation in satellite networks (SLSNs). Based on mixed-integer non-linear programming (MILP), our model minimizes the total propagation delay and optimizes the demand satisfaction ratio (DSR) using a Max-Min approach to ensure each slice meets its unique throughput requirements. In addition, a visibility-aware component is incorporated to prioritize longer satellite visibility, reduce handovers, and improve network stability. Due to the computational complexity of the MILP model, we propose a heuristic-based balanced association with delay-aware bandwidth distribution (B-DAD) approach. B-DAD operates in two phases: the initial UA phase selects satellites based on a combined metric of delay, load, and visibility duration, while the residual bandwidth distribution phase reallocates unused bandwidth among associated users proportionally. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve DSR, propagation delays, transmission delays, and network stability compared to the widely adopted benchmark maximum sum of data rate (Max-SR) and Greedy methods under varying elevation angles. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of the MILP model in achieving optimal solutions and the efficiency of B-DAD as a scalable alternative for large-scale scenarios."

    "abstract": "Cloud computing has emerged as an important foundation for high-scale artificial intelligence (AI) computations, offering the storage, scale, and GPU-accelerated resources required to train and fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, the use of spot instances while cost effective poses substantial preemption risks, which can interrupt training and cause loss of computational progress. Legacy checkpointing methods that save the entire model are inefficient because of their high I/O overhead and slow recovery times, and storage at high costs. This paper introduces a Spot-Energy-Aware Adapter Layer Incremental Checkpointing Framework that selectively stores only adapter layer parameters and delta updates, with smaller, faster, and more efficient checkpoints. The framework coalesces predictive checkpoint scheduling and hybrid cloud deployment with both spot and on-demand instances to improve fault tolerance and cost savviness. Experimental results show that the proposed framework saves checkpoint storage, recovery time by 40%, and total training be less expensive compared to traditional full model checkpointing techniques. The findings validate the design’s capability to ensure high training continuity while optimizing performance and cost in preemptible cloud environments."

    "abstract": "The Fit4MedRob initiative (“Fit for Medical Robotics”) is a large-scale, multi-partner project funded by the Italian Ministry of University and Research under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP). It involves 25 partners, including research institutions, clinical centers, and industrial companies, with the goal of integrating advanced robotic technologies into rehabilitation and assistive care. Within this initiative, Mission 2 - Activity 5 (Match Making #53) specifically targets the development and validation of a robotic protocol for the rehabilitation of post-stroke hemispatial inattention (HI), a disabling condition characterized by the inability to perceive and/or attend to one side of the peripersonal space. This paper presents the design and preliminary evaluation of a modular robotic system based on the TIAGo platform, a collaborative mobile manipulator developed by PAL Robotics. The architecture integrates five key modules: navigation, patient identification, interaction, therapy delivery, and response evaluation. A series of preliminary tests were conducted with healthy participants to validate core components of the system, including autonomous navigation accuracy, real-time face recognition based on ROS4HRI (Robot Operating System for Human-Robot Interaction), and head pose estimation exploiting the MediaPipe library, validated against a ground truth provided by stereophotogrammetric measures. Results confirm the feasibility of the proposed system and support its future application in clinical trials."

    "abstract": "The escalating demand for energy-efficient embedded systems necessitates innovative approaches to mitigate dynamic power consumption in general-purpose cores. This paper introduces a threshold-based, workload-adaptive clockgating technique for a dual-issue RISC-V core, dynamically disabling the underutilized second-issue datapath to reduce dynamic power consumption. The method employs a threshold-based clock-gating controller that dynamically activates the secondissue pipeline according to the target workload and desired energy/performance trade-offs. By integrating latch- and flip-flop-based clock-gating mechanisms into the open-source VeeR EH1 dual-issue core, coarse-grained control over the secondissue pipeline is achieved, enhancing energy efficiency with minimal impact on computing performance. For prototyping and evaluation, an FPGA implementation targeting AMD/Xilinx FPGA devices, along with CoreMark benchmark evaluation, has been conducted, demonstrating 5% improvement in energy efficiency and a dynamic power savings of up to 15%, making the approach particularly suitable for power-constrained embedded systems."

    "abstract": "As a cyber-physical system, Industrial Control Systems (ICS) involve operators strictly following operational specifications and controllers executing automated control programs. This makes anomaly based detection techniques particularly suitable for intrusion detection in ICS. However, operational specifications, which contain a large amount of domain-specific knowledge in natural language text, suffer from challenges such as difficulties in knowledge extraction, ambiguity, and incomplete information. Meanwhile, extracting control behavior rules from operational specifications often relies on manual extraction, leading to low accuracy and efficiency. This paper proposes an automated rule extraction method based on Large Language Models (LLMs). We construct a domain-specific knowledge base to systematically improve terminology precision in prompt engineering. Building on this foundation, the framework employs Chain of Thought (CoT) techniques to guide the LLM through hierarchical rule extraction: initially recognizing single devices, then building system topology, and finally extracting control behavior rules. The proposed method is validated through its application to the thermal power plant simulation platform, demonstrating its effectiveness in extracting control behavior rules from operational specifications."

    "abstract": "This paper systematically reviews the current research status of satellite internet security in dynamic task scheduling scenarios, focusing on three key directions: edge intelligence and cloud-edge collaborative computing, blockchain trust mechanisms, and digital watermarking technology. The aim is to systematically summarize the research progress in heterogeneous resource management, security collaboration, and trusted data transmission. In terms of edge computing, a model migration strategy driven by hybrid quantum reinforcement learning and orbit prediction is integrated to achieve adaptive support for dynamic satelliteground services. In terms of trust mechanisms, a lightweight blockchain architecture combined with a federated learning framework provides decentralized support for data consistency and trusted communication under highly dynamic topologies. In terms of content security, the use of frequency-spatial domain fusion watermarking and reinforcement learningdriven offloading strategies effectively achieves data embedding and traceability. However, these technologies still face real-time and stability challenges in low-orbit satellite links with frequency variations and high latency. Looking ahead, AIGC and cognitive security will become key to building a self-evolving security system. Through generative content modeling and attack graph reasoning, intelligent evolution of security mechanisms can be achieved. This paper provides a theoretical foundation and research guidance for building a cross-level, dynamically adaptable satellite internet security architecture."

The system is powered by a Fuzzy-based Weighted Federated Machine Learning (FWFML) method: models are trained locally on user consumption data, combined securely at the edge/cloud, and reweighted with fuzzy logic to account for diverse usage patterns. A built-in review loop analyzes outcomes and fine-tunes management plans over time. In experiments, the framework achieved 98.5% prediction accuracy with a 1.5% miss rate, indicating robust performance. We also outline key challenges for future work including coping with non-stationary demand, communication and privacy constraints, and fairness across heterogeneous users to further strengthen efficiency, resilience, and sustainability in modern energy systems."

A data independent phase tracking compensation phase detector (PTCPD) is introduced to enhance jitter tolerance (JTOL). It mitigates the shortcomings of conventional bang-bang phase detector (BBPD) and reduces loop latency. The proposed PTCPD removes the retiming circuit and generates a continuously varying, unidirectional adjustment signal. This compensates the \"no action\" problem of conventional BBPD by using the input data sampling the recovered clock. In order to transmit the PAM-4 signal, this paper presents a threshold voltage adaptive system. This system adapts the reference levels of the PAM-4 signal. The proposed CDR is fabricated by TSMC 40 nm (TN40G) 1P10M CMOS process with 0.9 V supply voltage and the data rate is 20 Gb/s PAM-4 signal. The recovered clock is 5.0 GHz.

The method exploits the shared oscillatory modes in multi-channel PMU data and uses Prony decomposition to isolate and remove oscillations, accompanied by a weighted linear fit, to identify the underlying trend. A new metric, the Spectral Misallocation Score (SMS), is introduced to quantify trend estimation accuracy by evaluating spectral leakage between trend and residual signals. The proposed method is evaluated on a two-area model under both well-damped and lightly damped conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that STEP outperforms benchmark methods, including exponential smoothing, Savitzky–Golay, low-pass, and trend filtering, in terms of accuracy and robustness. STEP also meets real-time computation requirements. Its effectiveness and efficiency make it suitable for integration into wide-area control applications."

This paper presents a new principle and verifies it on a four-quadrant multiplier on a test chip in 65 nm CMOS technology. A new type of input predistortion is used to drive the cascaded differential stage.

This study addresses this issue by proposing an accessibility-based E-Government Portals Best Practices Model (E-GPBPM). The research begins by establishing a comparative analysis of the three most cited accessibility guidelines in the literature: WCAG, Section 508, and E-MAG. As WCAG 2.0 is the most established and comprehensive standard, it was selected for further analysis. Subsequently, a mapping study was conducted to investigate the extent to which the existing E-GPBPM covers the WCAG 2.0 accessibility guideline. This involved a detailed mapping of the model's best practices against the WCAG 2.0 success criteria. The results show that the WCAG criteria comprehensively align with the E-GPBPM's specific goals and practices within the web content category. Finally, an accessibility-based version of the EGPBPM is proposed to foster inclusive access to digital public services."

The system employs a custom-designed wristband that integrates a high SNR analog front-end, a 24-bit ADC, and an ESP32-S3 microcontroller capable of executing quantized neural network inference in real time. A lightweight 1D convolutional neural network with residual blocks is developed and deployed on-device to classify six common hand gestures. To support data acquisition and model management, a PyQt-based graphical user interface is also implemented. Experimental results with five participants demonstrate that the proposed system achieves over 95% classification accuracy with an average inference latency of 35 ms. The findings confirm that our developed wristband can effectively support real-time gesture recognition on wearable and assistive platforms."

    "abstract": "Data poisoning attacks, which subtly corrupt training data, pose a significant risk to medical image classification, potentially leading to severe diagnostic errors. Existing defenses often rely on full access to training datasets and manual sanitization, which are inefficient and inadequate for complex medical images, particularly when the poisoning is minimal. To tackle this, we propose an Explainable AI (XAI)-based approach using Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to detect poisoning in ResNet-101 models trained on chest X-rays with healthy and pneumonia subjects. Specifically, LRP outcomes provide justifications for how the ResNet-101 model classifies certain images as pneumonia. Illogical justifications from LRP outcomes, along with inconsistencies between decisions and justifications, can indicate the presence of poisoned data in the trained models. By analyzing LRP-generated heatmaps and extracted features (e.g., SIFT, HOG), we train a classifier to distinguish between models trained on clean and poisoned data. Our method achieves an AUC of 0.86 even with a small amount of poisoned data, requiring no access to the training dataset. Using only a few test input images, it demonstrates the potential of explainability-driven features in identifying poisoned models."

Both designs deliver a 400 mV output, operating in the weak inversion region to significantly minimize power consumption. A bulk-driven input approach is employed to enhance the input common-mode range (ICMR) for stable operation. The TO-based LDO achieves 23.4 mV/V line sensitivity, 33 µs Transient Response (TR), 21.5 nA quiescent current, and 11.0 µm × 30.8 µm area, demonstrating fast dynamic response and efficient regulation within a small footprint. In contrast, the FC-based LDO reduces the quiescent current to 7.3 nA with 31.8 mV/V line sensitivity, 1.9 ms TR, and 11.9 µm × 131.4 µm area, favoring applications where static power is prioritized over transient speed. These designs demonstrate an optimal balance between area, power, and regulation performance, making them highly suitable for biosensor and implantable device applications."

A key challenge is data heterogeneity among clients, which often leads to reduced performance and unstable convergence. In this work we investigate Federated Feature Distillation (FedFed), an approach that allows clients to share only performance-sensitive features while keeping privacy-preserving features local. We evaluated FedFed on multiple datasets: FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, Arabic Handwritten Characters, and CIFAR10MNIST. Our experiments show improved model accuracy and reduced loss when comparing FedFed with traditional aggregation methods (FedAvg and FedNova). On FashionMNIST, the optimized models reached 93.09% with FedAvg and 93.36% with FedNova, while FedFed further enhanced stability and convergence under heterogeneity. Alongside algorithmic advances, code optimization and hyperparameter tuning improved reproducibility, efficiency, and overall accuracy. The paper concludes with insights on convergence, communication trade-offs, and future directions toward stronger privacy guarantees and scalable real-world deployment."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an overview of structural complexity metrics of directed graphs adapted for workflow nets (WFN), a subclass of Petri nets, to evaluate the simplicity of models built by discovery methods. The metrics are used to compare the simplicity of two or more nets built from the same event log. Four metrics, referred to as volume, density, cyclomatic measure, and coefficient of complexity, are presented, which are adapted to evaluate bipartite digraphs. Then these measures are applied to a set of pairs of different models; each net of a pair replays the same event log with perfect fitness. The relationship between the model's complexity and language is analysed."

A hardware-efficient approximation of the Robert’s Cross operator forms the core of the design, which can be scaled for different image resolutions and used as a building block for biomedical engineering concepts. The proposed edge detector consumes only 19 nW per pixel, achieves an average PSNR of 26.9 dB and SSIM of 0.84, and supports high computational throughput of 190000 fps. Robustness is verified through Monte Carlo simulations, process variation analysis, and corner-case testing. Comparative results with software-based edge detectors confirm the design’s accuracy and reliability. The simulations are performed using Cadence IC Suite in a 65 nm CMOS process, demonstrating its suitability for low-power, high-speed image processing applications."

Simulation-based verification is the industry standard to verify the functionality of a design, but it lacks exhaustive coverage. On the other hand, formal verification provides exhaustive verification, but with scalability and convergence limitations. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a unified hybrid methodology that combines the advantages of both. A block classification framework is proposed to allocate formal or simulation techniques based on design complexity and criticality, embedding formal tools within simulation environments. By using Synopsys VC Formal, the proposed methodology achieved coverage closure time reduction by more than 50%, eliminated recurring top-level connectivity bugs, and improved bug detection latency by 47% on average compared to a simulation-only approach."

    "abstract": "Current heterogeneous systems integrate generalpurpose Central Processing Units (CPUs), Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), and Neural Processing Units (NPUs). The efficient use of such systems requires a significant programming effort to distribute computation and synchronize across devices, which usually involves using Atomic Memory Operations (AMOs). Arm recently launched a floating-point Atomic Memory Operations (FAMOs) extension to perform atomic updates on floating-point data types specifically. This work characterizes and models heterogeneous architectures to understand how floating-point AMOs impact graph, Machine Learning (ML), and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads. Our analysis shows that many AMOs are performed on floating-point data, which modern systems execute using inefficient compare-and-swap (CAS) constructs. Therefore, replacing CASbased constructs with FAMOs can improve a wide range of workloads. Moreover, we analyze the trade-offs of executing FAMOs at different memory hierarchy levels, either in private caches (near) or remotely in shared caches (far). We have extended the widely used AMBA CHI protocol to evaluate such FAMO support on a simulated chiplet-based heterogeneous architecture. While near FAMOs achieve an average $1.34 \\times$ speed-up, far FAMOs reach an average $1.58 \\times$ speed-up. We conclude that FAMOs can bridge the gap between CPU architecture and accelerators and enabling synchronization in key application domains."

Using data from the World Health Organization's Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS), we classified the population into three distinct profiles: current smokers, ex-smokers, and nonsmokers. The analysis highlights key demographic and occupational characteristics that shape smoking behavior and cessation outcomes. Logistic regression was applied to determine the predictors of successful quitting, with the ex-smoker status used as an indicator of cessation success. Results revealed that factors such as age, gender, education level, residence, and work environment significantly influence the likelihood of quitting. These findings provide actionable insights for public health stakeholders and underline the necessity of designing targeted behavior change interventions to support vulnerable populations in their efforts to quit tobacco and reduce smoking-related health disparities in the EMR."

This work presents a comparative study of SET susceptibility across prominent dynamic comparator architectures, including the StrongArm latch and Double-Tail structures, with emphasis on the effectiveness of the Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) mitigation technique. To further improve radiation resilience, we propose a Radiation-Hardened-by-Design (RHBD) dynamic comparator based on a modified StrongArm architecture, termed the StrongArm Quatro-Latch comparator. The proposed design incorporates structural enhancements aimed at suppressing SET-induced disruptions. Circuit-level simulations demonstrate that the Quatro-Latch architecture significantly improves SET tolerance while maintaining competitive performance in terms of speed, power, and area. Comparative analysis across all architectures provides insight into trade-offs between SET robustness and design metrics, confirming the proposed RHBD comparator as a compelling solution for dynamic comparator-based ADCs operating in radiation-prone environments."

The accurate measurement can be used to determine and optimize the current operating performance of the AGD and offers to further enhance efficiency or electromagnetic emissions (EME) of the switch mode converter using the system. However, achieving the required high conversion rate poses a challenge in the technology node required for the power circuitry. To solve this, the unique properties of the signals of interest are exploited. Specifically, the transition window which has to be converted occurs in a short time frame and can be fully captured in 32 samples. Thus, a non-uniform sampling scheme is proposed where sampling is done in an interleaved stage during a short burst while digitization occurs subsequently in a single quantizer circuit, allowing the use of quantizer architectures not normally associated with high-speed designs."

    "abstract": "Robot systems are facing a growing demand for realtime performance of multiple computing tasks and autonomous decision-making. However, limited computing resources make efficient scheduling of computing tasks and optimizing resource utilization a key challenge. Virtualization of field-programmable gate arrays enables the dynamic sharing of hardware resources, while dynamic partial reconfiguration allows for flexible adjustment of hardware accelerators based on task requirements, making it suitable for complex and fluctuating computing loads. However, virtualization scheduling based on operating systems or microkernels usually introduces high software overhead. This paper proposes a hardware-level adaptive scheduling mechanism integrated with spatiotemporal scheduling to efficiently share reconfigurable computing resources among multiple users. This mechanism is transparent to users and can adaptively adjust the spatiotemporal allocation strategy according to the characteristics of tasks. In addition, the scheduling scheme introduces access rights management to strictly prevent unauthorized resource access. Hardware scheduling system achieves a speedup of over $1000 \\times$ compared to a software-based scheduling system when executing 100 hardware tasks, reducing execution time from seconds to milliseconds."

This digital tool offers a lower-resource and more efficient alternative to manual analysis. The model was validated against Philippine Rice Research Institute standards, demonstrating high object detection accuracy (F1: 0.89; mAP50: 0.8393) and exceptional application measurement capabilities (length: 99.72%; width: 99.65%). User feedback confirmed strong acceptance and significant analysis time reduction. By providing rapid, accurate grain dimension measurements, this mobile application substantially enhances the efficiency of rice breeding programs. This streamlined assessment also minimizes yield losses, optimizes resource use, and indirectly lowers the carbon intensity per unit of grain produced in the Philippine context."

On the other hand, as power system maintains its public goods character, the investment of a commonly used installation/service is made on the voluntary base. Such investments are the result of a group of agents’ willingness to join their forces to make a common attempt, but there exists the danger of an agent increasing his/her payoff by avoiding any contribution and to free-ride on the contributions of others. The standard public goods game (PGG) method, used to analyze the phenomenon, is unable to reduce free-riding. In the paper, PGG is suitably adapted to mitigate this selfish behavior of free-riding agents. The problem is founded on a system-based perspective and is realized by modifying the PGG model by introducing a suitable correction term in the payoff equation. A new payoff profile, now much favorable for the participated agents is proposed based on a pair of crucial parameters. Both parameters are arbitrarily selected to offer a balancing PGG operation by rewarding the contributed participants and punishing the free-riding ones. The punished and rewarded level is decided by a neutral operator, is hidden from the agents and is capable to reduce or eliminate or even inverse the impact of selfish behavior. Extended simulation results fully confirm the excellent balancing PGG performance."

    "abstract": "Multifactorial optimization (MFO) has gained increasing attention in evolutionary multitasking (EMT), as it enables implicit knowledge transfer among tasks to enhance overall optimization efficiency. However, selecting appropriate transfer methods and adjusting their transfer probabilities remain significant challenges in MFO. Since existing selection and adjustment rules are typically formulated based on classical logic, they often fail to effectively handle the inherent uncertainty and dynamic nature of EMT. To address these limitations, this paper suggests a new multifactorial evolutionary algorithm based on fuzzy logic, called MFEA-FL. By employing the Mamdani fuzzy inference system (FIS), expert knowledge can be naturally incorporated into the decision-making process, enabling MFEA-FL to exhibit strong fault tolerance and robustness across a wide range of multitasking environments. Specifically, two strategies, namely fuzzy transfer method selection (FTMS) and fuzzy transfer probability adjustment (FTPA), are proposed. FTMS quantifies the applicability of candidate transfer methods via a Mamdani FIS and then adaptively selects the most promising one for conducting knowledge transfer. Meanwhile, FTPA estimates the change of the transfer probability via a Mamdani FIS and dynamically adjusts the intensity of knowledge transfer. Experimental results on a series of multitasking optimization problems validate the effectiveness of the two fuzzy strategies and the superior performance of MFEA-FL over existing state-of-the-art EMT algorithms."

While fiber optic temperature sensors (FOTS) offer multiple advantages, achieving a synergistic combination of cost-effectiveness, compact dimensions, and high integration remains a critical challenge for practical implementations. This work presents an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven solution featuring a miniaturized, cost efficient fiber-optic leaky-mode temperature speckle sensor with integrated optoelectronic transceiver functionality. The system employs a fiber microsphere at the emission end for light source coupling and collection, while a fiber taper at the detection end facilitates modal leakage from the fiber core. Temperature sensitive material integrated within the sensing region modulates the refractive index (RI) in response to environmental temperature variations, thereby altering the specklegram characteristics of the leaked modes. A convolutional vision transformer (ConViT)-based regression model was trained to establish quantitative mapping between speckle image features and temperature measurements. Comparative analysis demonstrated superior performance against convolutional neural network (CNN), vision transformer (Vit), and modified CNN architectures, achieving a median absolute error (MedAE) of 0.256 °C. This integrated approach effectively addresses the critical triad of cost reduction, miniaturization, and functional integration, potentially advancing the development of fiber-optic thermometry."

This study introduces the multispectral ship wake data set, the first data set of its kind to combine MS imagery with annotated ship attributes, including identity, size, and velocity derived from automatic identification system data. Then, several different architectures are presented, fine-tuned, and benchmarked on the developed data set. The detection analysis is performed on four spectral bands, i.e., B2 (blue), B3 (green), B4 (red), and B8 (near-infrared). These bands are selected due to their spatial resolution, which is the highest available for Sentinel-2 data. Results demonstrate that tailored approaches achieve up to 8% missed detections and below 2% false positives, significantly advancing maritime surveillance by enabling precise wake detection. These improvements facilitate enhanced operational capabilities, such as the identification of dark vessels and bolstering maritime security in real-world scenarios."

    "abstract": "Soil surfaces often exhibit moisture stratification as a result of natural processes such as precipitation and vertical infiltration, which is however commonly neglected in traditional L-band soil scattering modeling and inversion works. Understanding how different moisture stratifications affect microwave observations is therefore of critical importance. Existing soil scattering simulation algorithms face challenges in accurately modeling layered soils, especially when large lateral soil extents and internal roughness characteristics within the medium are involved. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a generalized and accurate soil scattering modeling method based on a numerical solution to Maxwell’s equations in the volume-integral form (NMM3D-VIE). To efficiently treat large lateral domains, the soil is modeled as laterally periodic, and an effective truncation in depth is implemented through half-space Green’s functions. Within each periodic unit, inhomogeneous layered moisture are constructed to represent realistic near-surface layered soil conditions. The VIE is solved using the discrete dipole approximation, and its volumetric discretization enables the handling of arbitrary layered configurations, including internal roughness. The proposed method is first compared against the surface integral equation approach (SIE) and the advanced integral equation method (AIEM) across various single-layer soil conditions, demonstrating its accuracy and broad applicability. Furthermore, we present a novel investigation of the scattering properties of various layered soil structures to emphasize the layering effects in soil scattering observations, including the bistatic scattering coefficient in the incidence plane and in the top hemisphere, as well as the emissivity. The feasibility of equivalent single-layer strategies for representing the scattering behavior of realistic layered soils is also investigated. Additionally, the phase characteristics for single-layer and multi-layer soil structures are also investigated for the first time, with the proposed full-wave approach. This advanced model provides theoretical support and guidance for future research in complex soil scattering, layered soil approximation models, and inversion methodologies."

Battery-powered UAVs, however, face challenges due to limited endurance. An innovative alternative solution is a fuel cell hybrid power system, but it requires an efficient energy management system (EMS) to coordinate power distribution to meet load among hybrid sources. The drone application’s capabilities are restricted by its limited computational resources; thus, the development of lightweight computation EMS methods is required. This paper proposes a computationally efficient random forest (RF)-based EMS that is trained on data extracted offline from another optimization-based EMS in order to optimize the utilization of hybrid sources and to coordinate the power distribution at high computational efficiency. Simulation demonstrated the strategy’s efficacy; it reduces the battery state of charge (SOC) deviation, which extends the battery durability, and it also maintains a stable DC bus voltage stability close to its reference value. The strategy successfully reduces hydrogen consumption, showing economical and technical benefits at low computational demand."

A key characteristic of this method lies in the frame-by-frame extraction of driving manipulation data, vehicle trajectory, and motion state, which are then employed as the reference values for the preview-tracking controller to perform tracking tasks. Firstly, a framework for trajectory tracking control based on driving segment extraction and splicing is proposed, and the modelling and control process is standardized in a formal language. Secondly, a virtual driving platform based on PreScan+Simulink+CarSim is constructed to build the field, collect driving data from 30 testers, and build the driving segment database. Then, in order to reflect the wide range of validation results, driving type analyses are performed for all driving testers. Then, the trajectory tracking control algorithms applied to the driving segment extraction process and the splicing process are presented, respectively. Finally, simulation experiments and real vehicle experiments are designed to compare the Pearson similarity and feature parameters of manipulation behaviour and vehicle states of different drivers and different driving models. The results show that the new method can better simulate the driver's manipulation behaviour."

    "abstract": "With the increasing prevalence of DDoS attacks, various machine learning-based detection models have been employed to mitigate these malicious behaviors. Understanding how machine learning models function can be quite complex, especially for intricate and nonlinear models like deep learning architectures. Recently, various techniques have been advanced to interpret deep learning models and address issues of ambiguity. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of various explanation methods that are applied to Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on raw traffic data. While previous studies have focused primarily on improving detection accuracy on feature-based datasets, this paper emphasizes the importance of interpretability in deep learning models on raw-based traffic datasets. By employing explanation techniques such as LIME, SHAP, Anchor, and LORE, we provide insights into the decision-making processes of LSTM models, thereby enhancing trust and understanding in classifying DDoS attacks. The use of raw-based network traffic revealed crucial packet fields that played an important role behind the true and false positive predictions of the LSTM model, as well as identifying common network fields among the DDoS attacks to justify the misclassifications between similar DDoS attacks."

A siamese deep convolutional neural network, named S-DCNN, is then used to evaluate identity consistency between track segments, enabling re-identification without relying on explicit identity labels. Next, MDTrack employs a trajectory re-association approach that utilizes the temporal consistency of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mu$</tex-math></inline-formula>D features, ensuring stable target tracking even in the presence of occlusions and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that MDTrack significantly outperforms traditional methods, achieving a 94.42% accuracy for identity consistency and a 97.35% multi-object tracking accuracy in multi-target scenarios, which indicate robust performance in both closed-set and open-set conditions."

This letter proposes an anti-jamming array optimization method based on the radiation-scattering co-model. It statistically analyzes the probability distribution of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) under the target scattering and interference radiation, deduces the relationship between the cancellation spatial spectrum and array distribution, and establishes a distributed heterogeneous main-auxiliary array optimization model for the mainlobe interference cancellation. Experimental verification shows that the spatial resolution of the mainlobe interference cancellation. has improved from 2.2° to 0.1°, the SoI loss is ≤3 dB, the SINR increase is ≥27 dB. The proposed method effectively suppresses the mainlobe interference with high spatial resolution and low SoI loss."

The proposed strategy essentially accounts for the constraints imposed by the interceptor's seeker field-of-view (FOV) and actuator limitations, which, if ignored, can degrade guidance performance. To address these challenges, the guidance law incorporates known actuator bounds directly into its design, thereby improving overall interceptor effectiveness. The proposed method utilizes an input-affine magnitude saturation model to effectively enforce these constraints. By appending this input saturation model to the interceptor's kinematic equations, a guidance law is derived that ensures interception at the desired impact time while also accounting for the physical constraints of the sensor and actuator. The efficacy of the proposed strategies is demonstrated via comprehensive numerical simulations across a variety of engagement scenarios and compared against an existing method."

Traditional EVs isolation techniques, including ultracentrifugation and precipitation, are laborious and have inconsistent recovery rates. This study involved the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (GNPs), which were subsequently deposited onto SiO<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub> wafers. Subsequently, the surface was functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and activated using EDC/NHS chemistry to improve biomolecular binding. Approximately 6.8×10⁸ EVs particles were effectively extracted from 200 μL of serum samples utilizing the GNP-coated silicon substrate, representing a significant portion of the expected ∼2 × 10⁹ EVs typically present in such a volume. After immobilization, EVs were lysed directly on the surface using Triton X-100, and the lysis duration was optimized using Western blot analysis. The resultant lysate underwent EIS to assess variations in charge-transfer resistance (RCT), facilitating the precise identification of target proteins. The impedance response exhibited a concentration-dependent increase in charge-transfer resistance, with a detection limit of 1.206 pg/mL and a linear range of 62.5-2000 pg/mL. The results were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), affirming the reliability and specificity of the electrochemical platform. This integrated isolation-lysing system offers a scalable and effective approach for EVs isolation and protein extraction. The proposed technique, in conjunction with the sensing platform, can be utilized in point-of-care diagnostics and liquid biopsy-based cancer detection."

Conventional approaches rely on threshold voltage (Vt) shift measurements under thermal stress, which are often inaccessible in Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) NAND devices. In this work, we present a digital probing method to estimate activation energy using fail bit counts (λFBC), enabling reliability evaluation without requiring direct V. access. The proposed technique tracks bit-flip events caused by charge loss or injection at elevated temperatures (40∘C to 120 ∘C) and computes the median fail bit count (VFBC) over time. Using the Arrhenius relationship, we extract activation energies of 1.09 eV and 0.76 eV for 2D and 3D multi-level cell (MLC) NAND flash memory, respectively. The results highlight the architectural differences in degradation behavior and demonstrate the efficacy of.FBC as a digital reliability metric. Comparative analysis with existing threshold voltage-based methods validates the accuracy of the proposed technique. This work establishes a non-invasive and scalable method for activation energy extraction, facilitating comprehensive reliability characterization across modern NAND flash technologies."

    "abstract": "Fashion recommendation is crucial for consumers to express their self-image and personal style. To boost recommendation accuracy and rationality, researchers have explored state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that incorporate items’ visual and textual information, along with their pairing records. However, these methods fail to fully explore how latent semantic-stylistic correlations between items influence recommendations, and inadequately tackle exposure bias, which results in skewed, restricted recommendations that prioritize popular or frequently observed outfits. To address these limitations, we propose DRFusionRec, a fashion recommender that enhances recommendation rationality and diversity by fully leveraging item semantic-stylistic correlations while mitigating exposure bias. Specifically, to harness rich item correlations, we introduce a novel Multi-Factor Relationship Measurement (MRM) matrix. It integrates semantic and stylistic features by mining the synergistic interaction probabilities across semantically and stylistically adjacent items, capturing the latent compatibility patterns. This matrix is then used to refine item features for richer details. To address homogeneity from exposure bias, we propose an Adaptive Propensity Score (APS) strategy. By dynamically weighting item popularity (direct influence) and popularity of style-similar neighbors (indirect contextual influence), we model exposure confounders to derive item propensity scores. Integrating these scores into item features effectively mitigates the bias. Lastly, MRM and APS synergistically optimize item representations for rationale-based and diverse recommendations. Experimental results validate that the DRFusionRec outperforms SOTA methods in capturing item compatibility, ensuring diverse recommendations, and maintaining reasonable complexity."

PowerGear comprises two main components: a graph construction flow and a customized graph neural network (GNN) model. In the graph construction flow, PowerGear introduces buffer insertion, datapath merging, graph trimming and feature annotation techniques to transform HLS designs into graph-structured data, which encode both intra-operation micro-architectures and inter-operation interconnects annotated with switching activities. Additionally, PowerGear incorporates cross-function graph integration, dataflow adaptation, and design scaling strategies that make it compatible with multi-kernel, computation-intensive and large-scale applications. Furthermore, we propose a novel power-aware heterogeneous edge-centric GNN model, which effectively learns heterogeneous edge semantics and structural properties of the constructed graphs via edge-centric neighborhood aggregation, and eventually fits the formulation of dynamic power. Compared with on-board measurement, PowerGear shows average errors of 3.60% and 8.81% in total and dynamic power estimation, respectively. It also supports large-scale and dataflow-optimized neural networks with an error of only 3.91%, demonstrating broad applicability. Moreover, PowerGear achieves a 9.1× speedup over direct measurement, and up to 41.9× when combined with the design scaling strategy. Finally, PowerGear facilitates design space exploration for FPGA HLS, yielding a performance gain of up to 11.2% compared with state-of-the-art predictive models."

While high-quality AIGC generation under a cloud-edge-end three-layer architecture has attracted significant research attention, existing approaches often overlook trust challenges throughout the AIGC service lifecycle namely, in model provision, Service Provider (SP) selection, and product transaction. To address these issues, we introduce blockchain technology and propose a cloud-edge collaborative, blockchain oriented AIGC service architecture (CEAIGC). This architecture ensures secure and trustworthy interactions among AIGC model providers, SPs, and users. Specifically, we design embedded watermark coding rules for AIGC models and use blockchain to verify consistency between cloud and edge models, providing a reliable foundation for SPs. To further support trustwor thy SP selection, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that considers user utility, SP reputation, and energy consumption. We then propose a diffusion-model-enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm (DMA3C) to optimize SP selection and adaptively match metaverse user needs, enabling reliable, low-latency AIGC inference at the edge. To overcome blockchain performance bottlenecks, we employ a smart contract engine to establish state channels between transaction users. This enables efficient, secure, and atomic off-chain transfers of AIGC product ownership and service fees. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CEAIGC improves system throughput by 2.38×, and the proposed DMA3C algorithm achieves performance gains of 11.4% to 28.6% compared to other DRL-based approaches."

We review symbolizing strategies, entropy based measures (permutation entropy (PE), dispersion entropy(DispEn)) and compression based metrics (Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) and Effort-to-Compress (ETC)) and their applicability to scalp EEG, stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG), and thalamic EEG are studied. Due to constraints in data accessibility, signal nonstationarity and variability in annotated data, adopting these methods for thalamic EEG analysis poses a significant challenge. To address this, a theoretical benchmarking facility is developed comprising of chaotic signal models, surrogate testing, and stochastic models. Further, the effects of preprocessing filtering, segmentation and transforms application are studied with respect to the symbolization process and metric analysis. By integrating concepts from nonlinear dynamical systems, we propose to develop a framework that goes beyond descriptive complexity measures and bridges the gaps between symbol encoding, phase space embedding, and deep brain dynamics. Our goal is to establish complexity analysis of symbolic EEG as a rigorous and clinically relevant framework for characterizing and interpreting brain dynamics, especially for deep brain structures."

Specifically, a Swin transformer-based object recognition method is first introduced to identify the specified targets in the environment and simultaneously provide the coordinates of the target.

Leveraging the comprehensive indoor coverage of 5G cellular networks, this paper introduces FIVPos, a novel multi-beam fusion indoor positioning system designed for single-base-station scenarios. Unlike conventional approaches, FIVPos relies solely on transmission signals from a single commercial 5G base station, allowing simultaneous extraction of energy and distance information through a single receiving antenna. The proposed system builds on a multi-beam collaborative ranging model that combines carrier phase measurements with Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP). A lightweight stacked IMPos fingerprinting method is then employed to enhance dynamic positioning. To further improve robustness, a particle filter–based fusion framework integrates beam-based ranging with fingerprint-based matching, ensuring accurate and resilient positioning in complex indoor environments. Evaluation conducted in two representative indoor environments shows that FIVPos achieves sub-1.5-meter Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in dynamic scenarios, while delivering over 33% reduction in Maximum Error (MAXE) compared with conventional fingerprint-only approaches. These results confirm the effectiveness of multi-beam fusion as a practical and scalable solution for high-precision indoor positioning in 5G networks."

    "abstract": "Similarity search, which calculates proximity between high-dimensional vectors, is extensively used in modern data-driven applications, including Large-Language-Models (LLMs). A mainstream type of such algorithms is graph-based. A state-of-the-art algorithm in this paradigm is Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) which finds the nearest neighbor by traversing through a prebuilt graph. While the algorithm is efficient, it lacks parallelism and is not inherently suitable for hardware acceleration. In this work, we conduct a preliminary study on modifying the algorithm for hardware parallelism: By flattening the prebuilt hierarchical graph, we both enable distributed search and save the traversal iterations required in exchange for a modest increase in aggregate workloads. We verify the scalability of the modification across dataset dimensions and sizes. Finally, by benchmarking the algorithm with a real application example dataset, we observe a 2/3 reduction of the traversal iterations for 85% recall accuracy."

    "abstract": "Power outages continue to pose significant challenges, especially with the increase in adverse weather events. Rapid detection of such events is essential to minimize economic disruption and ensure public safety. Traditional detection methods, such as utility status reports, smart meter pinging, and customer complaint logs, are either expensive to implement at scale or suffer from latency in reaching all relevant stakeholders, including utilities, customers, and the general public. In many cases, these constraints can hinder timely and targeted responses during critical events. In this study, we present an alternate, scalable, and data-driven solution that leverages social media, specifically tweets from X (formerly Twitter), to detect power outages and identify their causes. Our hybrid architecture combines various natural language processing techniques with heuristic methods to effectively detect outages, extract their likely causes, and visualize affected areas. With careful hyperparameter tuning, the architecture achieved 98.7% accuracy and 99.4% precision in detecting outages, and 86.3% accuracy and 84.1% precision in identifying their causes. To demonstrate its operational utility, we also introduce an interactive dashboard that integrates these capabilities, offering a low-cost, real-time decision support tool for utilities, emergency response teams, and the general public, either as an alternative or a add-on. This work underscores the potential of social media as a valuable resource for enhancing situational awareness and response coordination during infrastructure disruptions through synthesized information."

    "abstract": "AI becomes increasingly important in safetycritical systems, especially in the case of autonomous systems, since navigation relies on AI for object detection and collision avoidance. However, safety-critical systems must adhere to functional safety standards that enforce software to be correct-by-construction, component decomposition to simplify design and validation, and the use of data only for testing purposes not to design the system itself. AI in general, and Deep Learning (DL) in particular have opposed characteristics since they have error rates (e.g., due to mispredictions), AI/DL modules can only be designed and validated monolithically, and they build on data for their design (i.e. for training purposes). Hence, DL solutions are at odds with the development process of safetycritical systems. A number of standards have recently emerged in different domains to reconcile the requirements of safety-critical systems with the characteristics of DL solutions, such as ISO 21448, ISO/IEC TR 5469, and ISO 8800, among others. However, there is a lack of realistic practice to design a DL-based safety-critical system in accordance with those regulations, and existing solutions only cover some aspects in isolation, and are often incompatible among them. SAFEXPLAIN is a 3-year Horizon Europe project addressing this challenge. SAFEXPLAIN, which finishes in September 2025, has already reached its main goals providing specific and complementary solutions to all those challenges so that AIbased safety-critical systems can be designed, implemented and validated adhering to the relevant functional safety standards in domains such as automotive, space and railway. In particular, SAFEXPLAIN provides the concepts, processes, tools and frameworks addressing the challenge end-to-end, from concept to solution. This is proven by the successful application of the SAFEXPLAIN approach in three case studies from the automotive, space and railway domains, whose results will see the light very soon."

    "abstract": "The hydrodynamic performance of bio-inspired underwater robots is fundamentally governed by their undulatory kinematics. This study focuses on the effects of three undulatory kinematic parameters - tail beat frequency, amplitude and wave number - on the propulsive performance of simulated robotic fish employing body and/or caudal fin (BCF) locomotion. In contrast to conventional research, the body kinematic equation was modified herein to better capture the realistic biomechanical constraint: the longitudinal length of the bio-inspired robotic fish remains invariant regardless of its oscillatory angle. Computational fluid dynamics was been used and the propulsion performance under the coupled effects of multiple undulatory parameters was systematically analyzed. Additionally, two distinct turbulent inflow conditions were established to evaluate the impact of incoming vortex streets on fish-like propulsion ability. Results indicate that increasing tail beat frequency enhances mean thrust generation, particularly under conditions of large amplitude and small wave number gain. However, the effects of undulation amplitude and wave number on thrust production exhibit more complex dependencies. While mean thrust generally increases with greater amplitude gain and reduced wave number gain, certain conditions lead to opposing trends. Inflow with relatively low Reynolds numbers was found to enhance rapid-start swimming capability, whereas appropriately developed turbulent vortex streets could provide auxiliary propulsion under specific circumstances. These findings underscore the necessity of optimizing the coordination between frequency, amplitude, and wave number to achieve peak swimming performance, as well as the importance of adaptive adjustments in response to hydrodynamic conditions. The insights obtained from this study provide valuable practical references for improving the propulsion performance of bionic fish robots, such as in the design of variable stiffness fish robots and the optimization of swimming control."

While there has been a proliferation of law oriented solutions based on large language models recently, there are still gaps in addressing information extraction from French marine environmental law documents. This paper aims to bridge this gap, by proposing an approach that uses prompt based language models to build a low-cost instruction dataset on French marine environmental law which will be used to fine tune two open-source models, LLaMA 3 and Vigogne. Results show that fine-tuned models significantly outperform their competitors such as LLaMA 3.

    "abstract": "Replicating both power grasp and precision pinch capabilities in myoelectric prostheses remains challenging, as most current designs require multiple actuators per finger, which increases the size, weight, and control complexity. Hence, a compact finger mechanism that can switch seamlessly between these two fundamental grip modes with only a single motor embedded in the palm is yet to be realized. This study proposes a novel finger mechanism that supports multiple finger motions with a minimal number of motors. Notably, the singular configuration of the linkage enables selective activation of the proximal interphalangeal joint using only one motor, thus achieving two distinct movements: “grasping” and “pinching.” We designed a compound four-bar linkage mechanism integrated with a linear actuator such that reversing the rotational direction of the motor yielded two different flexion trajectories. Furthermore, by placing small motors within the palm and utilizing 3D-printed resin components reinforced with metal screws, the dimensions of a human finger could be approached without compromising strength. A prototype demonstrated smooth and reliable switching between “grasp” and “pinch,” thereby enhancing user comfort and reducing fatigue."

To address these issues, and enable operation in higher voltage ranges, this work investigates the use of unexplored polysilicon PIN diodes implemented on an insulating area as an alternative solution to PN diodes integrated on bulk substrates. The geometric design and process optimizations of the PIN diode structure are explored to optimize its performances (forward and leakage currents, series resistance, threshold, and breakdown voltages) while ensuring compatibility with low-cost analog circuits fabricated in an 40nm technology dedicated to IoT applications. Compared to classical PN diodes, PIN diodes require a simple fabrication process and can provide a breakdown voltage twice higher. However, this improvement comes at the expense of an increased leakage current and series resistance."

    "abstract": "Lunar robots serve as the core equipment for surface exploration and operational tasks in lunar exploration projects, holding invaluable importance in deep space exploration and lunar scientific research. This study addresses the constraints of space and weight limitations for future lunar robots by proposing a humanoid robot composite joint based on a single joint-single drive, incorporating both wheeled and legged motion modes. To achieve independence between the two motion modes, this paper employs a planetary gear system combined with electromagnetic brakes to design a switchable transmission linkage. Furthermore, a dynamic model of the planetary gear system and a mathematical model of motor drive are established, leading to a motion control framework that includes torque feedforward. The results of co-simulation experiments indicate maximum tracking errors of 0.95% for the wheeled mode and 1.3% for the legged mode, validating the effectiveness of the control strategy. Prototype experimental results demonstrate that the proposed wheel-legged composite joint achieves stable switching between motion modes and independent motion output, confirming the feasibility of the design. In the future, the design of this composite joint can provide a reference for developing lunar robot movement systems."

Our system constructs a sparse, structured map that integrates multi-level topology, multimodal sensor data, and inter-object relationships. This approach bridges low-level perception with high-level LLM reasoning. Experiments in simulated rescue environments demonstrate that our framework significantly improves path optimization, task completion rates, and causal reasoning accuracy. These results validate the system's ability to enhance the cognitive capabilities of LLM-driven medical robots in complex scenarios."

This device allows real-time pulse rate monitoring and adjusts the walking resistance automatically based on the user's exercise intensity derived from pulse rate. The PPG sensor, embedded in the handle of the device, demonstrated accuracy comparable to commercial PPG and ECG systems, even during movement. To improve signal reliability during walking, we applied a processing method that utilizes the second harmonic component of the heart wave, which helped reduce motion-induced artifacts. We also designed a feedback control algorithm that maintains exercise intensity within a target aerobic range (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$40-50 \\%$</tex> of Karvonen intensity) by adjusting the brake resistance in real time. In trials with young and adult participants, the system achieved the intended aerobic intensity without causing overexertion. Feedback control experiments confirmed that the device could guide users toward and maintain aerobic exercise levels effectively. These findings suggest that the system can serve as a personalized training tool to support endurance enhancement and help prevent frailty in the elderly through safe, pulse rate-guided walking exercise."

However, this requires de-energizing the lines to get the measurement, which can experience induced voltage and current from adjacent energized lines, compromising both measurement accuracy and field personnel safety. To avoid measurement equipment damage and hazards, induced voltage on de-energized lines should not exceed 500 V. So, utilities often de-energize all coupled lines to mitigate risk, but such practices disrupt service and reduce grid reliability and sometimes it is not possible. This research proposes an engineering solution tailored to electric utility needs, combining EMTP-based simulations and a custom software tool to accurately estimate induced voltage and current. The tool can also identify the minimum number of lines to de-energize, ensuring induced voltage stays below 500 V while minimizing operational impacts. Using transmission datasets from Entergy Services, the proposed method was validated, demonstrating its effectiveness and applicability in addressing industry challenges."

    "abstract": "Electrification of heavy goods vehicles currently represents the most promising pathway to decarbonizing long-haul freight. The larger battery sizes compared to light-duty vehicles mean that charging times are likely to slow down freight operation significantly. Battery swapping stations, where the empty battery is swapped with another pre-charged battery, represent a promising alternative. In this paper we develop a model to determine the optimal logistics system, including the purchase of trucks, battery swapping stations, chargers, and warehouse space. By taking this integrated approach, we can understand the trade-offs of between battery swapping and other components of the supply chain. Using a case study involving seven cities, we show that battery swapping stations are installed when battery costs account for less than 40% of the truck cost. We show that the inclusion of swappable batteries results in a smaller truck fleet. The number of surplus batteries required depends strongly on the charging speed; with 500 MW (the current fastest chargers), around 1.2 batteries per truck were selected. We find that battery swapping increases utilization of renewable energy by less than 1%; the high utilization of trucks and batteries does not provide much energy flexibility in the considered case."

HIF faults create very slight deviations in sensor readings, often mistaken for non-fault switching events. Usually, HIF fault waveforms are seen to be very close to capacitor bank switching events. This paper compares the performance of several machine learning and deep learning-based approaches, namely, DT, RF, SVM, convolutional neural networks (CNN), gated recurrent units (GRU) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models for HIF detection. Five evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under curve are observed for comparative analysis. The SVM model shows accuracy scores of 84.00%, RF shows 99.63%, DT shows 100%, CNN shows 95.306%, and GRU and LSTM show 97.074% each. The shallow models prove to have their own strengths in terms of HIF detection. The deeper models are found to be more prone to overfitting compared to the shallower models."

    "abstract": "Accurate and automated assignment of ICD-9 diagnosis codes from unstructured clinical narratives is a critical yet challenging task due to the multi-label nature of the problem and the inherent class imbalance present in real-world electronic health records. In this research, we introduce a deep learning (DL) approach leveraging a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture, incorporating a fuzzy logic module, to address these challenges on the MIMIC-III dataset. Our model processes patient discharge summaries to predict the top 25 ICD-9 codes, framed as a multi-label classification problem. We employ Fuzzy logic to improve test accuracy, enhance model calibration, and improve learning from rare, underrepresented diagnoses. We evaluate our proposed model using key performance metrics. Results show that incorporating a Fuzzy System significantly helps the model to better identify minority classes without sacrificing overall predictive performance. Our proposed method offers a clinically meaningful and scalable solution for automating medical code assignment in hospital information systems."

Forward back-gate biasing enables robust 4 K operation without a cryo-specific PDK. The divider achieves 1.08 ps RMS jitter and –145.5 dBc/Hz phase noise at 100 kHz offset while consuming 450 µW for the core and 800 µW for the buffer at 4 K. Measurements across temperature and bias points reveal body-bias impact on jitter and noise, guiding cryo-CMOS optimization. Compared to prior work, this design offers higher divide ratio, wider temperature range, and compatibility with standard CMOS. Integration within a cryogenic Phase Locked Loop (PLL) confirms system-level functionality and suitability for scalable, energy-efficient quantum systems."

    "abstract": "Human-robot collaborative assembly (HRCA) has gained the attention of researchers due to the potential to combine the operator's flexibility with the robot's precision. In HRCA, implementing robotic dynamic collision avoidance can effectively minimize injuries and equipment damage. However, it is challenging to acquire the optimal collision avoidance motion path for the robot in real time, considering the safety of the moving operator and the efficiency of assembly. In this paper, a dynamic collision avoidance method considering real-time performance and the shortest path length for HRCA is proposed. Attractive, repulsive and tangential forces are generated aimed at enabling the robot to reach the target position while avoiding the collision with the operator. To improve the success rate of collision avoidance and reduce the path length, the force weight is introduced to generate the optimal guidance force. The genetic algorithm is applied to obtain the optimal solution of the force weight with the self-built collision avoidance training scenarios. Experiments are conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed method and its applications in the real-world HRCA scenario."

In this preliminary study, we explore the use of TabPFN, a pretrained Tabular Foundation Model (TabFM) based on In-Context Learning (ICL), for MCU performance prediction. TabPFN eliminates the need for task-specific training or tuning by conditioning directly on labeled examples provided at inference time, enabling few-shot and zero-shot learning. We evaluate TabPFN on two distinct MCU datasets and compare its performance with conventional ML models, including tree-based and linear approaches. Our results show that TabPFN consistently achieves competitive accuracy with minimal human supervision, demonstrating its potential as a fast, generalizable, and low-maintenance alternative for performance screening in semiconductor manufacturing."

Fuzzing has become a popular method for detecting applications by generating many random inputs. However, the effectiveness of fuzzing largely depends on the quality of the seeds used to guide the fuzzing process. Existing seed selection strategies often have limitations in terms of efficiency and ability to explore deep paths and complex program logic. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a seed generation method using a diffusion generation model, which consists of collecting high-quality training datasets using parallel fuzzing, feeding them into a diffusion generation model after data preprocessing to learn the characteristics of the data distributions, and generating diverse seeds. The experiments are fuzzing using the newly generated seeds, and the results are improved in the three metrics of branch coverage, path triggering, and crash triggering, proving the effectiveness of the method."

    "abstract": "Diabetes affects over 589 million adults worldwide, with diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) – chronic wounds that delay or fail to heal - as one of its most severe complications. Current DFU management practices, reliant on frequent dressing changes, impose substantial physical, emotional, economic, and environmental burdens on patients, caregivers, and healthcare systems. This study introduces a sustainable framework for smart electronic wound care systems, integrating Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate environmental impacts during the design process of electronics. Guided by social and environmental sustainability principles, the framework aims to enhance personalized care and reduce ecological footprints. Two design strategies were assessed: the Reduce Strategy, a minimalistic single-use system, and the Reuse Strategy, a modular system with reusable electronics. Both designs utilize a flexible printed circuit board with integrated sensors and an integrated circuit for continuous monitoring of wound status markers such as pH and temperature. LCA results reveal that integrating electronics introduces significant environmental burdens. While the Reduce Strategy fails to offset these impacts during the use phase, the Reuse Strategy demonstrates clear long-term sustainability benefits, particularly during extended treatment durations compared to state-of-the-art care. By embedding sustainability principles into early-stage design, this work advances the dual goals of delivering personalized patient care and promoting environmentally conscious healthcare innovation, aligning with the vision of a Human-Centric Society."

However, current gaze-based assistive systems mainly help users with basic grasping actions, offering limited support. Moreover, the restricted intent recognition capability constrains the assistive system's ability to provide diverse assistance functions. In this paper, we propose an open implicit intention recognition framework powered by Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Foundation Model (VFM), which can process gaze input and recognize user intents that are not confined to predefined or specific scenarios. Furthermore, we implement a gaze-driven LLM-enhanced assistive robot system (MindEye-OmniAssist) that recognizes user's intentions through gaze and assists in completing task. To achieve this, the system utilizes open vocabulary object detector, intention recognition network and LLM to infer their full intentions. By integrating eye movement feedback and LLM, it generates action sequences to assist the user in completing tasks. Real-world experiments have been conducted for assistive tasks, and the system achieved an overall success rate of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$41 / 55$</tex> across various undefined tasks.

However, many existing AI-based IDS oversimplify the problem by using outdated datasets and binary classification schemes, limiting their real-world applicability. In this work, we propose a TabNet a deep learning framework for robust multi-class attack detection in ICS environments. TabNet's sequential attention and sparse feature selection mechanisms make it particularly well-suited for heterogeneous tabular data. The model was evaluated on two recent and structurally aligned datasets, ICS-Flow and Westermo. Our approach achieved robust performance for 5-class classification within the ICS-Flow dataset and 4-class identification within the Westermo dataset, attaining F1-scores of 96.70% and 98.38%, respectively, effectively detecting both frequent and rare attack types. Confusion matrix analysis highlights the model's reliability in accurately identifying normal traffic with a very low false positive rate, while also minimizing the misclassification of attacks as normal a critical factor in securing ICS environments. These results demonstrate the suitability of TabNet for real-world ICS defense, offering a balance of accuracy, generalization, and interpretability with minimal preprocessing."

The THz transceiver employs a standard feed horn integrated with a 3D-printed bracket to enhance the gain and bandwidth of the TA lens antenna, where the TA lens antenna adopts a “sandwich” architecture composed of a V-shaped copper rotator, a dielectric substrate, and a grating. The resonant design of unit cells facilitates full phase control across 0 to 360° by polarization conversion at frequency between 0.20 to 0.26 THz. Experimental results indicate the fabricated TA lens antenna attains a peak gain of 36.1 dBi and aperture efficiency of 54.45% at 0.244 THz, with a 3-dB bandwidth exceeding 33 GHz. We successfully employed the TA lens antenna to a THz wireless communication experiment. We achieved a single-carrier modulation 100 Gbps data link at a symbol rate of 20 Gbaud for 32-quadrature amplitude modulation (32-QAM), and achieved a bit-error rate (BER) of 1.5 × 10⁻² without forward-error correction. This proposed TA lens antenna transceiver offers a high-gain, compact solution for achieving high data rate THz communications."

    "abstract": "Navigating unknown environments with a single RGB camera is challenging, as the lack of depth information prevents reliable collision-checking. While some methods use estimated depth to build collision maps, we found that depth estimates from vision foundation models are too noisy for zero-shot navigation in cluttered environments. We propose an alternative approach: instead of using noisy estimated depth for direct collision-checking, we use it as a rich context input to a learned collision model. This model predicts the distribution of minimum obstacle clearance that the robot can expect for a given control sequence. At inference, these predictions inform a risk-aware MPC planner that minimizes estimated collision risk. We proposed a joint learning pipeline that co-trains the collision model and risk metric using both safe and unsafe trajectories. Crucially, our joint-training ensures well calibrated uncertainty in our collision model that improves navigation in highly cluttered environments. Consequently, real-world experiments show reductions in collision-rate and improvements in goal reaching and speed over several strong baselines."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates constrained multi-autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) systems with hysteresis output. First, two novel shift functions are proposed to construct new state variables, addressing the issue of initial position and velocity variables of AUVs exceeding predefined boundaries. Based on these new state variables and combined with a coordinate transformation method, asymmetric time-varying full-state constraints independent of the initial conditions are achieved. Moreover, an innovative predefined-time convergence criterion is introduced. Based on this criterion, the proposed strategy ensures robust consensus within a predefined time under asymmetric full-state constraints, while effectively handling external disturbances, hysteresis, and saturation issues. A novel scaling inequality related to the hyperbolic tangent function is also proposed. Based on this scaling inequality, the sign function is replaced with the hyperbolic tangent function in the controller, and the proposed control scheme completely avoids issues of singularity and chattering. By leveraging neural networks (NN) and adaptive parameters to manage uncertainties and complex terms, the proposed control scheme successfully avoids the explosion of complexity. Notably, through adaptive parameter estimation, the negative impacts on system stability caused by deviations of the neural network weight matrix from its optimal value and approximation errors introduced by the neural network are mitigated. The closed-loop system is proven to be predefined-time stable. In addition, the sensitivity of the system to measurement noise is analyzed, and a NN-based observer is proposed to significantly mitigate the adverse effects caused by noise. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is validated through numerical simulation."

Methods: This study leveraged task-fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) n-back paradigm. The Neurofunctional Integration and Specificity Analysis (NISA) framework was proposed to synergistically combine Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) and multivoxel machine learning classification and regression, enabling distinct characterization of visual perception and VWM processes. Functional connectivity (FC) patterns of NISA-selected regions of interest were further integrated with transcriptomic data to probe molecular substrates. Results: Bilateral fusiform gyrus (FFG) voxel patterns showed maximal stimulus representation fidelity (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</i> = -0.43 to -0.42, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">q</i> < 1.05 × 10⁻¹³⁰), with 80% 4-class category decoding accuracy and significant behavioral prediction (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</i> = 0.42 to, 0.56, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">q</i> < 2.85 × 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">⁻7</sup>).

Conclusion: The FFG operates as a dual-process hub, concurrently mediating visual perceptual categorization and working memory maintenance. Its synergistic excitation-inhibition in FFG may optimize the behavior performance through dynamic resource allocation, while FC-transcriptome coupling further revealed gene networks implicated in cognitive vulnerability across VWM categories."

These configurations are essential for achieving high power density and rapid dynamic response, with conventional topologies including rectangular, skewed, diamond, and hexagonal. To further reduce material consumption, improve magnetic flux utilization, and enhance electromagnetic performance, this article proposes a novel elliptical winding topology, with a focus on its implementation in coreless brushed permanent magnet dc motors (CBPMDCMs). The structural design of the motor and elliptical winding is first introduced. Detailed analytical models for back EMF, electromagnetic, and mechanical characteristics are then developed and validated through 3-D finite element analysis (3-D FEA). A comparative study is subsequently conducted between the elliptical winding and conventional windings under identical performance requirements. The results demonstrate that the elliptical winding achieves higher flux utilization, lower copper consumption, improved efficiency, and stronger short-term overload capability, while maintaining competitive electromagnetic and mechanical performance."

    "abstract": "Autonomous obstacle avoidance in dynamic and unknown environments is essential for mobile robots, forming a prerequisite for many high-level tasks. However, existing methods are often constrained by the limited computational and energy resources of mobile platforms, making it challenging to ensure both obstacle avoidance performance and operational efficiency. In contrast, the human brain demonstrates remarkable adaptability and exploration capabilities in unfamiliar environments while consuming an extremely small amount of energy. Inspired by this, we propose a novel brain-inspired obstacle avoidance method that integrates brain-like perception, data fusion, and control strategies, offering both computational and energy efficiency. We employ a bio-inspired event camera to efficiently capture motion cues of objects in the environment and extract salient features using a spiking-driven self-attention-based event variational autoencoder (SDSA-EVAE). To compensate for the lack of depth information, we incorporate LiDAR to complement visual input through a multimodal fusion algorithm inspired by neuronal diversity. This functionality is achieved using a reinforcement learning framework that leverages a hybrid architecture of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and spiking neural networks (SNNs). Comparative simulations with baseline models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, while physical experiments validate its practical applicability. Furthermore, deployment on a neuromorphic processor confirms the energy efficiency of the method."

This paper presents the design and manufacturing of a tailless four-winged FWMAV, which is driven by two motors through two flexure- hinge transmission mechanisms to actuate two pairs of wings. Our work enhances the assembly efficiency of FWMAVs through optimized in both design and manufacturing processes. Inspired by the flapping wing system of flying insects in nature, we adopt a compliant flexure-hinge transmission mechanism, enabling lightweight construction, improved assembly efficiency, and wing reversal capability. A rapid smart composite microstructure (R-SCM) process is proposed to accelerate the fabrication of compliant transmission mechanism, reducing 90% of the fabrication time compared to the standard SCM process. The final FWMAV prototype weighs 6.2 g, has a wingspan of 17 cm, and a single-sided flapping angle of 103°. In tethered flight tests using a pendulum setup, the prototype overcame gravity under a 3.4 V input voltage, achieving motion above the pendulum's horizontal plane within 0.247 s, validating the design and manufacturing approach."

At the time of writing, we were unaware of any side-channel attack on hardware implementation of the SipHash. A leakage function was built that is able to compute part of the internal state after 1 round based on just a few bits of the key. Our approach is based on progressively eliminating incorrect subkeys in iterations, while adding new bits of the key we attack, rather than trying to extract the subkey directly. The total amount of key hypotheses does not exceed a limit when it becomes unfeasible to compute. In the end, all 128 bits of the SipHash key are retrieved solely from the Hamming distance of the initial state and the state after first round."

Robots leverage sensors to construct global environmental models and perform precise path planning, yet remain inferior to mice in terms of flexible local perception and olfactory sensitivity. To integrate the advantages of biological and artificial systems, this paper proposes a “mouse-vehicle” hybrid intelligent robot, establishing a collaborative mode that synergizes biological free exploration with robotic auxiliary intervention. The system achieves real-time localization of the mouse and vehicle via an overhead camera, leveraging YOLO-based object detection and PID tracking algorithms to drive a differential-driven vehicle for retrieving the mouse during critical entrapment scenarios.

Magnetic skyrmions can be stabilised, manipulated, and detected in racetrack-like devices. An effective method for skyrmion nucleation and manipulation involves injecting current pulses into the track, resulting in spin torque applied to the quasi-particles. Precise and controlled pulse timing is crucial, as timing deviations may fail to nucleate or sufficiently propagate skyrmions leading to partial or catastrophic loss of information. In addition, the overhead in power from electric circuits should be low compared to the skyrmionic device. A robust, programmable nanosecond scale pulse generator is presented, tailored to skyrmion nucleation and transportation. The circuit is designed in an industrial 0.18 µm technology and consumes only 150 nW, on average, at a Vdd of 1.8 V. PVT Monte Carlo simulations show that the standard deviation of the resulting pulse width does not exceed 7%, while the circuit operates autonomously without requiring an external clock.

However, it is still a challenge to formulate structure color hydrogels with multifunctionality (e.g. robust toughness, strong adhesion, high stretchability, and high electronic conductivity) without compromising their intrinsic optical properties. In this paper, we report a multifunctional structural color hydrogel by incorporating a conductive polymer Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly (styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) into a mechanically robust poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/poly (acrylic acid) (PAA) double network (DN) hydrogel. The as-prepared structural color hydrogel could span a wide range of mechanical properties by simply tuning the polymer composition and the number of freezing-thawing cycles. The dynamic hydrogen bonding interactions endow the hydrogel sensor with reversible adhesion to different substrates. In particular, the structural color hydrogel shows high sensitivity in optical and electronic sensing capability, and can accurately detect some human movements. This work provides useful insights into the development of functional structural colors for wearable soft electronics."

TMS, which uses the data distribution service (DDS) middleware, enables plug-and-play capability of microgrid power devices by defining standardized data models of various devices and controllers, such as inverters and generators. This standardization allows microgrid controllers to identify device types and capabilities in a fast and efficient manner. Most legacy power devices do not support TMS, preventing widespread deployment. To make these legacy power devices TMS compliant, this paper presents an intermediary communication converter with bidirectional translation of DDS messages to/from legacy communication protocols such as Modbus TCP. The converter was implemented on a single-board computer with DDS software and a custom Python device control module. Our tests demonstrate that the converter allows a TMS microgrid controller to command a legacy Modbus-based relay.

However, current control methods, which are primarily confined to small-scale systems, face critical challenges in maintaining stable and efficient guidance during long-distance motion control. This paper presents a novel large-distance control system capable of achieving robust and precise motion across extended operational domains. The integrated magnet system generates a rotating magnetic field that induces the spiral trajectory migration of magnetized particles toward designated targets. Our hybrid control framework strategically combines attitude constraints with visual feedback to preserve swarm integrity, while implementing Gaussian-based density evaluation for minimizing motion loss.

The architecture includes one input and output signal per channel (6 for Mission 1, 11 for Mission 2), and three hidden layers with 256, 128, and 64 neurons. An adaptive Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (adLIF) neuron model was employed to enhance temporal memory through an adaptive current mechanism. The network was implemented in snnTorch, with quantization effects modeled during inference to support future deployment on FPGA. The proposed model achieved an event-wise F0.5-score of 0.776 on Mission 1 and 0.971 on Mission 2, demonstrating the feasibility of applying SNNs to time-series anomaly detection tasks in resource-constrained space environments."

    "abstract": "This paper reports results for a survey performed to characterize support for four different visions of developing Iowa’s electric infrastructure. The survey, conducted in the fall of 2024, obtained responses from 1630 Iowans ages 18-86 residing in 93 of its 99 counties. Results of the survey indicate that energy cost and resilience are high priorities for Iowans whereas greenhouse gas reduction and energy exporting, though important to some sub-populations, are lower priorities overall. These and other results of the survey help to inform utilities, regulatory bodies, the region’s planning coordinator, and state, county, and municipal agencies of likely support for the different development directions in one of the nation’s most renewable-rich states. The information will be paired with results in an ongoing study funded by the state of Iowa and conducted by the authors to provide least-cost 20-year grid investment plans corresponding to each vision."

    "abstract": "Hacker attacks are a rapidly increasing problem in the modern world. Data must be protected from unauthorized access and communication must be secure. All this requires unpredictable data. True random number generators (TRNGs) provides such numbers. In order to be able to change the secret keys for encryption frequently, TRNGs with a high data rate are required. They must also be protected against attacks. These are precisely the problems that will be examined in this paper. Inverter based Ring oscillators (IROs) offer the possibility of generating randomness through physically induced jitter with little effort in terms of gates and power consumption. However, they seem to offer hackers more opportunities for attacks, but even self-timed rings (STRs) are not immune to attacks. It is shown here how to equip IROs with three online tests that can detect a variety of attacks. One of them is new. The tests are based on extensive measurements and evaluations of simulations at transistor level. Three sample bits are crucial for the proposed online tests but are not necessarily required for entropy harvesting. But if you can prove that several samples from an IRO are independent of each other, then you can also use them to multiply the entropy and consequently the possible data rate. In this paper, we make use of artificial intelligence for this purpose. It is essential to understand the circuit used at transistor level and to recover the internal pulse diagrams from the measurements. Since this procedure is hardly possible with human intellect, we use AI for this purpose. For post processing, parallel XOR processing with different compression factors is proposed in order to avoid entropy loss. A bias test of the output completes the online tests."

We implement a Network Intrusion Detection System by showing how three open-source tools can be used: Suricata performs deep packet inspection and uses signaturebased threat detection, Zeek (formerly Bro) provides advanced network traffic analysis and logging, and Elastic Stack (Filebeat, Elasticsearch, Kibana) allows real-time data indexing, search, and interactive visualization. For comprehensive threat detection, our integrated solution uses the Suricata rule-based engine with the behavioral analysis provided by Zeek. We offer centralized monitoring using the scalable log management of Elastic Stack and the Kibana dashboards. Thus, this contribution achieves enterprise-grade network visibility without vendor lock-in and is specifically suitable for organizations operating on a limited security budget. Future improvements will be related to machine learning integration for anomaly detection, and support for encrypted traffic analysis will be extended."

By creating and injecting a false attack vector to evade system detection, the false data injection attack poses a danger to grid security. The variety of assaults makes it impossible to use fixed approaches to identify false data injection attacks. This study introduced a method using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to spot false data injection attacks and disconnect the microgrid from the main grid to reduce the impact of the attack. Initially, we examined an attack model assuming infinite attack resources and full topological information. Identification of false data injection attacks (FDIAs) is suggested using a deep reinforcement learning-based approach. Simulation on MATLAB Simulink of the microgrid islanding system demonstrated the effectiveness of the detection technique and the validity of the attack mitigation model."

As a response to the discovery of numerous micro-architectural side channel attacks such as Spectre, allowing an attacker to extract secret information in pernicious ways, the notion of hardware/software contracts was proposed to formalise the guarantees provided by the hardware to the software. In this paper, we propose to extend this notion to include the guarantees provided by the operating system (OS), so far unspecified in such contracts. We formalize an attacker model adapted to a typical execution model on a shared platform. More precisely, we formalize common thread and memory management policies provided by the OS on top of a hardware model and explore the consequences of potential leaks emerging on such a platform. Our investigation shows that the OS policies play a crucial role in providing security guarantees to code processing sensitive data and thus have to be taken into consideration when writing such code through platform contracts."

However, in dynamic scenarios such as bone penetration, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors often suffer from response delays and inertia-induced lag, which compromise force control accuracy. To address this issue, this study focuses on a fiber-optic six-dimensional force sensing and its dynamic error compensation during bone drilling by Least Squares Support Vector Regression (LSSVR). Compared to the traditional Auto-Regressive with exogenous inputs (ARX) model, the LSSVR offers superior accuracy and robustness, reconstructing the input from historical outputs to achieve real-time compensation. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances dynamic response accuracy across all six-dimensional force vectors, with an overshoot of less than 13 %, a settling time of under 15 ms, and a full-scale relative error of below 9%."

Additionally, both phase and amplitude dithering are applied to improve the output signal quality. The DDFS design has been modeled using register transfer level VHDL code and implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA). The design consumes 276 LUTs and 304 Flip-Flops on the FPGA and with dithering it is capable of reaching -72.5 dBc spurious free dynamic range (SFDR)."

High-resolution current signals of the generator step-up transformer are obtained via a wind turbine model simulated in MATLAB/Simulink. Deep learning models, including long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent units (GRU), and convolutional neural networks (CNN), are employed for both tasks. Experimental results demonstrate excellent performance and robustness under diverse noise conditions. Specifically, LSTM outperforms GRU and CNN in both tasks, with slight decreases in accuracy only for severity estimation on minor faults and phase identification on the low-voltage side. The results confirm the practical effectiveness and noise resilience of the framework for ITSCF diagnosis in wind turbine generator step-up transformers."

A quarter-rate clocking architecture is adopted to investigate the impact of different driver and Feed-Forward Equalizer (FFE) implementations on complexity, area, and power consumption across varying data rates. Three transmitter architectures are designed and simulated in 22 nm CMOS technology, following the standard as a guideline. Analog and digital FFE implementations are combined with voltage-mode, conventional and DAC driver implementations. All three designs employ a 4-tap FFE as required by the specification. Among them, the DAC-based design achieves the highest energy efficiency and smallest area, whereas the all-analog solution ranks second.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in arithmetic systems have emphasized the need for faster, resource-efficient operations without compromising on the range or accuracy provided by the IEEE 754 floating-point format. Consequently, the Posit number system has gained attention for its computational efficiency and broader dynamic range. However, multiplication remains one of the most computationally expensive operations in Posit arithmetic, with traditional multipliers suffering from additional overhead due to complex decoders. This paper proposes a novel and efficient Posit multiplier architecture that addresses these challenges by modifying the conventional decoder. Specifically, we introduce multiflag priority encoders to streamline the decoding process, thereby leveraging the silicon footprint utilized by the design and benefiting critical path delay. We also present a modified multistage Booth encoding technique, optimized for the Posit format, to enhance multiplier speed without compromising on accuracy. Additionally, the clock-gating technique applied to the multi-level encoding architecture selectively disables clock signals during idle cycles, ensuring further savings in power. The combination of new decoders and power optimization strategies establishes a hardware-efficient Posit multiplier, which was validated for a DCT compression application. Implementation results demonstrate that the proposed Posit multiplier offers power savings up to $46 \\%$ with respect to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) Posit and other floating-point multipliers. Furthermore, the proposed architecture achieves a $48 \\%$ silicon footprint savings. The hardware efficiency of the proposed Posit multiplier, along with the acceptable DCT-compressed image quality results, validates the novel contribution and its effectiveness. All the design files are made freely available for further usage by the designers and research community."

    "abstract": "With the continuous development of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and cloud computing, an increasing number of firms store industrial data in the cloud. However, data outsourcing raises owners’ concerns about the confidentiality of their data, prompting them to encrypt data before uploading. When all files are encrypted, it becomes tough to locate specific ones. Searchable encryption enables users to retrieve needed data from encrypted datasets. Most existing keyword-searchable encryption schemes are designed for single-user scenarios; yet in practice, multiple users often access the same data, making single-user schemes unsuitable for multi-user environments. Additionally, sharing data on untrusted devices may lead to single key leakage. This paper presents a new searchable encryption scheme that supports multi-user search. By integrating blockchain, it addresses the problem of single key leakage. The scheme is proven to be impervious to keyword-guessing attacks and achieves trapdoor unlinkability, further enhancing data confidentiality. Performance evaluations compared with existing schemes demonstrate the proposed scheme’s efficiency and feasibility in IIoT deployments."

    "abstract": "Although radio frequency (RF) sensing offers a promising approach for monitoring human cardiac activity, it traditionally requires subjects to remain in a steady-state throughout the monitoring process to avoid motion artifacts—an inherently impractical constraint that hampers real-world adoption. However, existing methods either yield incorrect estimates from motion-affected segments or discard them entirely, leading to fragmented data and incomplete observations. To address the challenge, we introduce MaskSense, a novel framework designed to address motion interference in long-term monitoring. The key insight is that latent patterns within dynamic inter-beat interval (IBI) sequences allow for accurate heartbeat reconstruction from incomplete observations. Leveraging this insight, MaskSense treats motion-affected periods as ”masked” and steady-state periods as ”unmasked”, and employs a contrastive-learning-assisted masked modeling architecture to reconstruct the masked information. Our 400-hour evaluation with 18 participants confirms that MaskSense effectively recovers IBIs in the presence of motion artifacts, paving the way for more natural and unobtrusive RF-based cardiac activity monitoring."

    "abstract": "The non-contact acoustic manipulation of particle clusters has great potential in various fields. However, current acoustic manipulation technologies for particle cluster manipulation primarily focus on aggregating particles to a specific shape, while morphological transformation of aggregated particle clusters remains an unsolved challenge. In this work, a non-contact acoustic manipulation system for real-time dynamic particle cluster morphological transformation was presented. The system primarily consisted of an ultrasonic phased transducer array (PTA) generating holographic acoustic end-effector (HAE), and a visual servo system to precisely localize the HAE and particles. A theoretical analysis of equal-area transformation was provided to guide the reshaping of particle clusters. A physical-based deep learning algorithm was proposed for computation of phase-only holograms (POHs) for super-resolution HAE. Experimental results validated the efficacy of the proposed system in dynamically transforming the shape of particle clusters. Furthermore, an application demo of the deformed particle cluster passing through a narrow channel highlighted the potential of the proposed system."

    "abstract": "As next-generation data-center interconnects (DCIs) are demanding cost-effective solutions to support high-performance computing, the fiber chromatic dispersion (CD)-induced power fading remains a critical impairment for intensity modulation with direct detection (IM-DD) links. The time-skew enabled vestigial sideband (VSB) scheme can largely mitigate power fading without the need for optical filtering or dispersion compensation. However, its performance remains limited by signal–signal beat interference (SSBI) arising from the square-law detection of the photodiode (PD). In this paper, we establish an analytical model for SSBI under the time-skew enabled VSB modulation framework and propose a circular-based SSBI extraction (CSE) algorithm. The proposed CSE algorithm achieves low computational complexity by solving a simple quadratic equation derived from the analytical model of the received photocurrent. With only 17 additional real-valued multiplications, CSE improves receiver sensitivity by 1 dB with respect to forward equalizer (FFE). Compared to Volterra nonlinear equalizer (VNE), CSE reduces the bit-error rate (BER) by 23% while requiring only 85% of the computational complexity. By employing CSE in the time-skew enabled VSB transmission scheme, we successfully demonstrate 200-Gb/s 4-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) signals transmission over 80-km SSMF within the 20% soft-decision forward error correction (SD-FEC) threshold. The results highlight a promising solution to support higher capacity and greater flexibility in next-generation metro and DCI networks."

    "abstract": "Eddy current brakes (ECBs) are widely used in heavy vehicles because of their excellent noncontact braking characteristics. However, the torque decay is inevitable when ECB is continuously braking, which involves the interaction between electromagnetic field and temperature field. Especially in the extreme condition of high-power continuous braking, there is a serious decline in braking torque, and even the problem of coils insulation burning out due to high temperature. In response to the above issues, this paper proposes a fully water-cooled ECB structure and establishes an electromagnetic-thermal coupling model (ETCM) considering the current decay caused by coils temperature. Through 3D electromagnetic field numerical analysis, the rule of heat generation rate of the stator and the coils was obtained. The temperature distributions of the stator and the coils were calculated by the finite difference method. The average temperature was used to modify three factors of the conductivity, the permeability and the current of the coil in the electromagnetic field model. The simulation and experimental results showed that the ETCM can accurately calculate the thermal decline of the ECB. The proportion of torque decline caused by the three factors is analyzed, among which the conductivity and current have a greater effect on the torque decline. The influence of the coil cooling mode and the wire material on the coils heat dissipation is analyzed. The method of the water-cooled coil is proposed to decrease the torque decline and further optimize the continuous braking performance of ECBs."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach for diagnosing Inter-Turn Short Circuit (ITSC) faults in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs) using a two-layer Interactive Multiple Model (IMM) strategy tailored for real-time applications. The first layer employs an IMM-Constrained Extended Kalman Filter (CEKF) framework for fault detection, while the second layer uses an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) framework for fault diagnosis. In the first layer, four models are employed: the healthy motor model and three models with ITSC faults in each of the PMSM phases. The short-circuit resistance is estimated as an augmented state alongside system states. Upon detecting a fault in one of the phases, the second layer estimates the number of shorted turns and refines the estimated short-circuit resistance value. This study addresses three key challenges in applying the IMM framework to this problem. First, distinguishing between the healthy motor and faulty models with large short-circuit resistances is difficult due to their similar dynamic responses. This issue is resolved by imposing constraints on the estimated resistance, enabling better model separation. Second, the diversity of state variables across models is managed by zero-padding the state vector and estimation error covariance matrix, with matrix-based mode probabilities mitigating errors from augmented zeros. Third, uncertainty in the number of shorted turns is addressed in the second layer by using a secondary model set to determine the exact number of shorted turns and refine the short circuit resistance estimate. Experimental validation, conducted with a custom relay box for controlled fault injection, demonstrates the method's effectiveness in detecting and diagnosing ITSC faults using the first and second model banks, respectively."

    "abstract": "Land surface temperature (LST) serves as a critical biophysical parameter characterizing global-scale surface energy partitioning and water exchange processes. The Split-Window (SW) and Temperature-Emissivity Separation (TES) methods are the most widely used LST retrieval methods, but they rely on accurate land surface emissivity and atmospheric correction as prior knowledge, respectively. While the SW-TES hybrid method mitigates these limitations, atmospheric correction errors in the SW stage can accumulate into the TES stage, thereby affecting the accuracy of LST retrieval. To address this limitation, this study develops an improved SW-TES algorithm that incorporates total column water vapor as a correction factor for surface-leaving radiance calculations. Based on GOES-16 ABI data, we utilized the improved algorithm to retrieve hourly LST estimates for the contiguous United States in 2020 and validated the results against the GOES-16 LST product and ground-based measurements from the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD). The retrieved LST exhibits high consistency with the GOES-16 LST product, demonstrating a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.48 K and a bias of 0.90 K. Based on SURFRAD ground observations, the improved SW-TES algorithm achieves an average RMSE of 2.27 K and a bias of 0.26 K across seven validation sites. In comparison, the GOES-16 LST product shows an RMSE of 2.86 K and a bias of –1.21 K at the same sites. Furthermore, the algorithm maintains superior stability under high temperature and high water vapor content conditions."

    "abstract": "Electromagnetic diffraction of slotted conductive strips is studied using the subdomain method. The subdomain method is based on the Green’s second identity, which decomposes the geometry into partially overlapping subdomains. In each subdomain, the electromagnetic fields are expressed as Fourier–Bessel series. When the field representations in the subdomains are incorporated into the original structure, discontinuities may appear at several interfaces. To address this, we introduce artificial line currents to eliminate the discontinuities. Fourier coefficients are determined by enforcing boundary conditions using the mode-matching method and the orthogonality of sinusoidal functions. To evaluate the accuracy of the subdomain method, we use the root-mean-square error of the surface current density and the bistatic scattering cross section. To assess the computational efficiency, we compare the elapsed time and allocated memory of the subdomain method with those of the finite element method. The numerical results demonstrate that the subdomain method provides solutions for the given geometry with high precision and efficiency."

    "abstract": "The aspiration to replicate the capabilities of the human hand has driven innovations in the design of soft robotic hands. Despite these advancements, many existing designs of soft hands still lack effective in-hand vision and the ability for each finger to achieve active multi-degree-of-freedom motion. This paper proposes a cable-driven soft robotic hand that can achieve dexterous grasping and manipulation, vision-guided grasping, vision-based slip detection and compensation, as well as visually servoed in-hand manipulation. The hand has five soft fingers, each capable of independent flexion/extension motion and bidirectional ad/abduction motion. A red-green-blue-depth (RGB-D) camera is integrated into the palm of the soft hand to enable in-hand vision capability. Modeling of the soft hand is established to analyze its kinematics, statics, and manipulability. A series of experiments are conducted to demonstrate its dexterous grasping and manipulation capabilities on a variety of objects. Using 3D point cloud data from the in-palm camera, an effective vision-guided grasping strategy is developed to grasp objects on a table. The in-hand vision also enables slip detection and compensation during grasping to maintain the grasp stability. Furthermore, a hierarchical, visually servoed controller is developed to perform closed-loop in-hand object manipulation. With its high dexterity and visual feedback capabilities, the soft hand will find important applications such as household object manipulation and food picking/sorting, and may also be used as a prosthetic hand or an auxiliary hand for humans."

However, conventional rigid microrobots face significant challenges in navigating natural orifices, exhibiting limited adaptability and struggling to perform complex biomedical tasks. Flexible magnetic microrobots, while offering better compliance with biological environments, often suffer from poor environmental adaptability, limited controllability in multimodal locomotion and difficulties in integrating actuation and functional operations. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel design strategy combining heterogeneous magnetization and soft-material fabrication techniques to develop two functional microrobots: a quadruped crawling microrobot and a starfish-inspired grasping microrobot. Under the control of a triaxial Helmholtz coil system that generates programmable dynamic magnetic fields, the microrobots demonstrate versatile locomotion modes, including rolling and crawling. A real-time vision-based servo system is integrated to monitor the microrobot's motion and enable autonomous decision-making at branched pathways via predefined motion judgment points. Furthermore, the proposed system supports adaptive mode transitions in response to complex and unstructured environments, paving the way for intelligent operation of flexible microrobots in biomedical scenarios."

Q-var enables low-power and unobtrusive interaction without requiring skin-contact electrodes. Previous work demonstrated that such systems can accurately classify eye movements using onboard TinyML under controlled laboratory conditions. However, the performance and robustness of contactless EOG in real-world scenarios—where environmental noise and user variability are significant—remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a field evaluation of a previously proposed QVar-based eye-tracking system, assessing its limitations in everyday usage contexts across 29 users and 100 recordings in everyday scenarios, such as working in front of a laptop. Our results show that classification accuracy varies between 57% and 89% depending on the user, with an average of 74.5%, degrading significantly in the presence of nearby electronic noise sources. Our experimental results show that contactless EOG remains viable under realistic conditions, though subject variability and environmental factors can significantly affect classification accuracy. The findings inform the future development of wearable gaze interfaces for human-computer interaction and augmented reality, supporting the transition of this technology from prototype to practice."

Key contributions include: 1) A quantum average pooling method for effective information extraction from local TSA data while minimizing the communication overhead of transferring quantum information; 2) A lightweight noise-robustness evaluation method, which, for the first time, applies the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) concept from signal processing to assess the noise robustness of QdTSA-AP, which can be generalized to a wide range of quantum machine learning (QML) tasks; 3) A theoretical proof, based on SNR, showing that average pooling enhances the noise resilience of QVFL through its architectural design rather than requiring additional computational overhead.

All models are then implemented and tested using the standard test system. The results show that, between SED and DED, the DED model proactively dispatches out-of-merit order generators early to minimize the overall dispatch cost by reducing curtailment costs over the planning horizon. In contrast, the myopic nature of SED leads to higher dispatch costs over the entire horizon due to its lack of foresight. Among all four models, SDED demonstrates the best performance under uncertainty, as it effectively captures both uncertainty and look-ahead decision-making capability."

    "abstract": "Power distribution systems and communication networks are inter-dependent. Remote data collection and control of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as windmills, solar panels and battery energy storage systems, employ Smart Meters, Repeaters, Collectors, and Distribution System Operators (DSOs). These devices exchange data through an Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) network. To study this communication network and the impact of a cyber attack on the distribution system, this paper presents two attack scenarios on a cyber-physical power system testbed that uses the Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) and Common Open Research Emulator (CORE). Using realistic load and generation data from SMART-DS synthetic dataset, an Adversary performs a denial-of-service attack (DoS) on the Collector in the first scenario. In the second scenario, the Adversary performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack in the network that connects the Collector to the utility’s DSO. The results show how these attacks impact the integrity of the load values the energy utility receives."

    "abstract": "Locusts exhibit stable jump-flying locomotion with remarkable environmental adaptability. However, prior designs failed to integrate jumping and flying modes effectively due to insufficient kinematic model inspired by the locust, leading to motion instability. In this study, we utilized the Kinovea and MATLAB software to calibrate and analyze the jump-flying data of locusts, revealing that its linear velocity profile exhibits three distinct linear phases. Before flapping their wings, locusts experience a rapid increase in jumping linear velocity. In the ascending stage after flapping their wings, the resistance increases, and the linear velocity decreases slowly. Due to the jumping speed being much greater than the speed required for level flight, the linear velocity further decreases. Subsequently, we conducted simulations grounded in locust motion data. The results demonstrate that the robot's linear velocity profile similarly manifests three distinct linear phases, establishing direct kinematic similarity to locust locomotion. This discovery will enable locust-inspired robots to more accurately replicate biological prototypes, achieving stable and long-time jump-flying locomotion."

All films were deposited onto glass substrates at a fixed temperature of 475°C and constant deposition time of 8 minutes. Structural characterization via X-ray diffraction confirmed the presence of the hexagonal wurtzite structure with a preferred orientation along the (002) plane. Scanning electron microscopy revealed significant changes in surface morphology as a function of milling time, and atomic force microscopy was used to correlate surface morphology with the photocatalytic activity of the synthesized samples. The photocatalytic activity of the films was evaluated by monitoring the degradation of methylene blue under UV irradiation. ZnO films prepared with a precursor milled for 45 minutes exhibited the highest photocatalytic efficiency, suggesting an optimal balance between crystallinity, surface area, and charge carrier dynamics. These results highlight the critical role of precursor milling time in tuning the physicochemical and photocatalytic properties of ZnO thin films for environmental applications."

In this paper, we study and summarize a list of metrics to define and characterize grid strength and discuss their efficacy for small and large signal stability cases. We investigate voltage and frequency at IBR points of interconnection (POI) for different operating conditions in an IEEE test system using a well-known electromagnetic transients simulation platform. Our results show that some advanced metrics indicate stability concerns for a selected IBR integration scheme, while another metric exhibits higher accuracy in determining frequency instability."

However, existing encryption schemes struggle to balance lightweight design with robust security, leading to inefficient data storage. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight assisted encryption scheme that enhances security without compromising device efficiency. Using edge-assisted encryption, the scheme prevents direct server access to user information and alleviates the computational burden on smart devices. Furthermore, the scheme leverages edge servers to assist in generating deduplication tags for the cloud server, facilitating efficient and secure deduplication without revealing the original data. Experimental analysis demonstrates that this scheme offers superior security performance compared to similar systems, while maintaining low computational overhead for AIoT devices."

    "abstract": "With the increasing complexity and data availability in modern power systems, learning-based approaches to AC Optimal Power Flow (AC OPF) have garnered significant attention. In particular, the structure of smart grids lends itself naturally to graph-based representations, where Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can capture spatial and relational dependencies. This paper investigates attention-based GNN architectures tailored to heterogeneous graph representations of electric grids. We evaluate two major paradigms: relational attention, which distinguishes between edge types during message passing, and meta-path attention, which captures high-level semantics through multi-hop, typed paths. Using a large corpus of public AC OPF scenarios, we benchmark representative models of each type of attention. Our results demonstrate the benefits of heterogeneous attention-based models in accurately capturing grid dynamics; heterogeneous attention models achieve superior performance in both standard and perturbed settings. The findings highlight the importance of semantic-aware architectures for improving prediction robustness and interpretability in power system applications."

In particular, RISC-V has offered hardware designers the possibility of designing processors in a much cheaper way by leveraging a rich ecosystem of open-source designs that can be easily reused, extended, and customized. Although the RISC-V ecosystem is rapidly growing and open-source processors are becoming increasingly sophisticated, some advanced architectural techniques typically employed in commercial high-performance processors are still not prevalent in RISC-V open-source architectures. Among them, hardware prefetchers have been ubiquitous in highend processors for many years, but they are not as commonly found in open-source RISC-V processors. To bridge this gap, this work presents FetchFlare, a stride prefetcher for highperformance cache hierarchies. FetchFlare is able to capture the memory access patterns of applications, predict future memory accesses, and issue prefetch requests for them. We provide an open-source RTL implementation of FetchFlare and integrate it into a complete open-source setup formed by the OpenPiton framework, the Sargantana core, and the High-Performance Data Cache (HPDCache). Compared to a baseline system without prefetching, FetchFlare achieves an average speedup of $63 \\%$, avoids cache misses in the L1D and the L2 caches, and presents an average accuracy, coverage, and timeliness of $86 \\%, 39 \\%$, and 99%, respectively."

    "abstract": "One of the main methods of decarbonization cited at the moment is known as \"green hydrogen\", or the production of hydrogen, or hydrogen carriers, via the process of electrolysis, which may then be turned back into energy via the use of fuel cells. One potential site for this which can have a great deal of potential is Alaskan hydroelectric sites. Alaskan dams, like others in the Pacific Northwest region, spill significantly during Summer and still have enough reserves to power their entire community on almost exclusively hydroelectric sources. Spilled water represents lost potential energy that could instead be stored seasonally or used in other applications, such as marine or automotive fuels. They have a large potential reserve in their dams, each of which spills significantly from the months of June to December, and are capable of producing between 230 and 3300 metric tons of ammonia, well over their current consumption levels, and a large number of small docks which may benefit from a cheaper, locally sourced fuel, from which to build a potential market. This paper looks into broader uses, as well as into potential evaluation schema based on Bernoulli’s principle to determine the spill amount over a full year. The aforementioned metric tons of ammonia could drive between $100,000 to $1,600,000 in additional yearly revenue to the utility, depending on the system installed."

The IBRs are equipped with either grid-following (GFL) or grid-forming (GFM) control strategies. Four testbeds have been built and compared for their performance when the HPP is subjected to weak grid conditions and low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) scenarios. The results reveal that when only GFL-IBRs are deployed, there are notable limitations and operational constraints under these challenging conditions. However, when some of the IBRs are replaced by GFM-IBRs, the system demonstrates significantly improved robustness. The operational limits become broader, and the system’s ride-through capabilities are enhanced, offering smoother performance after fault-clearing. The retrofitted controller is a fairly new virtual admittance based GFM control emulating a voltage source behind an impedance. The simulation is performed in PSCAD and data acquisition and graphical representation was done using MATLAB."

    "abstract": "The reliable performance prediction and health-aware control in battery management systems (BMS) require accurate calibration and tracking of battery model parameters. Battery ageing and operating under varying temperature and load conditions cause internal parameters such as ohmic resistance, dynamic polarization, and diffusion elements to keep changing over time, limiting the effectiveness of static parameter models. This work presents an application and a comparative study of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for real-time calibration of second-order (2RC) and third-order (3RC) battery equivalent circuit models (ECMs). A unified nonlinear state-space framework is developed to jointly estimate model parameters across multiple time constants, capturing transient and long-term dynamics that reflect battery degradation. The model parameters are assessed across a range of perturbations and noise levels to estimate accuracy and robustness. Results show that, when properly tuned, EKF and UKF can effectively track health-sensitive parameters. This work formulates a scalable approach for moderately high-order ECMs, facilitating aging-aware diagnostics and predictive control for high-end battery applications in the future."

This work presents a fully hardware-integrated 1 Gbps Ethernet-based DAQ system implemented on an Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA. The design replaces the VME back-end with a memory-mapped TCP/IP interface and an optional streaming mode, enabling deterministic, real-time data transmission without embedded processors. The system was validated using real detector signals from a µRWELL chamber, with successful capture of cosmic events and multi-channel charge readout. Benchmarking confirms reliable multi-word transactions over TCP and a sustained streaming throughput of up to 100 MB/s using generated data.

However, generalizing machine learning models for various grid topologies and attack strategies faces tremendous obstacles. To overcome the research gaps, we introduce PING, a physics-informed graph neural network to generalize FDIA localization. We encode physical properties and measurements into node and edge features of a graph and leverage self-attention neural networks to generalize knowledge from various power grids. Furthermore, we introduce a mask variable into the node/edge features to explicitly indicate measurement availability that accidents or cyberattacks can disrupt. These original designs enable an inductive learning capability that makes PING automatically adaptive to various power grids and attack strategies without runtime retraining. Our evaluation integrating real operation data in eight IEEE test systems demonstrates that PING can accurately localize FDIAs, i.e., 97% accuracy on average with complete measurements and 88% accuracy even with 40% missing measurements. More importantly, its performance can maintain 95% accuracy when the model is tested in completely different power grids."

To address this challenge, we propose implementing a smart vehicle tracking system leveraging GSM and GPS technologies. This project entails the integration of a low-cost Arduino microcontroller with a combined GPS and GSM module. Of significance is the incorporation of an offline GPS tracking feature using an Android Mobile Application, implementing a novel approach of displaying the ambulance location and ETA on a map - without the use of internet.

    "abstract": "An ice-embedded irradiance profiler was developed for autonomous, in situ observations of solar irradiance distribution within sea ice, potentially over a seasonal scale. This profiler employs a transparent tube embedded within the ice to transmit the solar radiation signal from the ice to the tube. It utilizes a spectrometer, capable of moving up and down within the tube, to measure the solar irradiance signal at various ice depths. The temperature dependence of the spectrometer was investigated across a temperature range from −50°C to +25°C. In addition, a dark output prediction model was developed with an overall prediction uncertainty of ±2.5%. A signal output correction model was also proposed to correct the temperature-induced bias in the spectrometer readings, and this was further incorporated into the calibration of the profiler’s output. A prototype of the profiler was deployed in 160-cm-thick Arctic ice during the 13th Chinese National Arctic Scientific Expedition, where it measured the downwelling irradiance distribution in the sea ice at 13 different depths over 35 days. The overall performance of the profiler was validated, and the obtained optical properties of the sea ice are comparable to those measured by other commercially available optical sensors."

    "abstract": "Due to the specific characteristics of underwater channels and the hostile ocean environment, it is challenging to provide reliable data transmissions in underwater acoustic communication networks (UACNs). Multipath routing (MR) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance transmission reliability by leveraging redundant paths to transmit data concurrently. However, MR is prone to cross-path interference, which will degrade transmission latency performance. To this end, this paper proposes an interference-avoidance and low-latency cross-layer multipath routing (ILMR) protocol to address the tradeoff between reliability and latency in MR. Specifically, ILMR considers the transmission latency as the optimization objective and formulates a constrained optimization problem that jointly optimizes path selection at the network layer and transmission scheduling at the medium access control layer. By cross-layer joint design, ILMR can reduce cross-path interference and achieve reliable MR with lower latency in UACNs. Furthermore, unlike most previous works on routing for UACNs that are only verified through simulations, we have also carried out field experiments, including an experiment in Minghui Lake, and a sea trial near Dongju Island in the Zhoushan Archipelago. Experimental results show that the proposed cross-layer MR scheme can improve network performance. Specifically, the transmission latency performance is reduced by about 30% and the packet delivery ratio performance is increased by about 5%."

To date, high-transmittance single-mode waveguiding in a single optical nanofiber in the full visible spectral range remains challenging. Here, by using a commercially available silica fiber with a single-mode cut-off wavelength smaller than 400 nm (Nufern, 405-HP) as the fiber preform, and taper-drawing the fiber into a nanofiber with a standard fabrication technique, we show that the nanofiber can support broadband single-mode waveguiding with high optical transmittance in the full visible spectral range. Quantitatively, a silica nanofiber with a uniform diameter between 210 and 270 nm can support single-mode optical waveguiding with transmittance higher than 96% (i.e., less than 0.18 dB in loss) from 400 to 800-nm wavelength. Such a broadband single-mode nanofiber may find applications including near-field optical coupling, optical interconnection, optical sensing, atom optics and fiber lasers in the broad visible spectral range."

    "abstract": "Integrated pipeline-valve-vessel systems are essential in industrial processes but require periodic disassembly for inspection under extreme conditions. Robotic inspection offers an economical and efficient alternative to manual disassembly. However, existing robots are limited to inspecting pipelines or vessels separately. Continuous traversal through small-to-medium diameter pipelines (80–150 mm), valves, and into vessels remains challenging due to irregular and confined chambered structure. To overcome this limitation, we propose a chain-type magnetic wheeled robot featuring two key innovations: 1) the integration of a serial gear chain (SGC) with magnetic adhesion mechanism ensures the robot’s adaptability to irregular surfaces, reducing force-control dependency during complex valve navigation. Leveraging this characteristic, a distributed dual-end drive configuration within the SGC addresses power insufficiency caused by the robot’s suspension in the hollow regions and 2) the traditional force-angle stability margin is modified to serve as a criterion for tipover instability. Based on this, a predictive instability control framework is developed, integrating offline-computed posture thresholds with real-time attitude monitoring to enhance motion stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the robot achieves robust, stable traversal, and nondismantling inspection across pipelines, valves, and vessels without disassembly. This work provides valuable insights for industries, such as nuclear power and chemical engineering."

    "abstract": "Annealing processors (APs), which can efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), have attracted attention. APs that have fully-coupled spin coupling are the focus of active research due to their ability to handle a wide range of COPs. However, since a single spin is updated by referring to the states of all other spins, sequential spin updates are necessary. This makes it difficult to achieve both faster computation time and stable solution quality. We propose transition-based multi-state pseudo annealing (TMSPA), which is an annealing method that enables discrete spin states between ±1 and maps the conventional two spin states to different transition directions. By using TMSPA, we solved the Max-cut problem and the traveling salesman problem (TSP). We found that TMSPA enables all-parallel annealing for both COPs. In terms of solution quality, TMSPA performed comparably to or better than simulated annealing and pseudo annealing. For the TSP, TMSPA reached better minimum values with less than one-third the number of Monte Carlo steps than previous all-parallel annealing methods. We also propose an all-parallelized annealing processing system using TMSPA. By using the proposed system with 1024- and 2048-spin configurations, we achieved better solution quality and 6.25 times faster computation time while operating at half the frequency and limiting the increase in circuit-resource utilization to 1.03–5.70 times compared with a previous parallelized AP. This result indicates that reducing circuit complexity using TMSPA is highly effective in the implementation of parallelized APs."

With the advanced synthesis-aided design theories and high-precision MEMS technology, filters with sophisticated structures can be manufactured without post-production tuning. Physical realization of NRN modules based on the MEMS platform is proposed to produce TZs at desired frequencies. Additionally, the intrinsic dispersion effects of the MEMS structures can be employed to form frequency-dependent couplings (FDCs), thus generating extra TZs in the upper stopband. In this way, multiple TZs can be specified to enhance selectivity and attenuation under the inline configuration. Moreover, to address the strong interference between adjacent modules, parasitic couplings are added to the modified circuit prototype, and the corresponding synthesis method is presented. Aided by the updated circuit, the geometry dimensions can be refined to recover the filter response from the unavoidable parasitic effects. The design and synthesis theories are demonstrated via multiple examples. Two inline MEMS filters with TZs are fabricated and measured to verify the developed theories and technologies."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the deployment of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for source localization has significantly increased in military, civil, and commercial domains. The transmission of data from the source to each UAV introduces channel noise, which affects localization accuracy. Furthermore, since direct estimation of time of arrival is impractical, signal processing at a central UAV is essential to estimate time difference of arrival to achieve a precise source localization. This processed localization information is subsequently shared among the UAV network. However, transmitting original data to a central point presents challenges due to its time-consuming and low energy efficiency, and highlights the importance of efficient data compression in multiple UAV systems. Consequently, it is recommended that low-dimensional data be transmitted across UAV networks instead of the original high-dimensional signal samples to realize the reconstruction of the original data for source localization. However, as the compression rate (CR) increases, accurately reconstructing the original data becomes challenging. This paper proposes a deep denoising autoencoder (DAE) approach for high-ratio data compression in multiple UAV systems. The DAE not only effectively reduces noise from signals but also significantly decreases the volume of data required for transmission, enabling accurate reconstruction of the original data. Simulations were performed to assess the localization accuracy of the proposed DAE approach. The results indicate that the approach achieves high localization accuracy, particularly in challenging scenarios of low signal-to-noise and high CRs."

A voltage severity index is introduced to assist system operators in the planning and programming of capacitors. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on a real large copper mine network in Iran, equipped with sensitive loads to voltage sags and doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs). The results indicate that the control mode of DFIGs and their output power influence the optimal location and size of capacitors. The proposed capacitor placement method enhances voltage profiles, reduces total harmonic distortion, minimizes grid losses, and lowers the costs associated with capacitors. Furthermore, the results underscore the necessity of selecting the appropriate control method based on the system’s operational priorities and conditions. The proposed capacitor placement method successfully reduced financial losses due to voltage sags up to 62%, leading to more secure operation of sensitive loads."

However, the existing GNN-based network models are designed to predict only a single performance metric at a time, leading to computational inefficiencies. Moreover, existing approaches lack effective methodologies for interpreting the learned relationships in a networking context. We present MHNet, a multi-head GNN architecture capable of simultaneously predicting delay, jitter, and packet loss in network traffic flows. To train MHNet, we propose an adaptive optimization strategy that constructs a balanced update direction to update the weights of the model at each epoch using the normalized gradients of the individual loss functions correspond to performance metric outputs. To interpret the relationships learned by the model in the network graph, we construct a gradient-based analysis framework that integrates networking domain knowledge to assess the influence of input features on the prediction outputs. Experimental results show that MHNet achieves prediction accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art RouteNet model across all metrics, while reducing inference-stage Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) cost by 67%. The interpretation analysis further reveals that MHNet mitigates oversmoothing and selectively focuses on the most relevant substructures of the network feature graph when predicting performance metrics for traffic flows."

This paper presents a modified Taylor weighting method for curved sources and conformal arrays. First, it is demonstrated that a curved source is equivalent to a three-dimensional (3D) virtual source. Thus, the Taylor pattern of curved sources can be established using the pattern of virtual 3D sources. Subsequently, a correlation model between the Taylor pattern of a curved source or a conformal array and its Taylor distribution is determined using the iterative least squares (ILS) method. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified via numerical examples and experiments."

To address these issues, we construct a real-world university classroom behavior dataset and propose SEP-YOLO, an improved YOLOv10n-based model. First, to mitigate complex background interference, we introduce the Edge Fusion Scale Attention (EFSA) module into the backbone network, enhancing the model’s ability to perceive student motion contours and boundary features.

Experimental results demonstrate that SEP-YOLO effectively applies to classroom behavior recognition tasks, outperforming Faster R-CNN, YOLOv5n, and YOLOv8n in handling complex background interference and small-object detection.

However, the influence of the underwater assist suit on the divers’ body was not investigated. Therefore, in this study, the influence of the underwater assist suit on the divers’ body was analyzed using the musculoskeletal model analysis software “AnyBody Modeling System”.

    "abstract": "Space-Terrestrial Integrated Networks (STINs) are emerging as a key architecture for providing seamless global connectivity in future 6 G networks. However, the dynamic nature of satellite topologies challenges the continuity of service request routing. Most existing algorithms only consider routing within a single timeslot, leading to frequent path switching and service disruptions. In this paper, we propose a Path Duration-Aware routing scheme that explicitly considers the duration time a routing path remains valid to support service requests with defined duration time. By assuming that each service request has a specific arrival time and duration time, a routing path may not be able to sustain the completion of a service request due to changes in satellite network topology. In the proposed scheme, the goal is to allocate routes that persist across multiple timeslots, enhancing service continuity and reducing rerouting overhead. For the set of service requests in each time slot including newly arrived and required rerouting service requests, a path selection scheme is designed that tries to allocate the path that can support service requests for the longest duration time. We implement the service request routing scheme based on an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme is efficient for routing service request in STINs."

We present the first implementation and evaluation of the Evict+Spec+Time attack on RISC-V, previously demonstrated only on x86 [2]. This advanced variant of Evict+Time integrates three critical phases: eviction, speculation, and timing. First, the attack forcibly evicts target cache lines using RISC-V’s cbo.flush instruction via the Zicbom extension [6]. Next, it exploits out-of-order execution to manipulate microarchitectural resources such as the reorder buffer, limiting the processor’s ability to mask cache-miss latency. Finally, it infers secret-dependent memory access patterns through precise timing measurements. We validate RISC-V’s vulnerability by recovering secret keys from AES T-table implementations. Using the gem5 simulator [4], we provide the first detailed analysis of microarchitectural behavior during the attack, including cache contention, pipeline stalls, and latency variations. These insights establish foundational guidance for developing RISC-V-specific countermeasures against such attacks."

This paper proposes a Spatial-Temporal Long Short-Term Memory (ST-LSTM) framework for real-time FDIA detection that jointly captures temporal dynamics and spatial correlations in AC power systems. To improve scalability in large networks, we introduce a symbolic decomposition technique that exploits the functional structure of AC power flow equations to construct a sparse spatial recurrence graph, enabling efficient localized information propagation without requiring access to line parameters. This structure-aware formulation enhances ST-LSTM’s ability to generalize under spatial and temporal distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on IEEE benchmark systems with realistic load profiles demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches across a range of dynamic scenarios."

    "abstract": "Malware poses a serious challenge to the security of network environments. Given the concealment and diversity of malware, accurate analysis has become extremely difficult. Machine learning and deep learning methods, such as random forest algorithms and convolutional neural networks, are widely adopted in malware analysis because of their excellent feature extraction capabilities. However, these methods struggle to capture the complex relationships between malware’s deep features and are challenging to adapt to classes with only a small number of samples. In this work, we propose an analysis method for malware attack behavior based on deep feature characterization. In our scheme, we first visualize the binary files of malware to more intuitively display their features. Subsequently, we use a large amount of unlabeled data to conduct contrast training, resulting in an AutoEncoder capable of characterizing the deep generalization features of malware. Finally, we employ a neural network to classify the outputs of the encoder, which significantly improves the classification effectiveness. We evaluated our method on the Malimg dataset, and the experimental results indicate that the classification accuracy of our method can reach over $97 \\%$, with good classification performance across various types of malware."

    "abstract": "The Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is a fundamental operation in privacy-preserving technologies, particularly within fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). The efficiency of NTT computation directly impacts the overall performance of FHE, making hardware acceleration a critical technology that will enable realistic FHE applications. Custom accelerators, in FPGAs or ASICs, offer significant performance advantages due to their ability to exploit massive parallelism and specialized optimizations. However, the operation of NTT over large moduli requires large word-length modulo arithmetic that limits achievable clock frequencies in hardware and increases hardware area costs. To overcome such deficits, digit-serial arithmetic has been explored for modular multiplication and addition independently. The goal of this work is to leverage digit-serial modulo arithmetic combined with appropriate redundant data representation to design modular pipelined NTT accelerators that operate uniformly on arbitrary small digits, without the need for intermediate (de)serialization. The proposed architecture enables high clock frequencies through regular pipelining while maintaining parallelism. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art implementations and reduces hardware complexity under equal performance and input-output bandwidth constraints."

First, a high-fidelity hydrodynamic model is established through computational fluid dynamics (CFD)driven parameterization. Then a hierarchical control framework combining model predictive control (MPC) and fuzzy logic control (FLC) is proposed to address nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions, environmental uncertainties, and actuator mapping complexities. The upper-layer MPC optimizes reference forces and moments via receding horizon optimization, while the lower-layer FLC adaptively translates these references into actuator-specific commands through fuzzy rule-based signal allocation. Finally, comparative simulations in a U-shaped and 8-shaped path following task demonstrate the proposed strategy's superiority, achieving a 70 % reduction in average crosstrack error and 50% faster convergence than conventional PID and sliding mode controllers under randomized hydrodynamic disturbances."

    "abstract": "Modeling dynamical systems is essential for understanding complex systems, particularly when the governing equations are either unavailable or inadequately parameterized, making it challenging to derive analytical models. Traditional system identification techniques primarily rely on input-output data; however, recent advancements in machine learning, particularly deep learning, have created new opportunities for modeling such systems. Despite their potential, deep learning models often suffer from limited interpretability, susceptibility to overfitting, and inconsistencies with physical laws. Incorporating prior knowledge of system physics into deep learning models has shown promise in mitigating these issues, yet identifying and effectively embedding such knowledge remains challenging. This paper proposes a robust alternative using a random forest regression (RFR) to model the system dynamics. The results demonstrate that by training the model using lagged endogenous and exogenous features, a Random Forest Regressor can achieve around 82.5% reduction in prediction error compared to an advanced deep learning model trained using knowledge of system physics. This approach is computationally efficient and highly effective, as demonstrated through its application to modeling the temporal dynamics of a gas turbine generator. These findings highlight the potential of classical machine learning techniques, such as a Random Forest Regressor, as an efficient alternative for modeling complex dynamical systems."

    "abstract": "The increasing penetration of wind and photovoltaic (PV) presents significant challenges to existing power systems. High levels of wind and PV integration introduce stability concerns due to the inherent variability when controlled to track peak power output and the resulting short-term uncertainty in their power output. This has underscored the growing importance of providing dynamically controllable real and reactive power to maintain grid stability. The static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) is a well-established solution for enhancing voltage and system stability through fast and precise reactive power control. In this study, a shunt compensator based on a modular multilevel converter (MMC)-based STATCOM is proposed for reactive power compensation. Most new STATCOM installations use delta connected MMC topologies. Energy storage can be added to the dc side of the MMC in the form of supercapacitors, creating E-STATCOM. A double-wye MMC topology is more suitable for adding storage on the dc side of the MMC, and that topology is used in this paper. A modified version of the IEEE 12-bus system is modeled and simulated using an electromagnetic transient simulator to evaluate its dynamic response under various operating conditions, both without compensation and with the proposed STATCOM. The simulation results confirm that integrating the MMC-based STATCOM substantially improves system voltage by effectively suppressing voltage fluctuations and meeting reactive power requirements. To ensure voltage regulation at the point of common coupling (PCC), the reactive power output of the STATCOM was calculated, demonstrating its ability to dynamically respond to changing system conditions and maintain voltage levels within acceptable operational limits."

    "abstract": "Despite the potential implications, knowledge about quantifying the increase in electric demand due to growing electric vehicle (EV) adoption in New York State is limited. In this study, we derive annual demand from EVs using projected stocks from NYISO and current stocks from NYSERDA, leveraging a concept known as Fractional Vehicle Miles Traveled. We develop three scenarios, including a slower adoption scenario based on socioeconomic factors, and a faster scenario based on state emissions reduction mandates. For each scenario, we disaggregated annual demand into monthly and diurnal profiles per zone, using separate profiles for different vehicle types. We project significant increases in annual electric consumption solely from EVs in most load zones, exceeding 5 GWh in the highest-demand zones in downstate New York. We show that significant penetration of EVs will amplify the current peak total intraday loads driven by other demand sources, which occur in the late afternoons and early evenings. In some zones, this was as much as 1250 MW when aggregated on peak demand for a recent heat wave event. These results are critical for future grid management, especially in the era of increasing frequency of extreme weather events and the electrification of other demand features."

    "abstract": "With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various scenarios, the issue of their security is increasingly drawing attention. Although these models are powerful, they are also vulnerable to malicious exploitation, such as bypassing security mechanisms to generate harmful content or executing unauthorized operations. Therefore, ensuring the security of LLMs is crucial for maintaining network security and user trust. To address this issue, we propose a multi-stage defense framework called EssenceGuard, aimed at enhancing the security of LLMs through essence analysis. The core of the EssenceGuard is essence analysis, which includes two main stages: intent analysis and strategy analysis. In the intent analysis stage, it aims to detect whether the user input attempts to mask the true intent, such as using indirect language, fictional scenarios, or other mask methods. In the strategy analysis stage, further analysis is conducted on the specific strategies that might have been used, such as encoding conversion, metaphor, or fictional scenarios. By combining the results of these two stages of analysis, EssenceGuard can more accurately assess the risk of user input and generate more secure responses. EssenceGuard introduces in-context learning and complex evaluation logic to maintain a low Attack Success Rate (ASR) while reducing the False Positive Rate (FPR) for benign user queries. Additionally, EssenceGuard provides a transparent feedback mechanism to explain to users why their queries are judged to be harmful or harmless, thereby enhancing user trust. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the EssenceGuard framework and show the framework excels in detecting malicious attacks and reducing false positive rate."

The TNGM can be constructed using synchrophasor measurements from substations without requiring any prior knowledge of network connectivity. This study explores the application of quantum-inspired integer particle swarm optimization (QI-IPSO) to construct TNGMs. The QI-IPSO algorithm efficiently searches for an optimal graph that replicates the underlying transmission network. Furthermore, QI-IPSO improves convergence and accuracy compared to classical IPSO. The quantum-inspired search algorithm guides PSO particles more effectively in the search space to arrive at the optimal TNGM. The performance of QI-IPSO for constructing TNGMs is illustrated on a two-area four-machine test power system. Typical results show that QI-IPSO constructs the TNGM accurately in fewer iterations and faster than IPSO. This study highlights the potential of quantum-inspired AI algorithms for EPTN modeling, particularly as the network size and complexity grow."

Their ability to perform load-following operations is critical for ensuring grid reliability in systems with high shares of variable energy resources, such as wind and solar. This paper presents a seasonal assessment of SMR load-following capabilities using forecasted load demand profiles obtained from hybrid deep learning models. Multiple forecasting models were evaluated to first identify the most accurate short-term electricity load demand forecast model. A hybrid deep learning model based on the combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), i.e., hybrid CNN+BiLSTM, achieved the best performance by generating more accurate week-ahead load forecasts based on historical temperature and load data. These forecasts were used to simulate the response of a dynamic SMR model developed in Simulink, incorporating realistic ramp-rate and control constraints. Performance of the models is evaluated across four seasonal scenarios and test results show that the SMR is able to effectively track forecasted load profiles year-round, with Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) below 1.5%. These findings demonstrate the potential of forecast-informed SMR operation as a reliable and dispatchable clean energy solution for future grid architectures."

It requires no prior training data, ensuring suitability for real-time use with traceable computational time. The model also incorporates diverse state variables, including weather, electrical, and mechanical conditions of the line, enhancing robustness. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through integration into a real-time, multi-interval Security-Constrained Optimal Power Flow (SCOPF) problem, using a modified IEEE 24-bus system. The problem is solved both as a Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP) model using Gurobi and as a nonlinear model using the Interior Point Optimizer (IPOPT). The proposed testbed incorporates modern grid technologies such as energy storage units and distributed renewable energy generation. Case studies show improved accuracy, reduced operational costs and renewable curtailment, and effective real-time market balancing."

    "abstract": "This study proposes a hybrid framework that integrates advanced clustering techniques with deep learning models, designed to exploit very high temporal resolution data in order to increase the accuracy of short- and medium-term forecasts. The main objective is to demonstrate that the incorporation of clustering processes makes it possible to identify daily atmospheric variability, seasonality or other dynamic transitions, which in turn allows the training of more robust specialized models. A database with 10 -second resolution was used under varied weather conditions. The results show that the application of clustering optimizes data segmentation, facilitating more effective learning, improving the predictive capacity of the algorithms used. In terms of performance, it was observed that the clustered models outperformed the reference models (without clustering), reaching improvements in <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$R^{2}$</tex> of up to 0.005 in short-term forecasts and an average of 0.031 for the medium term. Likewise, relative improvements were recorded in prediction errors: the MAE decreased on average by 18.79 % for the short term and 42.97 % for the medium term, while the RMSE showed average reductions of 8.37 % and 41.88 %, respectively, as well as a reduction in processing time of an average of 6.47 % for short-term predictions (robust method) and an average of 83 % for medium-term forecasts (less complex method). These findings demonstrate that high granularity and clustering bring considerable practical value in critical applications such as: (i) power availability estimation by time slots, (ii) intelligent programming of battery storage systems, and (iii) energy planning in PV systems."

A security model about searchable encryption with leakage resilience is put forward, and the first searchable encryption scheme against side channel attacks is proposed.

However, less emphasis has been given to handling perturbations in the model. In the context of linear state estimation (LSE), which is the focus of this paper, perturbations in the model come from variations in the line parameters. Since the actual values of the line parameters can be different from the values stored in a power utility’s database, we investigate three approaches in this paper to estimate the states in the presence of bounded uncertainties in the data and the model. The first approach is based on interval arithmetic, the second is based on convex optimization, and the third is based on generalized linear-fractional programming. The three algorithms are applied to multiple IEEE test systems and compared in terms of their speed and accuracy. The results indicate that the first two algorithms are extremely fast and give expected results, while the third suffers from scalability issues and is unsuitable for LSE."

Testing on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets showed quantum SVM achieving 70.6% accuracy on adversarial data, outperforming classical SVM with RBF which achieved $51 \\%$.

The results suggest that WECs do not significantly enhance or degrade grid stability, thus confirming their potential for seamless integration into renewable energy grids.

Although increasing resource capacity inherently improves microgrid resilience during emergencies, this study addresses the critical balance between resilience requirements and associated costs. The proposed method considers multiple dimensions of resilience measurement and aims to optimize investments for emergency scenarios. By integrating Fixed Battery Energy Storage Systems (FBESS) and Mobile Battery Energy Storage Systems (MBESS), the strategy provides adaptability, making the microgrid both resilient and cost-effective. The approach is tested in three practical resilience scenarios: low, moderate, and high, each reflecting different levels of critical load coverage and solar availability. This illustrates how the method adapts to the varying demands of the system while maintaining resilience without incurring unnecessary costs. The results highlight the importance of considering cost and resilience as dual objectives in microgrid planning and operation, providing valuable information to grid operators and planners seeking to improve system resilience while optimizing resource allocation."

    "abstract": "Blind source separation (BSS) is a widely discussed research area in signal processing that aims to separate source signals from observed or mixed signals. This study utilizes Gaussian filtering to smooth well-defined mixed signals commonly found in communication signals. A simplified cost function based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is adopted, and the demixing matrix is obtained by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem without iterations. Gaussian filtering, also known as Gaussian smoothing (GS), effectively eliminates Gaussian noise and outlier effects by employing weighted averages of data points. This results in a modified data set with reduced frequency and magnitude of outliers. The proposed algorithm is straightforward to implement and is evaluated through simulation experiments involving communication signals of the same frequency, different frequencies, and various modulations in a visible light communication (VLC) system. Additionally, other commonly used independent component analysis (ICA) algorithms are introduced for comparative analysis. The study also investigates the algorithm’s performance as the number of sources increases. The simulation results demonstrate the proposed algorithm’s favorable performance, particularly in scenarios with high SNR."

In Japan, professional sports such as baseball and soccer use data-based player evaluation methods and strategies, but in handball, many teams evaluate, select, and direct their players based on traditional knowledge and past experience. Sabermetrics is a method of analysis in baseball. Since baseball plays are separated by each pitch and the open data of handball is play-by-play data, we considered that it has a high affinity with sabermetrics. In this study, we apply the sabermetric index. Specifically, we propose an evaluation index that focuses on players who increase the probability of winning a game by using their play-by-play data. In the field of handball, there have been few studies based on data concerning player evaluation as far as the authors have investigated."

As the majority of COTS ICs are susceptible to radiation effects, particularly Micro-Single-Event-Latchups (μ-SELs) and SELs, COTS systems are likewise vulnerable. We had proposed a protection means involving the deployment of an AI-based μ-SEL/SEL detection on the input power rail (external to the COTS system) – hence, without needing physical modification to the COTS system. However, the input power rail’s R/C/L configuration, which varies across different COTS systems, obscures μ-SEL/SEL characteristics, thereby degrading detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose an improved AI-based μ-SEL/SEL detection approach that integrates R/C/L-aware data augmentation and temporal feature extraction to improve its robustness against R/C/L-induced distortions. We achieve high (86.6%) detection accuracy across different R/C/L configurations – improving by 23.4%-73.5% over prior works. Our proposed approach is hence appropriate for space applications, facilitating our said envisioned \"Chang’s Next Paradigm of New Space\"."

After preprocessing and patch extraction, data were categorized into nodule and non-nodule classes. To extract features, we used six pretrained CNN architectures (ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, DenseNet121, and InceptionV3). For feature training, traditional classifiers Support Vector Machines (SVM), and XGBoost were then utilized. We employed data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization and prevent overfitting. The most accurate pipeline we encountered utilized ResNet50 with SVM and reached 98% accuracy. These results demonstrate the benefits of using deep feature extraction alongside conventional machine-learning classifiers, and highlight the effectiveness and robustness of an easily adoptable approach to lung nodule detection in medical imaging."

Then we train a switching model to achieve smooth switching between walking and standing. After training in simulation, we deploy the model on a real humanoid robot. We bridge the gap between simulation and reality by combining visual characteristics for the robot state estimation. Thus, the humanoid robot can move stably on complex terrains with straightened legs, including walking in different directions, adapting to external disturbances, and standing still on discrete obstacles and slopes. Straight-leg locomotion is more human-like and can reduce 23% motor torques."

However, gird restrictions affect the full capability of electric aircraft fleet. As part of NASA’s Advanced Air Mobility Mission, this study presents a mathematical model and a solution methodology which can create a flight schedule for eVTOLs in order to determine (i) passenger flows, and (ii) infrastructure requirements based on estimated travel demands, while (iii) analyzing the grid to maintain stability and security requirements.

This new type of joint electro-hydraulic actuator can achieve a large swinging angle and a fast dynamic response speed. In addition, the crawling robot developed by using this joint actuator can not only realize fast crawling speed (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$3.3 \\text{BL} / \\mathrm{s}$</tex>) but also perform climbing motion at an angle of 30°.

    "abstract": "Online recruitment platforms have transformed talent acquisition, yet they suffer from high candidate attrition: industry reports suggest that nearly 70 % of applicants abandon digital application forms before submission. Such dropout not only drains talent pipelines but also creates inefficiencies for recruiters. While predictive analytics has been applied to churn and dropout in domains like e-commerce and education, its systematic use in recruitment remains limited. This study introduces a data-driven framework for predicting candidate dropout using artificial intelligence techniques tailored to recruitment contexts. Leveraging a real-world dataset of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2 4, 0 0 0}$</tex> job-application sessions, we integrate behavioral telemetry, user history, and job-posting metadata into a unified machinelearning pipeline. Five classifiers-Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost, and LightGBM-were benchmarked. Gradient-boosted trees achieved the best results, with LightGBM reaching an F1-score of 0.76, precision of 0.79, and recall of 0.74, outperforming other methods across multiple random splits. Beyond performance, the framework emphasizes interpretability and fairness, crucial for AI systems in regulated hiring environments. SHAP analysis revealed that interaction-level features such as time per step, page revisits, and overall session length are the most influential predictors of dropout, offering transparent insights into candidate disengagement. By combining predictive accuracy with explainability, this work provides both a baseline and a roadmap for building human-centered recruitment platforms that move from passive monitoring to proactive candidateretention strategies. The study highlights how AI can not only predict dropout but also guide the design of real-time interventions, adaptive user interfaces, and fairer recruitment processes."

Predictive failure monitoring has emerged as a promising approach to anticipate imminent failures and enable preventive or mitigation actions before outages occur. This paper provides a broad survey of predictive failure monitoring techniques in distributed systems. We survey the data sources and failure indicators utilized, ranging from system logs and performance metrics to sensor readings, and analyze the machine learning methods applied, ranging from classical supervised classifiers to advanced deep learning and ensemble models. We subsequently review representative proactive frameworks that integrate failure prediction with automated failure avoidance or recovery mechanisms. In addition, we discuss the evaluation metrics used to assess the effectiveness of the prediction and the impact of the system. Finally, after highlighting current challenges (data imbalance, operational overhead, and adaptability), we outline promising future research directions toward more robust and intelligent failure prediction in distributed computing environments. This work demonstrates measurable reductions in downtime, improved service availability, and reduced operational costs across various platforms, confirming the practical benefits of predictive monitoring in real-world systems."

    "abstract": "Cancer treatment faces significant challenges due to tumor adaptation, heterogeneity, and rapid resistance development, where sequential therapies often fail against the evolving dynamics of cancer cells. Traditional methods, such as fixed-dose regimens, overlook the adaptive, game-like interactions between oncologists and tumors, leading to suboptimal outcomes and limited personalization in precision medicine. To address these limitations, we introduce Nash-RL, an innovative framework that integrates game theory and reinforcement learning (RL) to enable optimized, evolutionarily informed cancer therapy. By modeling the oncologist-tumor interaction as a Stackelberg game, where the oncologist acts as an RL-trained leader optimizing strategies and the tumor as an evolutionary follower adapting to pressures, our approach anticipates resistance mechanisms and captures the sequential decision-making process inherent in adaptive treatments. Nash-RL combines key game-theoretic concepts, including Nash equilibrium, Stackelberg strategies, and evolutionary games, with multi-agent RL algorithms to develop robust, patient-specific treatment protocols. This integration not only enhances therapy efficacy by dynamically adjusting doses but also delays resistance development, advancing fields like adaptive therapy and precision oncology. We formulate the mathematical foundations, incorporating state-action-reward models and equilibrium computations, and outline computational implementation using deep Q-networks and policy gradient methods. Theoretical advantages over existing RL or game-theoretic approaches are analyzed, with proof-of-concept simulations demonstrating practical feasibility. Overall, Nash-RL provides a scalable foundation for sustainable strategies that collaborate with, rather than combat, cancer's adaptive nature, paving the way for intelligent, personalized oncology and potentially transforming clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Long-horizon tasks, such as box stacking, pose a longstanding challenge in robotic manipulation, especially for Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL typically focuses on learning an optimal policy for completing an entire task, rather than determining the specific sequence of actions required to achieve complex goals. While RL finds a sequence of actions that maximizes the total reward of the task, the main challenge arises when there are infinite possibilities of chaining actions (e.g. reach, push) to achieve the same task (door-opening). In this case, RL struggles to find the optimal policy. In contrast, symbolic planning focuses on determining a sequence of actions to achieve the desired task. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates symbolic planning operators with hierarchical RL. We propose to change the way complex tasks are trained by learning independent policies for actions defined by high-level operators instead of learning a single policy for the complete long-horizon task. Our approach easily adapts to various tasks by adjusting the learned operator set on demand. We developed a dual-purpose high-level operator, which can be used both in holistic planning and as independent, reusable policies. Our approach offers a flexible solution for long-horizon tasks, e.g., stacking and inserting a cube, and door-opening. Experimental results indicate that our method achieves high success rates of around 95% in policy chaining for comprehensive plan execution and excels in learning independent policies. Furthermore, it remains robust and scalable even with a small sample set evaluation, attaining an 84% success rate for planning and executing a new task (door-opening) and 85% when dealing with a new operator. Experiments in dynamic environments further demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of our approach, which sustains a high success rate of around 90% and outperforms all baselines."

    "abstract": "Public communication links can serve as shelters to facilitate covert transmissions. To improve the covertness performance, we regard multiple multi-antenna public users as friends and leverage their abundant spatial degrees of freedom (SDoF) to resist illegal surveillance. However, the resulting complex directional interference introduces challenges in measuring the covertness and optimizing the beamformers. Accordingly, this study investigates a covert communication system where multiple public user pairs coexist with one covert user pair in multiple-input multiple-output interference channels. Specifically, a covert rate maximization problem through joint transceiver beamforming is formulated, which is difficult to solve as it is a non-convex problem. To address this, a centralized algorithm is first developed based on the successive convex approximation method that transforms the problem into a convex optimization framework. Additionally, to alleviate the backhaul overhead, we develop a decentralized solution utilizing primal decomposition to decouple the interference management and the covertness metrics at each transmitter, relying only on local channel state information. Simulations demonstrate that our proposed algorithms fully exploit the SDoF jointly provided by the spatial distribution of public users and the employment of multi-antenna technology. Therefore, our algorithms achieve superior performance over baselines that do not effectively leverage these spatial resources."

    "abstract": "Mobile video analytics systems are often deployed in diverse environments, where domain shifts place higher demands on the responsiveness of adaptation for ”expert models” running on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, due to the lack of effective automated on-device model retrieval strategies and corresponding mobile adaptation mechanisms, most existing frameworks still rely on cloud-centric adaptation architectures rather than mobile-centric ones, leading to delayed responses to such domain shifts. We introduce a hierarchical mobile-cloud collaborative adaptation framework, AutoMOCHA, for continuous mobile video analytics in dynamically evolving environments. It includes three main contributions: (1) It facilitates efficient history expert model retrieval, without relying on dataset-based model validation, through an automatically constructed model taxonomy and indexing mechanism that does not require prior domain knowledge; (2) It proactively coordinates onboard lightweight model reuse and finetuning strategy with remote model retrieval and retraining to achieve responsive model adaptation with low latency; (3) It accelerates onboard model reuse and finetuning through designing a dedicated mobile model cache management strategy and sparse updating policy. Extensive evaluations on real-world video data across three DNN tasks demonstrate that AutoMOCHA improves model accuracy during adaptation by up to 3.4%, increases the post-clustering silhouette coefficient by up to 33%, and reduces retraining frequency by up to 10%, all while maintaining optimal response latency and retraining time."

We have proposed an iterative algorithm to break the whole argument space into the minimum number of intervals, for any given desired accuracy. The LUT address generator of the proposed design does not require any comparators since the breakpoints generated by the proposed algorithm contain only a few non-zero bits. Similarly, the slopes of the line segments are represented by a few non-zero bits, such that the multiplication with slope is realized using hardwired shift operations or a few shift-add operations without using any LUT to store the slope values and without using any conventional multiplier. For the computation of the sigmoid function with fractional accuracy of 7 bits, the proposed design involves only 6 line segments, which requires 2 adders and an LUT to store 6 intercept words. When implemented on an Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA device, it is found to be 8 times faster than the fastest of the existing designs for the same accuracy and consumes less than half the resources used by the latter. Moreover, the proposed design for 9-bit fractional accuracy is approximately twice as fast and more resource-efficient than a recently reported design offering the same level of accuracy."

    "abstract": "In the realm of video processing technology and artificial intelligence (AI), ensuring the integrity and provenance of video content is paramount. Recent advances have shown that video containers hold valuable forensic traces. However, the highly structured and heterogeneous nature of video containers presents substantial challenges for directly learning effective features through AI-driven methods. As a result, existing approaches have largely depended on manually extracted features of video containers, such as frequency vectors of symbols, subsequently processed using machine learning techniques like Random Forests. Consequently, they struggle to comprehensively capture task-specific information and suffer from limitations in feature adaptability and generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel AI-driven container characterization approach for video integrity and source analysis, which eschews manual features entirely, enabling end-to-end training of the whole framework. Specifically, by modeling the video container as a semantic tree, we establish a lossless mapping relationship between the video container space and language space. This innovative container-to-language mapping significantly mitigates the heterogeneity challenges posed by video containers, enabling more effective analysis within a linguistic framework. Further-more, we develop a hierarchical language model that leverages this mapping to adaptively learn task-specific features from video containers without disrupting their structural and semantic information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method on video integrity verification and source identification tasks.

Among them, mask-based schemes have been widely applied due to their efficiency advantages. Unfortunately, as the invisibility of an individual local model, such schemes are vulnerable to poisoning attacks by Byzantine clients. Current work lacks a practical method to detect Byzantine clients within the mask-based scheme. We propose FBFL, a flexible Byzantine-robust federated learning scheme with privacy-preserving. While protecting the privacy of the client, we implement a defense against Byzantine clients without relying on an individual masked local model. Specifically, we design a secure distance computation method based on the Pedersen commitment. The exponential Manhattan distance we design is utilized to compute the malicious score of the client in order to distinguish the benign model from the abnormal model. Since the malicious score is obtained utilizing only the commitment value and not the masked local model, our Byzantine-robust method can be flexibly combined with other mask-based privacy-preserving methods. Security analysis shows that FBFL is Byzantine-robust and can ensure the data security of clients. Experimental evaluation shows that the robustness and efficiency of FBFL are great."

    "abstract": "Integrated pipeline-valve-vessel systems are essential in industrial processes but require periodic disassembly for inspection under extreme conditions. Robotic inspection offers an economical and efficient alternative to manual disassembly. However, existing robots are limited to inspecting pipelines or vessels separately. Continuous traversal through small-to-medium diameter pipelines (80–150 mm), valves, and into vessels remains challenging due to irregular and confined chambered structure. To overcome this limitation, we propose a chain-type magnetic wheeled robot featuring two key innovations: 1) the integration of a serial gear chain (SGC) with magnetic adhesion mechanism ensures the robot’s adaptability to irregular surfaces, reducing force-control dependency during complex valve navigation. Leveraging this characteristic, a distributed dual-end drive configuration within the SGC addresses power insufficiency caused by the robot’s suspension in the hollow regions and 2) the traditional force-angle stability margin is modified to serve as a criterion for tipover instability. Based on this, a predictive instability control framework is developed, integrating offline-computed posture thresholds with real-time attitude monitoring to enhance motion stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the robot achieves robust, stable traversal, and nondismantling inspection across pipelines, valves, and vessels without disassembly. This work provides valuable insights for industries, such as nuclear power and chemical engineering."

The goal is to maximize the system achievable rate while reducing energy consumption by controlling the aRIS beamforming switching frequency.

The unknown disturbances are modeled using linearly parameterized models, and distributed adaptive laws are designed to estimate these parameters, ensuring fixed-time convergence of these estimations. A novel fixed-time distributed control method for consensus in MAS is introduced, which differs from traditional methods that rely on fractional power state feedback or signum functions (where the convergence time depends on initial conditions and the control action is nonsmooth or discontinuous). Specifically, this method is based on regular state feedback to facilitate a uniformly smooth control process. This approach is validated through simulations, demonstrating that each agent’s state converges to the optimal solution within a fixed time."

The maximum Doppler that can be unambiguously measured for targets in HFSWR is restricted by the chirp repetition frequency. In this article, an approach for the extension of unambiguous Doppler in HFSWR is proposed based on Poisson disk sampling and sparse reconstruction. The start instants of adjacent chirps are set to be Poisson disk sampled. Taking advantage of the spectral antialiasing performance of the proposed nonuniform sampling strategy, the maximum unambiguous Doppler of HFSWR can be enlarged without decreasing the maximum aliasing-free range. The range-Doppler spectrum can be correctly reconstructed by utilizing a sparse reconstruction algorithm. Compared with the existing methods for resolving the Doppler ambiguity of HFSWR, the proposed method is able to monitor multitarget scenarios without introducing false alarms. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by simulations and experiments based on measured HFSWR data."

The existing systems typically use either inertial or vision-based methods, with well-known limitations. We propose a bimodal deep learning framework that combines inertial anomaly detection and video-based posture analysis with late fusion for improved performance. The system's evaluation on simulated nighttime falls reveals a 4.1% false positive rate in comparison to 8.9% for IMU-only and 6.9 to 10% for vision-only baselines, while maintaining high sensitivity. This result indicates a robust performance under low light and occlusions, and it supports continuous nocturnal monitoring in real-world settings."

    "abstract": "Existing studies have demonstrated that the introduction of nanomaterials into carbon-based actuators can significantly enhance their photothermal conversion efficiency. However, excessively high photothermal conversion efficiency makes actuators prone to thermal damage under intense laser irradiation. To address this issue, this study constructs a vision-based dynamic monitoring platform to achieve real-time identification of the actuator's operational status and early warning of damage under photoexcitation. Actuators with enhanced photothermal conversion efficiency are susceptible to structural burnout due to localized heat accumulation under high-power laser exposure, typically characterized by abnormal high-brightness patches in the imaging area. The developed vision monitoring system employs image processing algorithms and machine learning models to conduct real-time analysis of photofield distribution characteristics and structural deformation patterns, enabling dynamic evaluation of actuator performance and prospective identification of abnormal states. Experimental data show that this monitoring platform can reliably capture deviations in operational parameters and effectively reduce the risk of laser thermal damage through a closed-loop feedback mechanism. This research integrates efficient light-driven actuation mechanisms with intelligent monitoring technologies, providing high-performance and high-reliability solutions for advanced soft robotics, biomedical devices, and precision optical manipulation applications."

    "abstract": "Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to accurately match pairs of person images across different cameras. Existing Re-ID methods primarily focus on associations within single-type camera networks (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e.g.</i>, ground-ground or sky-sky matching), which are ineffective in addressing the significant viewpoint discrepancies in multi-type camera networks. One key reason for this is the absence of suitable large-scale datasets for algorithm evaluation, which limits the applicability of Re-ID across more diverse scenarios, despite its critical importance. To expand the scope of visual coverage and facilitate search operations in the special locations, we construct a novel benchmark: Multi-Source Sky-Land person Re-ID dataset (MSSL), including 66,928 images from 2,099 volunteers in nearly 20 unique scenes. Additionally, we observe that existing Re-ID systems struggle with drastic viewpoint variations in sky-ground Re-ID, especially on MSSL. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Source Prompts (MSP), separately learning finer cross-modal features of pedestrians from both sky and ground perspectives. These refined features better represent the true appearance of pedestrians from different viewpoints. Subsequently, we employ Multi-Source Alignment Loss to mitigate the impact of drastic viewpoint changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on our MSSL, as well as on other benchmarks such as AG-ReID dataset.

    "abstract": "Arbitrary microwave waveforms have become increasingly crucial for diverse applications, including high-capacity wireless communication, advanced radar systems, electronic countermeasures, and precision instrumentation. Generating arbitrary microwave waveforms with precise and flexible control over amplitude, phase, and frequency is critical to meet these applications’ stringent performance demands. In contrast to conventional electronic waveform generators, photonic generation methods overcome inherent limitations, offering substantial benefits like ultrabroad bandwidth, high-frequency operation, resistance to electromagnetic interference, and superior reconfigurability. This article reviews recent developments in photonic generation of arbitrary microwave waveforms, focusing on several prominent optical-domain techniques, including frequency-to-time mapping (FTTM), direct space-to-time mapping (DST), temporal pulse shaping (TPS), optical heterodyne technology, optical frequency combs (OFCs), optical injection, electro-optic modulation, and optoelectronic oscillation (OEO). We systematically analyzed the key characteristics, advantages, and application potential of these techniques, emphasizing recent research achievements and innovations. Moreover, photonic integration technology represents a pivotal step toward the practical arbitrary microwave waveforms generation. Integrated photonic microwave chips significantly reduce system size, weight, and power consumption, while enhancing stability and scalability. Such integrated systems are particularly promising for compact and portable arbitrary microwave waveforms generation in applications like on-chip radar, miniaturized communication modules, and flexible radio frequency (RF) testing platforms."

    "abstract": "Underwater images often suffer from color distortion and detail loss due to light absorption and scattering, which degrades visual quality and limits practical applications. To address these issues, a novel adaptive algorithm for underwater image color correction and detail enhancement is proposed. The algorithm first applies threshold stretching to adjust the grayscale range, enhancing contrast while mitigating the risk of localized overcompensation. Based on the color distribution, images are categorized into bluish and greenish tones, providing the foundation for the adaptive color compensation method (ACCM). The ACCM is designed to separately compensate different color channels, using the green channel as a reference to restore the most degraded channels while maintaining overall color balance. The compensation process is further constrained by the minimum color loss criterion to ensure consistent color fidelity. Furthermore, an edge detail enhancement method is formulated to recover fine details by amplifying intensity differences between the original image and its smoothed version. Extensive experiments on multiple underwater image data sets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving average improvements of 0.0021, 0.0646, 0.3677, and 0.0800 in underwater color image quality evaluation, underwater image quality metric, fog aware density evaluator, and colorfulness contrast fog density index metrics, respectively, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness across diverse underwater environments."

Contrary to the datasheets of GaN HEMTs manufacturers that highlight the reverse-conducting characteristics of the devices, this study finds that the performance of GaN HEMTs degrades significantly at MHz operations due to elevated reverse conduction losses, high-frequency oscillations, and thermal instability from self-heating. Toten-pole GaN inverters with and without antiparallel Schottky diodes are compared practically and with the help of an electro-thermal circuit model for operations at 1 MHz, 6.78 MHz and 13.56 MHz. Electro-thermal circuit modeling and experimental results demonstrate that GaN switches with antiparallel Schottky diodes can reduce dead-time switching power losses by 85% and improve overall converter efficiency by 2.7∼6.9% in prototypes of 24 W- 29 W. This approach also mitigates thermal runaway risks by lowering the junction temperature of GaN HEMTs, therefore increasing thermal stability. Furthermore, the junction capacitance of the diodes can dampen high-frequency dv/dt transients and reduce electromagnetic emission. The experimental results show reductions of 24.41 dBm in magnetic field emissions and 26.57 dBm in electric field emissions. These findings challenge the prevailing industry assumption that external antiparallel diodes are unnecessary for GaN HEMTs, providing a validated design framework for MHz-range applications."

The proposed antenna is designed on a Rogers RT/duroid 5880 substrate with overall dimensions of 23×23×0.5 mm3. This research employs advanced techniques, including Defective Ground Structures (DGS) and decoupling elements, to enhance isolation. The proposed design was analyzed using HFSS software and then confirmed through a measurement process that included its evaluation. According to the measured results, the results were well within the required frequency range. Specifically, the obtained average isolation was -34.43 dB, the return loss was below -10 dB, and the average radiation gain was 6.5 dBi at the target frequency. Additionally, the antenna demonstrated favorable performance in multipath environments, where the Envelope Correlation Coefficient (ECC) was consistently below 0.001. This result indicates excellent spatial diversity and minimal signal loss. The new features of the antenna that contribute to its performance, such as its small size and the use of parasitic elements and coupling reduction lines, make this antenna suitable for high-frequency density conditions. Additionally, the proposed antenna is well-suited for advanced applications, including high-speed, high-bandwidth, short-range Internet of Things (IoT) systems in the 24–39 GHz band, satellite communications, and 5G millimeter-wave networks (e.g., n260 band, 37–40 GHz), as well as other high-bandwidth telecommunication systems."

However, practical imperfections such as jittering and airflow of UAV could affect the phase shift of STAR-RIS, and consequently degrade network security. In this respect, this paper investigates the impact of phase shift errors on the secrecy performance of UAV-mounted STAR-RIS-assisted IoT systems. More specifically, we consider a UAV-mounted STAR-RIS-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system where IoT devices are grouped into two groups: one group on each side of the STAR-RIS. The nodes in each group are considered as potential Malicious nodes for the ones on the other side. By modeling phase estimation errors using a von Mises distribution, an analytical closed-form expressions for the ergodic secrecy rates under imperfect phase adjustment are derived. An optimization problem to maximize the weighted sum secrecy rate (WSSR) by optimizing the UAV placement is formulated and is then solved using a linear grid-based algorithm. Monte Carlo simulations are provided to validate the analytical derivations. The impact of phase estimation errors on system’s secrecy performance is analyzed, providing critical insights for the practical realisation of STAR-RIS deployments for secure UAV-enabled IoT networks."

    "abstract": "Fiber-optic interferometers are widely used in phase modulation (PM) time transfer systems. To achieve stable phase demodulation, resisting the phase drift within the interferometer is essential. Moreover, using lithium niobate phase modulator in the interferometer inevitably introduces residual intensity modulation (RIM) due to its inherent imperfections. A stable phase control method based on optical power detection is proposed to resist phase drift and concomitantly suppress RIM. Furthermore, the characteristics of phase control at the extremum point (EP) and near-extremum point (NEP) of the interferometric response curve are analyzed and compared. Analysis shows that EP control offers lower demodulation stability but higher sensitivity to intensity fluctuations than NEP control. A fiber-optic time transfer experiment validates the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method and confirms the analysis. The proposed method enhances the interferometer’s demodulation stability and shows good application prospects in phase signal detection."

    "abstract": "Timely ambulance allocation is essential for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) to deliver life-saving care effectively. Conventional methods often struggle to adapt to the unpredictable nature and locations of emergencies. Within EMS, efficient resource management is crucial for ensuring rapid and effective responses. While much emphasis has been placed on optimizing the deployment of ambulances from fixed stations, managing specialized critical care response units-known as Charlie vehicles in Qatar EMS-presents a distinct challenge. These rapid response cars are vital for providing advanced care in challenging situations, and their dynamic deployment requires a more flexible management strategy. Effectively relocating Charlie vehicles to areas with high anticipated demand after they have responded to an emergency introduces unique challenges that differ from traditional ambulance redeployment approaches. This paper proposes a novel dynamic redeployment system specifically for optimizing the allocation of critical care response vehicles, including those involved in patient transfers. Utilizing a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework, we create a deep scoring network that prioritizes and navigates various dynamic factors at each station. Experiments using real-world data from Qatar EMS demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms existing methods. For instance, our approach achieves faster average response times and improved critical response rates compared to the leading baseline method. Notably, we observe a substantial 21.55% reduction in average response time (AveRT) and an 18.34% increase in relative response time (RelaRT) in comparison to actual operational metrics. Our approach effectively shortens the time needed to reach patients, thereby increasing the likelihood of timely treatment and improving overall patient care outcomes."

    "abstract": "Surface finishing is a time-consuming, dangerous task, difficult to automate despite its necessity in many manufacturing processes. Its automation, particularly through robotics, increases productivity and relieves workers from health-critical tasks. However, challenges remain, as automated offline planning tools can result in certain areas being either neglected or overly processed. Ergodic control offers the possibility to cover target probability distributions in an online manner, by taking into account the observed coverage history. However, existing ergodic control approaches provide little flexibility in designing and adapting coverage strategies. Moreover, they come with simplifying assumptions, such as point-based dynamics, which are no longer valid for tasks where the robot is in contact with strongly varying curvatures on non-trivial surface geometries. In this work, we introduce a closed-form ergodic control framework that includes the tool imprint in the system modeling while simultaneously permitting the intuitive transfer of finish strategies, namely preferred motion directions. We build on the Spectral Multiscale Coverage (SMC) approach, augmenting it with a tool imprint model, as well as both target distributions and state-dependent movement directions extracted from human demonstrations. Through evaluations in a surface finishing task using a torque-controlled, 7-DoF, robot arm we show that our approach optimally covers surfaces according to the tool contact area, with robust error convergence."

For this purpose, we have opted to combine accurate two-dimensional (2D) analytical and numerical simulations with advanced DL approaches to investigate key design parameters impact on device performance. So, we have simulated the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of JLP devices under infrared illumination conditions and thoroughly analyze the influences of material property variations, channel doping levels, and device geometry on the phototransistor key performance metrics. And, diverse DL algorithms, including deep learning classification models, are used to evaluate and parameters significance. As well, feature importance analysis is performed to identify the key factors influencing the overall device responsivity (R). The results show that optimized doping and bias conditions yield a high responsivity with a reduced dark current. They reveal key design parameters that significantly impact phototransistor efficiency and provide valuable insights for optimizing device design. Furthermore, these findings highlight that the synergy between device physics and DL-based modeling provides a powerful methodology for the design of next-generation low-power, low-cost, and high-performance junctionless phototransistors (JLPs) for inter-chip data communication applications."

    "abstract": "On January 20, 2025, the second Trump Administration froze $20 billion in Inflation Reduction Act funding for climate adaptation and mitigation measures and for key clean energy infrastructure measures through Executive Order 14154, \"Unleashing American Energy.\" While the executive enjoys powers of discretion in how to enact Congress’s directives, unilaterally unwinding laws that have been passed through legislative and regulatory processes on policy bases is not one of them. Legislation endures precisely because it is enacted through statute. Executive orders and agency actions that unduly step outside of the authority designated to the executive branch and step into authority designated to the legislative branch puts any major legislation at risk of being effectively overturned by changing presidential administrations as their policy portfolios vary. At the same time that the Executive branch is overstepping into congressional authorities, the Supreme Court is expanding executive authority further by limiting the power of judicial review of Executive Orders – one of the few immediate checks available on executive action – in Trump v. Casa, Inc. This decision differs in effect from the Supreme Court’s decision in Loper Bright v. Raimondo, which narrowed executive administrative power by overturning Chevron Deference. This article will examine the bounds of the executive branch’s abilities to administer federal laws by executive order and by administrative rulemaking. It will explore, specifically, how the Appropriations Clause limits these powers and will dive deeper into constitutional arguments made in Climate United Fund v. Citibank, N.A., the court case brought by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund recipients whose funds were frozen by Executive Order 14154. Then, this article will examine the stakes and likely consequences associated with the Supreme Court’s ruling in Trump v. Casa, Inc. as well as expanding the scope of this ruling by considering its ramifications in the context of Loper Bright v. Raimondo. Ultimately, this article will conclude that if the United States is to have lasting and effective energy legislation, it must be immune to the changing views of the executive branch by being principally made through marquee legislation – not easily reversible executive orders and agency regulation – that is designed to withstand the changing policy priorities and goals of the presidency. More broadly, this article will advocate for a refocusing of the executive overreach issue as one that cuts across party lines, threatening the essential checks and balances of a functioning democracy. To have laws that last, we not only need stronger laws but stronger institutions, shored up by the separation of powers."

This study employs Faster R-CNN as the primary object detection algorithm and evaluates its performance against SSD and YOLOv5 under conditions representative of industrial inspection environments. Experimental results show that Faster R-CNN delivers the highest precision, recall, and mAP, confirming its superior detection accuracy. However, its slower inference speed limits its suitability for real-time applications. In contrast, YOLOv5 achieves the fastest processing time while maintaining competitive accuracy, making it well-suited for realtime monitoring tasks. SSD, while faster than Faster R-CNN, lags behind in detection performance, highlighting its limitations in high-precision use cases. The study also reveals that detection accuracy across all models is significantly affected by variations in lighting, underscoring the importance of robustness to environmental conditions. These findings offer practical guidance for selecting detection frameworks and inform future research on hybrid or adaptive approaches for reliable and efficient crack detection in dynamic industrial settings."

This transformation has caused significant growth in cloud data centers, which serve as the key infrastructure for cloud services, resulting in a substantial rise in energy consumption. Recent estimates indicate that global data center electricity usage could more than double between 2022 and 2026. This trend poses critical economic and environmental challenges, highlighting the urgent need for effective energy management strategies. This study proposes a deep learning model based on Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast the energy consumption of a data server. The model is developed using a dataset collected from a data server running on an HP Z440 workstation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model excels in performance, surpassing classical regression methods in terms of prediction accuracy and significantly improving energy forecasting in cloud environments. Our approach provides accurate energy consumption forecasts to support optimization efforts, reduce operational costs, and promote sustainability in cloud computing environments."

Leveraging the DAD-3DHeads dataset, which captures rich variations in pose, expression, occlusion, and lighting, our method involves systematic preprocessing, robust feature extraction, and explainable decision-making. A proxy engagement score is computed for each sample based on neutral facial expression, frontal head orientation, and absence of occlusion—serving as an interpretable surrogate ground truth. After normalization, multiple supervised classifiers are evaluated, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, and Multi-Layer Perceptron. The best-performing model, XGBoost, achieves 77 % accuracy and an F1-score of 0.82 on the test set. Feature importance analysis confirms the complementary roles of pose and AUs in engagement prediction. This interpretable and fully reproducible framework offers a practical alternative to black-box deep learning and may be extended to broader contexts requiring non-intrusive behavioral assessment."

Since PV systems operate under varying environmental and operational conditions, health monitoring must remain effective across all scenarios. TA-kNN improves robustness by comparing each data point only with data from similar conditions, referred to as the same \"type,\" thus avoiding misleading comparisons across dissimilar operating states. The proposed model can operates on standard voltage and current measurements, requiring no additional sensors. A confidence score, derived using a sigmoid-based function, is introduced to quantify the certainty of anomaly detection. The effectiveness of the TA-kNN model is validated using a 1 MW PV plant modeled in a Real-Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) and further evaluated on SCADA data from an operational solar facility. Results demonstrate high accuracy in detecting abnormal behavior, making the approach suitable for deployment in both small rooftop systems and large-scale PV installations."

    "abstract": "Cancer has become the second major health threat endangering human survival and represents a core challenge requiring urgent resolution in global public health. Immunotherapy is a novel therapeutic strategy that combats cancer by modulating the immune system. Although several immunotherapeutic agents have been clinically applied for cancer treatment, the presence of “cold” tumors in some patients leads to low response rates to immunotherapy. Potential off-target effects and other adverse events remain significant challenges in tumor immunotherapy. In this study, to address the limitations of immunotherapy for lymphoma, a highly heterogeneous and aggressive cold tumor, we designed chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5)-loaded macrophagebased microrobots to remodel the tumor microenvironment. This strategy synergistically integrates the inherent phagocytic functionality and tumor-tropic properties of macrophages with the biosafety advantages, tetherless operational capacity, and spatiotemporal precision of magnetically navigated platforms. CCL5 mediates immune cell chemotaxis and enhances tumor cell infiltration and metastatic potential. We conjugated cytokines to the surface of magnetic nanoparticles using the carbodiimide method, achieving excellent biocompatibility and magnetic responsiveness. The transwell assay confirmed the engineered macrophages' innate tumor tropism and magnetic field-guided targeting capability toward EL-4 cells. These magnetically responsive macrophages demonstrate potential for advancing safer and more effective clinical translation of immunotherapies. Our strategy facilitates immune cell reprogramming and recruitment, establishing a novel platform for tumor immunotherapy."

In this study, we investigate the impact of SAFs on a two-layer neural network trained on the MNIST image classification dataset and mapped onto a memristor crossbar array. We consider three fault types: hard stuck-at-0 (due to failed electroforming), stuckat-0 (due to a failed SET operation) and stuck-at-1 (due to a failed RESET operation). These faults are injected into the posttraining weight matrices mapped onto the crossbar arrays to simulate hardware-level defects more realistically. Experimental results show that inference accuracy drops below 50% at a 10% fault injection rate for stuck-at-0 faults, 9% for hard stuck-at-0 faults, and 5% for stuck-at-1 faults."

    "abstract": "False Data Injection (FDI) attacks pose significant threats by manipulating measurement data, leading to incorrect state estimation. Although numerous studies have focused on designing DC FDI attacks, few have addressed AC FDI attacks due to the complexity of incorporating non-linear AC power flows in the design process. Additionally, designing a sparse AC FDI attack presents another challenge because it involves solving a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem with nonconvex constraints, which is inherently difficult. This paper explores the design and implementation of a sparse AC FDI attack, where the attacker strategically selects a minimal set of measurements to manipulate while maintaining the nonlinearity and interdependence of AC power flow equations. The objective is to minimize the number of altered measurements, thereby reducing the attack’s detectability while achieving the desired state estimation error. The problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem. Binary variables indicate the selection of measurements to be manipulated, and continuous variables represent the measurement values. An optimization problem is designed to minimize the number of binary variables, translating into a sparse attack, while ensuring the attack remains efficient and hard to detect. The big-M method and conditional constraints are utilized to handle the fixed and variable measurement parameters effectively. Simulation results on the standard IEEE 57-bus test system demonstrate the efficacy of the sparse AC FDI attack in terms of its impact on state estimation and the minimal number of measurements required for successful implementation."

    "abstract": "Traditional static routing decision models struggle to adapt to dynamic network environments. This often leads to cascading issues such as information redundancy accumulation, critical services disruption, and so on. Moreover, they exhibit delayed responses and limited optimization effectiveness when coping with sudden traffic surges and changing network conditions, ultimately resulting in a systemic imbalance between resource utilization and quality of service (QoS) demands. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an adaptive path selection system based on deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, it integrates Deep Q-Networks (DQN) with the Actor-Critic algorithm to jointly optimize multiple network performance metrics, including link bandwidth, latency, and congestion. Furthermore, the system incorporates conditional mutual information as a dynamic weight adjustment mechanism, along with a partial-block attention mechanism and an experience replay buffer design, thereby enhancing the model’s capability in network state representation and training efficiency. Experiments are conducted in a simulation environment based on Mininet and the RYU controller. The proposed method demonstrates superiority in path selection and congestion control through comparative evaluations against ECMP, SPF, and baseline DQN algorithms. The results confirm that the proposed joint training architecture exhibits enhanced adaptability and robustness in dynamic network scenarios, offering an effective intelligent solution for traffic scheduling in 6 G networks."

To meet this need, this paper developed a data-driven decision-support tool that ranks projects based on their social benefits. The tool calculates economic cost savings from avoided power interruptions, synergistically combining the value of lost load (VOLL) and avoided unserved energy. This enables utilities to justify investments based on transparent benefit-cost metrics.

It integrates AI's capabilities in Image Analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide suitable and personalized recommendations to users. The system was developed using Python and leverages the OpenAI library to interface with Generative AI models, such as GPT-4o and DALL-E 3 [1]. The automated workflow comprises the following steps: Data Collection, Multi-Modal Analysis, Recommendation Generation, and Visual Display and Shopping Sourcing. In the data collection phase, the system receives user travel information, including country, city, dates, and planned activities. Furthermore, users can upload photographs of their own clothing for AI analysis. During the multi-modal analysis, the system processes weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and analyzes the uploaded clothing images to identify type, style, and color palette. Subsequently, in the recommendation generation phase, the AI creates outfit suggestions appropriate for both the weather and activities. It also assesses the suitability of the uploaded clothing and recommends necessary adjustments. Finally, the system can generate a 3D avatar image wearing the recommended outfit to help users visualize the look clearly [2], and it extracts keywords from the recommendations to generate shopping links for purchasing additional apparel [3]. The study's results, which were rigorously validated through statistical analysis, demonstrate that Generative AI holds significant potential to act as a personal assistant in travel planning, particularly in reducing the complexity of clothing preparation [4]. This enables users to make effective decisions and prepare for their journeys with confidence."

    "abstract": "The increasing integration of renewable energy generators into the conventional power grid has lowered the overall power system inertia. Low inertia may adversely impact the grid’s stability and resilience, leading to unintended grid failure and total system collapse upon severe contingencies. Current methods of emulating power grid inertia to enhance stability under low inertia conditions have some drawbacks. For example, the proportional-integral (PI) control method suffers from high overshoot and settling time, while the performance of the conventional model predictive controller (MPC) is highly dependent on the accuracy of the system model. Consequently, a new learning-based predictive virtual inertia control (VIC) is proposed. This strategy incorporates a physics-informed neural network (PINN) predictive model with an optimization-based safety filter to mitigate the impact of increasing integration of renewable energy generators through a virtual inertia emulation strategy. Our proposed strategy leverages advances in deep learning by implementing a PINN-based model to predict the system’s future behavior. The proposed method is compared to the MPC and PI controller. The results demonstrate the superior dynamic performance of the proposed method. Our implemented technique achieved the least frequency deviations upon contingencies in the IEEE 34 bus and the IEEE 39 bus studied systems with integrated inverter-based generators."

    "abstract": "Fast incorporation of variable renewables introduces unprecedented uncertainties into power grids. Grid operators lack tools for situational awareness of loss-of-load risks in grid operation. To bridge this gap, an operational resource adequacy (OpRA) technology is proposed for control room applications. OpRA quantifies forecast uncertainties from load, land-based wind, and offshore wind. Markov Chain Monte Carlo is used to generate operational scenarios based on these uncertainties and the availability of committed generation. A DC-OPF assesses the loss-of-load by minimizing the unserved load subjected to grid conditions. To manage computational complexity, OpRA is structured to support parallel computing, enabling scalable execution of bulk DC-OPF simulations. Reliability metrics, i.e., loss of load probability (LOLP), loss of load hours (LOLH), and expected unserved energy (EUE) are calculated to evaluate resource adequacy. The technology is validated on the New York Power Grid and evaluates how uncertainty reserve quantile selection affects grid reliability and efficiency."

This study evaluates the role of DLR in enhancing reserve deliverability and mitigating congestion rent. The cleared reserves from a day-ahead unit commitment (DAUC) are deployed in an optimal reserve deployment (ORD) model for each credible generator outage to assess deliverability. The procedure is applied to a subsection of the IEEE RTS 24-bus system, and results show that: a) DLR improves reserve deliverability by 10% to 55% by providing higher transmission capacity; b) DLR reduces congestion rent by 33% to 48% by decreasing the number of binding constraints and lowering the shadow prices of transmission constraints."

    "abstract": "Autonomous navigation in complex 3D underwater environments is crucial for biomimetic robotic fish. However, the traditional Artificial Potential Field (TAPF) suffers from limitations like susceptibility to local minima, target unreachability when obstacles are near the goal, and path oscillations unsuitable for biomimetic locomotion, hindering practical applications. To address these deficiencies, this paper proposes the Dynamic Logarithmic Artificial Potential Field with Adaptive Virtual Guidance (DL-APF-AVG) method, which integrates four key innovations: (1) a logarithmic attraction potential function ensuring target convergence even near obstacles; (2) a dynamic, state-aware repulsion potential considering relative velocity and angle for smoother, proactive avoidance; (3) an Adaptive Virtual Guidance (AVG) strategy to deterministically escape local minima traps; (4) a dynamic step adjustment mechanism to actively suppress path jitter. The synergy of these components enhances target reachability, generates smoother trajectories appropriate for biomimetic locomotion, and provides robust escape from various local minima traps. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method over TAPF are demonstrated through 3D simulations."

Characterized by covert intrusion processes and fast intrusion speeds, compromised systems are difficult to recover. Such attacks pose severe threats to cybersecurity and cause enormous economic losses. However, existing detection methods suffer from issues such as poor accuracy and timeliness, insufficient generalization capabilities, and vulnerability to evasion by attackers. To address these challenges, we propose a rapid detection framework leveraging semantic provenance graphs, which enhances both detection accuracy and timeliness. Our methodology involves: 1) unified parsing of multisource logs with semantic feature extraction to construct semantic provenance graphs; 2) graph embedding vector mapping and GNN-based structural feature management; and 3) a hybrid detection mechanism combining static features and dynamic behavioral analysis for early-stage attack identification. To verify the accuracy and efficiency of the method, we conducted comprehensive performance comparison experiments and effectiveness analysis experiments. Theoretical and experimental evaluations demonstrate our method achieves superior detection accuracy $(98.49 \\%)$, precision $(97.62 \\%)$, and recall $(99.03 \\%)$ compared to baseline approaches, while maintaining an average detection latency of $\\mathbf{1 . 2 5}$ seconds."

Despite the outstanding progress of modern accelerators, their performance potential is limited by their ISA. Recently, research around composable instruction sets (CIS) has emerged with the aim of improving the efficiency of modern accelerator ISAs. However, while CIS significantly outperforms existing ISAs with near-optimal PE utilization, no existing instruction scheduling approach supports the temporal composability requirements to correctly schedule CIS programs. The goal of this work is to propose a scalable scheduling algorithm that can meet CIS requirements. We propose a novel timing model structure built upon five fundamental concepts - operations, events, transformations, anchors, and constraints - that accurately capture CIS timing behavior and constraints. Using this model, we automatically formulate scheduling problems that can be solved using constraint programming (CP) solvers. In addition, we propose a methodology to synchronize scheduled instructions and generate functional CIS assembly code. Finally, we design experiments to study the scalability and quality of our scheduling approach. Across multiple dimensions of complexity, our approach scales linearly and produces near-optimal scheduling solutions."

The CMM collects real-time environmental and soil data from 62 distributed monitoring stations and fuses them with regional rainfall data from Thailand’s National Hydroinformatics Data Center. This integrated dataset is used to train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) that determines the optimal irrigation quantity (Iopt) for each monitoring cell. The system aims to maximize Adaptive Water Use Efficiency (WUE) while providing accurate pre-harvest predictions of yield (tons/rai) and Commercial Cane Sugar (CCS) values. Field trials demonstrated that the proposed CMM–AIS framework improved yield by 15–25% and achieved more consistent CCS compared with traditional irrigation practices.

    "abstract": "As extreme weather events become more common and threaten power grids, the continuing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) introduces a growing opportunity for their use as a distributed energy storage resource. This energy storage can be used as backup generation with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, where electricity is sent back from EV batteries to the grid [1]. With enough participation from EV owners, V2G can mitigate outages during grid emergencies. In order to investigate a practical application of V2G, this study leverages a vast array of real-world data, such as survey results on V2G participation willingness, historical outage data within ERCOT, current EV registrations, and demographic data. This data informs realistic emergency grid scenarios with V2G support using a synthetic transmission grid for Travis County. The results find that as EV ownership rises in the coming years, the simultaneous facilitation of bidirectional charging availability would allow for V2G to play a substantial role in preventing involuntary load shed as a result of emergencies like winter storms."

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have become an essential approach for enabling autonomous evolution in artificial intelligence (AI) models. As the representative form, autonomous vehicles equipped with new energy powertrains are expected to take into account the external dynamic environment, human-centered driving demand, and the internal power supply. This paper aims to integrate fundamental tasks of energy-saving and autonomous driving, realizing end-to-end self-learning-based improvements. Firstly, a Python-Simulink-Unreal Engine/Carla-based co-simulation framework is proposed after customizing 3D driving scenarios and enhancing vehicle modeling. Then, focusing on the vehicle-level embodied intelligence, a DRL-based energy-saving full-body control system is proposed, in which DRL agents are trained to collaboratively learn adaptive cruise control (ACC) and lane-keeping assist (LKA) at the vehicle driving layer, as well as energy management strategy (EMS) and transmission shift strategy (TSS) at the powertrain level. Moreover, to achieve the integration of energy-saving driving and end-to-end autonomous driving, Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception is incorporated into the state space. This not only constructs a dual-modal state space but also facilitates extensions to other end-to-end tasks. Finally, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform is established. The results show that the DRL-based energy-saving control system maintains a speed of 60 km/h while staying within the lane 3.82 m wide on a 7.041 km circular road. The complete drive lasts 557 seconds and achieves a fuel economy of 7.748 L/100 km."

    "abstract": "Micro-positioning and pick-and-place applications at the millimeter scale are driving the development of smaller robots necessitating the use of alternative methods for design and manufacture. Additive manufacturing can enable significant cost and time savings in the fabrication of robots while having a low barrier to entry. Specifically, multimaterial 3D printing naturally lends itself to the creation of monolithic mechanisms by removing the requirement for manual assembly, in particular, when compliant joints can replace the rigid joints that are traditionally used. The lack of an assembly requirement naturally opens up the possibility of reducing the size scale of these mechanisms. In this work, the design, fabrication, and characterization of an additively manufactured mesoscale compliant parallel robot actuated by piezoelectric bimorphs through a compliant transmission mechanism is presented. The transmission mechanism is required to convert and amplify the small but rapid linear displacements of piezoelectric actuators into the large rotational motion that is required to create a large workspace for the compliant parallel robot. The developed planar parallel robot has a workspace with maximum planar extents of 14.36 mm by 8.66 mm, with a total area of 65.6 mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>.

Featuring a reconfigurable resonant network, the proposed rectifier dynamically adjusts its voltage gain across multiple levels, enabling the system to maintain a nearly constant output voltage under varying load and coil misalignment conditions. Comprehensive circuit analysis is conducted to derive explicit expressions for both the voltage gain and input reactance of the LI class-E rectifier. Based on this analysis, a systematic design methodology is presented to realize dynamic gain adjustment while preserving zero-voltage switching (ZVS) and constant input reactance. A 6.78 MHz WPT prototype was constructed and evaluated. The rectifier effectively adapted its gain in response to coupling variations, eliminating the need for external regulators. Moreover, the rectifier not only achieved ZVS operation itself but also maintained ZVS in the transmitter by providing constant input reactance. As a result, switching losses were significantly reduced, and the system achieved a high overall efficiency of 88.0%."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a direct speed estimator based on the sliding mode principle (SM-DSE). Unlike conventional methods that rely on intermediary signals such as back electromotive force and high-frequency response current to obtain speed and position information, the SM-DSE achieves full speed range noise-free sensorless control without any intermediary signals. It is also applicable to both surface-mounted and interior permanent magnet synchronous motor. Firstly, the design process of the SM-DSE is introduced, along with explanations of how position is obtained through speed integration and how the initial position is determined. Secondly, by defining the tracking rate (TR) of the estimated speed, the paper analyzes the errors caused by speed integration and low-pass filter. The action states of the joint module are simulated to explore the relationship between the error, TR, and number of actions. Thirdly, to address these issues, this paper proposes a zero-crossing correction method based on the virtual-Z-pulse of the photoelectric encoder. By compensating the final position in each cycle based on the zero-crossing point, the accumulated integration error can be effectively eliminated. This enables the method to achieve high-precision, noise-free control over the full speed range, making it suitable for high precision control scenarios in robotic joint modules. Finally, experiments are conducted on both SPMSM and IPMSM to verify the effectiveness of the proposed sensorless control strategy."

    "abstract": "The rapid increase in wireless devices has raised significant security and privacy concerns, positioning Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) as a crucial physical-layer security technology. Although Deep Learning (DL) methods have been widely applied to SEI due to their powerful end-to-end nonlinear mapping capabilities, they generally require large amounts of high-quality signal examples, which are difficult to obtain in adversarial environments. Moreover, wireless channel perturbations induce a distribution shift between the training and testing signal examples from the same emitter. This shift prevents DL-enabled SEI models from learning emitter-specific, channel-agnostic features, leading to a severe degradation in identification performance. In this work, we propose a cross-channel SEI method based on Meta-Feature Augmentation-Enhanced Few-Shot Learning (MFA-FSL) to efficiently address the aforementioned challenges. To overcome the data scarcity, we use signal examples from base emitters with physical-layer characteristics similar to target emitters for pre-training. To overcome the channel perturbations, we employ meta-learning as the pre-training technique to learn a channel-agnostic feature embedding function. Considering that the function does not perform well in scenarios where signal examples of target emitters are extremely scarce, we approximate the target emitter’s feature distribution and sample augmented features from it. These augmented features, together with the raw features extracted from a few signal examples of target emitters, provide sufficient supervision to train a simple classifier. Experiments conducted on a Wi-Fi dataset comprising 16 emitter categories—10 as base emitters and 6 as target emitters—demonstrate that our proposed method achieves more than 85.63% identification accuracy with only 5 signal examples per target emitter, maintaining more than 83.35% accuracy even under varying wireless channel conditions.

    "abstract": "This article presents a highly integrated, high-power outphasing transmitter with self-packaging technique in the D band. The transmitter achieves system-level optimization through the co-design of complementary metal–oxide –semiconductor (CMOS) active circuits, on-chip antennas, and off-chip packaged. By leveraging ultra-low-profile source-integrated metasurface technology, the design transforms an air-fed lens antenna into a cost-effective multilayer printed circuit board (PCB), effectively reducing the packaging height from one focal length to one-fifth, corresponding to an 80% reduction. This structural optimization significantly enhances the equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP) while maintaining power consumption, thereby realizing self-packaged. Furthermore, the concept of in-antenna power combining is extended to an outphasing power-combining network, facilitating the realization of a fully integrated D-band outphasing transmitter chip. This design ensures high fidelity and high output power even when transmitting advanced modulation signals. Measurement results indicate that this self-packaged outphasing transmitter achieves an EIRP of 39 dBm at 145 GHz with a power consumption of 924 mW, and a 3-dB EIRP bandwidth from 130 to 156 GHz, covering 18.2% of the frequency range. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this D-band CMOS self-packaged outphasing transmitter achieves the highest EIRP."

Measurements and simulations indicate that the antenna achieves a VSWR below 2.2 across 2–44 GHz, with a peak gain of 18.5 dBi at 36 GHz. The optimized antenna measures 48 mm × 50 mm × 100 mm.

    "abstract": "Optical remote sensing images (ORSI) feature unique scenes and complex imaging conditions. Specifically, they exhibit substantial variations in object scale, quantity, structure, and distribution. Consequently, salient object detection in ORSI (ORSI-SOD) is pivotal in ORSI content perception and understanding. Additionally, the limitations of the single modality impede the advancement of ORSI-SOD. To tackle these issues, we propose a Depth-guided and Iterative Refinement Network (DINet) for ORSI-SOD. By incorporating depth information as auxiliary cues, we introduce a multi-modal strategy for ORSI-SOD, resulting in improved accuracy in the localization and segmentation of salient objects. To address the variability of salient objects, we design an Aggregation Perception Enhancement (APE) Module. This module integrates complementary cues from cross-modal features using multi-dimensional attention mechanisms. By fostering cross-modal interactions, the APE module effectively preserves both detail and spatial location information. Furthermore, we propose an Iterative Guidance Refinement Decoder to handle boundary uncertainty. The decoder uses initial predictions to guide the decoding phase and iteratively refine results. Simultaneously, it minimizes noise from depth cues, yielding predictions with more accurate boundaries. Experimental comparisons with 22 state-of-the-art methods show that DINet exhibits superior performance while maintaining lightweight (11.98M) and real-time (55FPS) capabilities."

    "abstract": "Video platforms have increasingly been observed forming partnerships with other service providers (e.g., digital music service provider) through the launch of membership bundles. This paper analytically investigates such strategic choices of competing video platforms regarding two paid membership strategies, i.e., standard plans and membership bundles. In the basic model, the chosen service provider is assumed to exhibit similar horizontal attributes as the video platform. Therefore, compared to standard plans, membership bundles reinforce the intensity of mismatches, even though they bring incremental benefits. Our study unveils the following intriguing findings. First, when the incremental value consumers receive from membership bundles is sufficiently small (large), both platforms prefer to adopt standard plans (membership bundles). Second, in the scenario where the incremental value is moderate, both platforms can be better off by adopting asymmetric membership strategies if network effects are strong. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the provision of membership bundles will intensify platform competition. This result implies that the provision of membership bundles may hurt platforms' profitability when network effects are very weak and the incremental value is not very large. However, given that membership bundles can increase social welfare, policymakers may encourage their applications. In the model extensions, the robustness of our results is tested. We allow for alternative preference correlations across bundled services, endogenize the revenue-sharing rate via the incremental value created by bundling, and introduce asymmetric intensities of network effects for different plans."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a hierarchical fuzzy learning (HFL) framework that restructures fuzzy control synthesis around Virtual Tracking Targets (VTTs). First, we introduce a VTT-driven hierarchical architecture in which each non-output state is guided by an autonomous virtual agent that simultaneously (i) directs state evolution toward task-consistent trajectories and (ii) self-organizes its auxiliary control role via satisfaction of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) conditions. This dual functionality departs from static virtual controls in fuzzy backstepping and endows the hierarchy with intrinsic adaptivity. Second, we establish a parallel computational paradigm for controller synthesis: instead of the canonical cascaded design that enforces strict layer-by-layer dependency, all VTTs are optimized concurrently. This parallelization not only removes the sequential bottleneck of adaptive/optimal backstepping but also yields scalability benefits for high-dimensional systems without sacrificing stability guarantees. Third, to handle unknown VTT derivatives that commonly hinder inverse/fuzzy designs, we embed a first-order low-pass filter to deliver real-time derivative surrogates, thereby avoiding explicit differentiation. A unified Lyapunov analysis proves uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) of both the filtered tracking errors and the fuzzy weight estimation errors, providing a twofold convergence guarantee in fuzzy control. Comprehensive analyses characterize stability, and approximation properties; demonstrating improved tracking accuracy, reduced control energy due to parallel synthesis, and enhanced resilience under derivative uncertainty."

This study employs simulations to compare two fault-tolerance strategies for Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB) multilevel converters with both star and delta connections. In the star configuration, an algorithm readjusts modulation indices and carrier phases after cell failures to maintain balanced line voltages. The delivered power is preserved, but harmonic distortion rises. In the delta connection, recovery is simpler: increasing the modulation index of the healthy cells is sufficient. The resulting distortion is lower, though it demands a DC bus 73% higher and an additional output filter. Results show that both strategies continue to supply the nominal voltage after a fault. The choice hinges on the trade-off between control and hardware: the star configuration offers greater robustness with existing equipment, whereas the delta configuration improves waveform quality at the cost of more demanding power electronics. The study provides clear guidelines for selecting the most suitable CHB topology when service continuity and power quality are of critical importance."

Existing air quality monitoring systems often rely on single sensor nodes covering wide areas, resulting in insufficient data that hinders accurate pollutant-dispersion analysis and informed urban planning. This study developed a cost-effective, multi-nodal, air quality and traffic monitoring system with its digital twin. It consists of four deployable air quality sensor nodes and one camera-based traffic monitoring node, linked to a gateway node that transmits data to a local and cloud database. An integrated platform is used to present and visualize the obtained data. A pollutant dispersion simulation was also implemented as part of a digital twin framework to dynamically represent the temporal changes in pollutant movement within the monitored area. On-site deployment of the system demonstrated consistent wireless communication performance, with an average of 97% network packet success rate between sensor nodes, and an average power consumption of 880 mW per sensor node given the array of sensors used, enabling continuous battery-powered operation. Elevated pollutant concentrations were observed in instances of heavy traffic flow near a sensor node or when vehicles nearby were idling or accelerating. Digital Twin Model evaluation showed that ENVI-met with the SUMO-based emissions profile yields the most similar CO2 estimates when compared to the sensor readings. It also verified that pollutant movement in the area is not only affected by vehicles but also by urban morphology, wind characteristics, and environmental factors."

It performs simple bitwise operations on these hypervectors, enabling efficient classification in tasks such as biosignal applications. A major challenge in HDC is the encoding of analog signals into hypervectors. In seizure detection, features from the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal are typically extracted prior to encoding. Common features include local binary patterns (LBP), spectral power, line length, and mean amplitude. While these features have been individually evaluated in terms of classification accuracy, their comparative hardware performances remains largely unexamined. This work presents a comparative analysis of various encoding schemes for seizure detection, evaluating their classification accuracy, area, and energy efficiency. Among the approaches considered, single, distinctive features such as LBP are determined to be the most efficient choice for seizure detection, achieving 86.1% sensitivity and 71.7% specificity. In contrast, continuous-valued features like spectral power and line length offer less accuracy, while combining multiple features with LBP increases specificity by 6.7% but at the cost of 195% increase in area and a 309% increase in energy."

Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signal was processed for Skin Conductance Level (SCL), Skin Conductance Response (SCR), and spectral energy of two bands. Results showed increased theta activity during sleep deprivation, particularly in posterior EEG channels (Pz, PO7, PO8, Oz). Cognitive ratios decrease in anterior EEG channels (Fz, C3, Cz, C4) and increases in posterior EEG channels for sleepless state.

    "abstract": "Network Interface Cards (NICs) greatly evolved from simple basic devices moving traffic in and out of the network to complex heterogeneous systems offloading host CPUs from performing complex tasks on in-transit packets. These latter comprise different types of devices, ranging from NICs accelerating fixed specific functions (e.g., on-the-fly data compression/decompression, checksum computation, data encryption, etc.) to complex Systems-on-Chip (SoC) equipped with both general purpose processors and specialized engines (Smart-NICs). Similarly, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) moved from pure reprogrammable devices to modern heterogeneous systems comprising general-purpose processors, real-time cores and even AI-oriented engines. Furthermore, the availability of high-speed network interfaces (e.g., SFPs) makes modern FPGAs a good choice for implementing Smart-NICs. In this work, we extended the functionalities offered by an open-source NIC implementation (Corundum) by enabling time-aware traffic management in hardware, and using this feature to control the bandwidth associated with different traffic classes. By exposing dedicated control registers on the AXI bus, the driver of the NIC can easily configure the transmission bandwidth of different prioritized queues. Basically, each control register is associated with a specific transmission queue (Corundum can expose up to thousands of transmission and receiving queues), and sets up the fraction of time in a transmission window which the queue is supposed to get access the output port and transmit the packets. Queues are then prioritized and associated to different traffic classes through the Linux QDISC mechanism. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the approach allows to properly manage the bandwidth reserved to the different transmission flows."

As projects grow in complexity, maintaining and extending verification code becomes increasingly difficult, particularly in collaborative environments. This calls for a methodology that defines a clear structure and promotes reuse through modular, composable testbench components. In this paper, we present a Scala-based verification framework that adopts a structured approach to building modular and reusable testbenches, inspired by the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM). We analyze the core mechanisms through which UVM achieves modularity and reusability, and identify a minimal subset that provides equivalent functionality with reduced complexity. The result is a lightweight verification framework in Scala 3 using Verilator as a backend, which allows for simple unit-test-style testing as well as complex UVM-style testbench environments."

    "abstract": "Currently, when analyzing the primary frequency response for inertial energy response, such as the rotational inertia of all active machines in the system, as well as the effect of governor response on the performance of primary reserves, it is difficult to ensure delivery due to network congestion. This work establishes conditions for optimal allocation and deployment by the primary response through an Optimal Power Flow model based on the primary frequency response, which is linked to system inertia and the rates of change of system governors and deadbands. Additionally, transmission losses are included and modeled as a piecewise-linear approximation of the active power flows. The proposed formulations are validated and compared using the 24-bus test system. The results demonstrate that it is crucial to account for post-contingency transmission constraints to ensure reserve delivery and to optimize generator output under contingency conditions, including simultaneous N-2 generation contingencies."

The proposed solution leverages a wireless sensor network of multiple ESP8266-based nodes, equipped with temperature, humidity, and gas sensors, to continuously monitor environmental conditions. Data is efficiently aggregated using the ESP-NOW protocol and transmitted to a scalable Node.js backend. The core intelligence of the system is driven by a dual machine-learning architecture: a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model performs real-time fire detection by analyzing live sensor data, while a Random Forest model predicts future temperature and humidity trends to anticipate fire risks. These insights are delivered to end-users through a mobile application, which provides real-time alerts, system status updates, and risk assessments for firefighters and forest managers. Designed with an emphasis on robustness and scalability, the system incorporates secure, role-based access control and fault-tolerant communication protocols. Experimental results confirm the system's efficacy in delivering reliable, low-latency warnings, demonstrating its potential to significantly mitigate the ecological and economic impact of wildfires."

Many such prosumers are interested in increasing revenue, which can be accomplished using a hybrid battery-solar system since more energy is available to export during peak demand hours. This paper aims to maximize revenue considering charging time and coulombic efficiency. A two-stage approach is proposed: the first stage optimizes battery charging power for the state of charge per cell, utilizing a Taylor Series approximation for steady-state efficiency; the second stage optimizes battery sizing. When tested for different solar profiles using field solar and battery data and time-of-use rates, the proposed technique generates more revenue than non-optimized strategies, improves battery pack life, and uses a simple Taylor Series based algorithm."

    "abstract": "This paper offers a configurable architecture design utilizing Parallel ultra-low-power RISC-V cores tailor-made for IoT applications. The architecture integrates three cores (MicroRV32IMEC, Zero-RV32IMEC, and Riscy). It is managed by a controller that selects the correct core primarily based on the least significant bits of the input instruction opcode. In the 32-bit RISC-V instruction set architecture, these two bits (LSBs) permit 4 variations (00, 01, 10, 11), with only 11 being applied across all 32-bit RISC-V ISAs to be had within the available and their supported extensions except for the compressed extension and these bits guiding core activation: the Micro-Riscy core is enabled for opcode 00, the Zero-Riscy core for opcode 01, and the Riscy core for opcode 10. This selection mechanism optimizes power consumption and overall performance by specific system requirements, particularly after enhancements to the Zero-Riscy core (Zero-RV32IMEC). Specifically, after designing and integrating the approximate adder into this core, our proposed architecture conserves 48.27% less power than the original three cores, while it achieves 27.25% a better execution time. Therefore, it is suitable for wearable biomedical devices and energy-sensitive IoT applications. The proposed architecture strikes a balance between efficiency and flexibility, addressing the critical needs of low-power applications while providing the flexibility of RISC-V instruction sets."

Pumped hydro energy storage, which accounts for the vast majority of global grid-scale storage, remains one of the most cost-effective and long-duration storage technologies available. Hence, this study presents a novel tool designed to assess the untapped potential of inland lakes and reservoirs for micro-PSH, using Michigan’s relatively flat landscape as a case study due to its extensive but underutilized water infrastructure. To ensure accuracy and reliability, the tool incorporates extensive data gathered from authorized sources, covering more than 420 water facilities and potential reservoirs in the state. The tool evaluates key parameters such as horizontal and vertical distances, volume, and the total storage capacity of each reservoir. Its robust assessment framework integrates these metrics to evaluate each site’s potential. The tool’s intuitive interface and geospatial visualizations support actionable insights for planners and scalable deployment of distributed storage infrastructure."

    "abstract": "Context: The advent of large language models (LLMs) have changed the way artificial intelligence interacts with users by understanding and generating natural language. In the field of user experience (UX) design, they open up new ways to improve design processes, support user-centered approaches, and create more inclusive and personalized digital experiences. However, there is still limited research that looks closely at how LLMs are used in UX design. Objective: The primary role of this study is to explore how academic research is addressing the integration of large language models to UX Design. It focuses on identifying current themes, how researchers are working together, and how the focus of the studies has changed over time. Method: This bibliometrics study is based on 42 research papers published between 2022 and 2025, selected from the databases: SpringerLink, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, Web of Science, Arxiv, and Dimensions by using the PRISMA method. Tools like Bibliometrix and RStudio were used to analyze publication trends, citation patterns, and the main topics covered in the literature. Results: The findings show that research on LLMs and UX has grown quickly in recent years, especially after the release of tools like ChatGPT. Most of the publications originate from researchers in the USA, China, and Canada. The most common topics include chatbots, co-creation with AI, personalization, and accessibility issues such as fairness and transparency. A few papers were cited often, but many received limited attention, showing that the field is still developing. Conclusion: This analysis synthesizes early research trends in LLM-driven UX design, revealing growing academic interest. Findings highlight the need for deeper investigation into how these models enable inclusive and user-centered solutions, while underscoring the value of cross-disciplinary collaboration between AI and UX fields to advance design innovation."

These operations are commonly used in hyperspectral image (HSI) registration processes to compensate for motion in the observed scene. The primary objective of this research is to minimize the computational resource usage of the algorithm while optimizing overall efficiency. To achieve this, a reconfigurable hardware architecture based on FPGA is employed, where the rotation algorithm is implemented as an accelerator using the Vitis HLS synthesis tool and the block flow mechanism. The FPGA-based solution with four cores achieved a latency of 0,445 ms and a throughput of 1396,9 MB/s, with an energy consumption of only 1,09 mJ. Additionally, an alternative implementation was carried out on a GPU-based architecture (Jetson Nano), resulting in a higher latency of 12,55 ms and an energy consumption of 62,75 mJ. The evaluation included energy consumption, comparison with other solutions reported in the literature, and quality metrics. The results demonstrate that the FPGA-based solution is more efficient in terms of resource utilization and energy consumption, with minimal error."

Additionally, a short analysis of the sparse autoencoder’s hidden layer for five pulse attack samples provides evidence that the model learns subtle neuron activation patterns to differentiate between samples but represents similar samples consistently with same neuron activations."

Results reveal that LSTM occasionally achieves the lowest error values at seed =8 (MAE =0.155, RMSE =0.291 ) and lowest training losses were found with very high seed (4,8) at value (0.00144236 and 0.0014224) respectively. The BiLSTM model slightly higher but consistent loss across seeds because its ability to learn bidirectional temporal dependencies without significant overfitting. The hybrid CNN-BiLSTM achieves stable, competitive results, outperforming BiLSTM and closely matching CNN, with seed =8 (MAE =0.286, RMSE =0.362 ) showing balanced and reliable accuracy. The proposed hybrid framework not only enhance forecasting precision but also provide a scalable solution for broader time-series applications, contributing to smarter energy management, improved demand and supply balancing, and reliable grid operations."

    "abstract": "Threat intelligence, through the transmission, exchange, and reuse of critical cybersecurity content, facilitates the formation of collaborative defense trust alliances among enterprises and organizations. This enables collective identification, blocking, and tracking of intruders, making it a critical foundation for cybersecurity governance. However, as the intelligence ecosystem continues to evolve, key challenges persist in the areas of intelligence management, security, benefits, and sharing. The uneven quality of threat intelligence has resulted in users struggling to navigate a landscape of unpredictable “blind-box” information. By integrating the “next-generation application architecture” of Web 3.0 and the “next-generation data management” approach of data fabric, this paradigm introduces novel characteristics such as decentralization, strong trust, tamper-resistance, high consistency, and mutual recognition into threat intelligence sharing. This approach holds the potential to overcome current technical and management bottlenecks, enabling seamless integration and functional autonomy among defense entities. It fosters a deep “supply-demand synergy” for threat intelligence, achieving a new level of comprehensive fusion and collaborative security."

However, the communication of UAVs based on narrowband communication is faced with severe interference problems. To effectively address such interference, this study proposes an improved fruit fly optimization algorithm. Specifically, by constructing a dynamic interference model, a multi-objective optimization strategy is employed to improve the olfactory search and visual search stages of the traditional fruit fly optimization algorithm, which significantly enhances the global search ability and convergence speed of the algorithm. Meanwhile, a communication interference model is established, and the frequency selection problem is ingeniously transformed into an optimization problem. The simulation results show that, under the interference environment, the improved algorithm can effectively enhance the anti-jamming performance of UAV narrowband communication, further improving the communication quality and reliability."

The sampling capacitor itself is leveraged to set the dominant pole, enabling a power-efficient pole placement strategy in a two-stage buffer configuration.

    "abstract": "Phase distortion caused by nonlinearity remains a critical challenge in high-accuracy fringe projection profilometry (FPP). Existing nonlinearity correction methods suffer from significant limitations. System calibration-based approaches are prone to failure under environmental disturbances, while recent data-driven compensation methods exhibit drawbacks such as heavy reliance on pre-training and poor interpretability. To address this current situation, this study proposes a physics principle-driven framework based on Feature Phase-Invariant Points (FPIPs). We reveal for the first time the existence of FPIPs in multi-step phase-shifting systems; these points maintain a constant phase value under arbitrary nonlinear distortions (ϕ<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><sub>FPIPs</sub></i>≡ϕ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>). Based on this core discovery, this work utilizes the intensity distributions of two sets of fringe patterns with different frequencies at the FPIPs to construct dual-frequency constraint equations, achieving the direct solution of the Gamma value. Combined with a statistical fusion strategy to obtain the global Gamma value, it effectively suppresses noise interference. Finally, a Gauss-Newton iterative algorithm is adopted to optimize phase compensation, realizing the correction of nonlinear measurement errors. Both numerical simulations and experimental results demonstrate that this algorithm significantly reduces the phase errors brought by nonlinearity, verifying the algorithm’s effectiveness and robustness. It is worth noting that the proposed framework employs a point-wise computation mode, ensuring precise recovery of measurement details. This physics-driven approach provides an innovative solution for nonlinearity correction in FPP that is calibration-free and eliminates reliance on data-driven methods, significantly enhancing measurement robustness and practicality."

    "abstract": "Neutral beam injection (NBI) is a key auxiliary heating technology used in magnetic confinement fusion devices. With the scale up of the device, the requirement of beam energy is higher. A negative ion source-based neutral beam injection (NNBI) system is an inevitable choice, but the NNBI system presents significant engineering complexity and technical challenges. To investigate and master core NNBI technologies, an NNBI test facility is currently being developed under the Comprehensive Research Facility for Fusion Technology (CRAFT) in China. The initial operational targets for the CRAFT NNBI system are to achieve a beam with energies in the range of 200400 keV, the neutral beam power of 2 MW, and the pulse duration of 100 s. In the negative ion source, the beam divergence is one of the important parameters that determines the pulse duration and energy of the beam. A large beam divergence will cause heavy thermal load on the electrode grids and additional heat load on the beamline components. These can cause the breakdown of grids and interrupt the acceleration process. The accelerator beam optics design for the CRAFT NNBI dual-driver negative ion source is based on IBSimu. Two diagnostic methods, beam emission spectroscopy (BES) and secondary electron emission (SEE), are adopted to analyze the optical characteristics of beam in the experiments. The experimental results verify the simulation results calculated by IBSimu, confirming the limitations and reliability of the simulation program."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image (HSI) captures hundreds of narrow bands, offering abundant spatial and spectral information across various application domains. In recent years, deep learning techniques have shown strong potential in HSI processing, with a range of models being explored. However, the fixed geometric structure of convolutional kernels in CNN model impedes interactions between long-term dependencies, and existing transformer methods have not fully harnessed the spectral structural characteristics of HSI data. To address these issues, we proposed a multiscale samples transformer (MSST) that effectively extracts spatial and spectral features via two separate branches respectively. In spectral branch, the spectral sequence of the individual target pixel is used as input sample, a spectral transformer (SpecFormer) is proposed to comprehensively extract the spectral structural features. In spatial branch, three-dimensional tensor consisting of target pixel and their neighboring pixels is used as input sample, dimension reduction is performed, and a spatial transformer (SpatFormer) is designed to efficiently extract the deep spatial features of HSI data. Consequently, MSST enlarges the receptive field and captures the comprehensive joint spatial-spectral features. Extensive experiments conducted on five widely used HSI datasets demonstrate the superior classification performance of the proposed framework. Our source codes will be available at https://github. com/zhwt-xidian/Multi-Scale-Samples-Transformer_MSST."

    "abstract": "For the last few years, there has been a growing interest in implementing microgrids for space exploration purposes. In this case, optimization is crucial to determine the optimal combination of microgrid components. For microgrid sizing, heuristic algorithms are the most frequently employed techniques around the world. However, they can not guarantee global optimality. In this study, a deterministic optimization approach is employed for the optimal sizing of space-based microgrids for lunar habitats, utilizing the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) algorithm to minimize the Annualized System Cost (ASC). Optimal sizing of the microgrid components varies with the level of nuclear base power. According to the approach, for 200 kW nuclear base power, the optimal solar and battery sizes are 101.19 kW and 9460.37 kWh, respectively. The results are validated through a comparative analysis of the outputs obtained from two widely used heuristic algorithms: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO). Moreover, the sensitivity, statistical and uncertainty analyses are performed in this study. By properly sizing the microgrid components, the cost and weight of the power system components in the space mission can be reduced while maintaining reliability."

While modern ISAs support DLP via SIMD and vector extensions, arithmetic units often remain optimized for latency and do not scale efficiently across parallel workloads. Our approach revisits the microarchitecture of division units by trading latency for area, exposing parallelism through the instantiation of multiple smaller, slower units replicated spatially to exploit data-level parallelism. The framework operates as a high-level generator written in Python, automatically producing synthesizable ASIC designs across multiple floating-point formats and technology nodes. It supports format-agnostic and processagnostic design exploration, enabling rapid evaluation of tradeoffs between latency, area, and power. We validate our contributions through extensive evaluations encompassing 11 floating-point formats, including posits, IEEE754, and recent formats like EXMY, as well as process nodes ranging from 180 nm to 7 nm, demonstrating the scalability of our approach. Notably, area and power reductions reach up to $9.18 \\times$ and $61.28 \\times$, respectively, for Posit64 and IEEE754 double precision. When constraining designs to preserve performance, the best gains reach $3.12 \\times$ and $8.03 \\times$, demonstrating the viability of the approach for parallel workloads and vector datapaths."

    "abstract": "Reduced gravity simulation systems are important for astronaut training because microgravity can have some adverse effects on the human body. However, there is a lack of a small device that can simulate a reduced gravity environment and fewer analyses of the effects of microgravity on the human body. For this reason, we designed a reduced gravity simulation system based on a vertical body weight support system (BWS) and an exoskeleton. The BWS simulates the effects of reduced weight of the whole body by suspending a certain weight. The exoskeleton monitors the angle of the wearer's lower limb joints through a inertial measurement unit net on the body to map the corresponding joint moments, and ultimately realizes the reduced gravity simulation of hip joint. Based on the system described above, we wish to explore the effects of microgravity on human biomechanics while trying to ensure the simulations are as accurate as possible. One subject was recruited to participate in a series of experiment. Walking experiment was conducted at two speeds under three wearing conditions: without the BWS and exoskeleton, with the BWS and with the BWS and exoskeleton. Biomechanical data, including joint angles, joint moments, and muscle activations, were recorded by a motion capture system and surface EMG during the experiments. Based on these measurements, the effects of reduced gravity simulation environment on the walking patterns were mainly in the joint angles, joint moments, muscle activation, and control strategies of the human body. It is worth noting that the activation intensity of some muscles increased by different magnitudes and shifted in phase under the simulation condition compared to the normal. These results were unexpected for us and promising to serve as an inspiration for the future development of astronauts training system.

    "abstract": "In the history of knowledge distillation (KD), the focus has once shifted over time from logit-based to feature-based approaches. However, this transition has been revisited with the advent of decoupled KD (DKD), which reemphasizes the importance of logit knowledge through advanced decoupling and weighting strategies. While DKD marks a significant advancement, its underlying mechanisms merit deeper exploration. As a response, we rethink DKD from a predictive distribution perspective. First, we introduce an enhanced version, the generalized DKD (GDKD) loss, which offers a more versatile method for decoupling logits. Then, we pay particular attention to the teacher model’s predictive distribution and its impact on the gradients of GDKD loss, uncovering two critical insights often overlooked: 1) the partitioning by the top logit considerably improves the interrelationship of nontop logits and 2) amplifying the focus on the distillation loss of nontop logits enhances the knowledge extraction among them. Utilizing these insights, we further propose a streamlined GDKD algorithm with an efficient partition strategy to handle the multimodality of teacher models’ predictive distribution. Our comprehensive experiments conducted on a variety of benchmarks, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet, Tiny-ImageNet, CUB-200-2011, and Cityscapes, demonstrate GDKD’s superior performance over both the original DKD and other leading KD methods.

    "abstract": "The complex three-dimensional (3D) environment in greenhouse agriculture poses high demands on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning, rendering traditional two-dimensional (2D) algorithms insufficient for efficient coverage and dynamic adaptability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Digital Twin (DT)-driven hybrid framework that integrates the Dung Beetle Optimizer (DBO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) with Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) for dynamic 3D UAV coverage path planning in greenhouse environments. Specifically, the DBO algorithm mimics dung beetle foraging behaviors to achieve global exploration, while GA performs local refinement through crossover and mutation. ABM generates dynamic 3D pest heatmaps for hotspot navigation, and the DT module establishes a real-time feedback loop between the physical greenhouse and its virtual replica, ensuring adaptive path correction. DT provides real-time environmental feedback for closed-loop optimization.Simulation experiments in a 15×15×10 m greenhouse model located in Xinzhou, China, demonstrate that the proposed DBO-GA hybrid achieves a 96.8% coverage rate, shortens path length by 32% (to 70.5 m), and reduces computation time by 28% (to 9.8 s) compared with A*, GA, and DBO algorithms. These improvements confirm the framework’s strong balance between global search and local optimization as well as its robustness in complex 3D agricultural environments.This DT–ABM–DBO–GA framework provides an innovative and generalizable approach for precision agriculture, enabling efficient, adaptive, and intelligent UAV path planning in greenhouse operations."

We demonstrate how this approach can be applied to the 3D reconstruction of static volumetric objects. The approach is validated in the real world with a diverse set of relevant objects and we observe that the visual servo scheme produces smooth exploration trajectories that keep the camera focused at the object.

The AMF-induced wavelength shift of the MCOS is mapped to the phase of the OEO oscillating signal leveraging the fiber loop dispersion. High-sensitivity AMF detection can be achieved by demodulating the sampled RF phase of the OEO oscillation signal using the Hilbert transform algorithm. The superior phase noise performance of the OEO enables the system to achieve a high-sensitivity AMF sensing with a magnetic field sensitivity of 4.65nT/Hz<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1/2</sup> at a GMM resonant frequency of 1350 Hz.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an initial investigation into the combination of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and massive communication, both of which are largely regarded as key scenarios in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Specifically, we consider a cell-free network comprising a large number of users, multiple targets, and distributed base stations (BSs). In each time slot, a random subset of users becomes active, transmitting pilot signals that can be scattered by the targets before reaching the BSs. Unlike conventional massive random access schemes, where the primary objectives are device activity detection and channel estimation, our framework also enables target localization by leveraging the multipath propagation effects introduced by the targets. However, due to the intricate dependency between user channels and target locations, characterizing the posterior distribution required for minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimation presents significant computational challenges. To handle this problem, we propose a hybrid message passing-based framework that incorporates multiple approximations to mitigate computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high-accuracy device activity detection, channel estimation, and target localization simultaneously, validating the feasibility of embedding localization functionality into massive communication systems for future 6G networks."

    "abstract": "Rankability differs fundamentally from ranking: while ranking produces a deterministic ordering that may vary slightly based on data feature importance, rankability serves as a measurement function that quantifies the confidence in an obtained ranking. Evaluating a ranking method is inherently challenging, and assessing rankability is even more complex. In recent years, only a few rankability algorithms have been identified in the literature, the first being introduced by Anderson et al. in 2019. Despite its significance, rankability remains underexplored, yet it plays a crucial role in data science applications such as web search, data mining, cybersecurity, and machine learning. Existing approaches often rely on solving eigenvalue problems for large matrices or on training regression models on extensive datasets, which pose computational challenges. In this paper, we introduce a novel rankability measurement method that leverages entropy and variance-efficient, interpretable statistical metrics that address the limitations of existing techniques. Our approach provides computationally efficient rankability assessments, offering a fresh perspective in a domain where there is currently no definitive ground truth or universally accepted methodology. We validate our method using football tournament datasets and demonstrate strong correlation with established ranking systems, including the widely recognized Elo rating method. Notably, our approach aligns closely with these conventional benchmarks, underscoring its practical relevance and validity. As rankability remains an emerging and evolving field of study, our work contributes to the ongoing discovery and development of more sophisticated analytical tools. This research underscores the need for continued community effort and innovation to advance our understanding of rankability in complex systems."

    "abstract": "Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) have become increasingly sophisticated and covert, necessitating the acquisition of an overall view of the rapidly evolving cyber threat landscape by security defenders. However, integrating threat intelligence from diverse sources poses significant challenges due to limited labeled data and noise interference. To address the requirement for the early detection of APT attacks, this paper introduces a lightweight framework named Warning-Graph, based on threat intelligence modeling. Warning-Graph leverages a limited set of IoCs to infer the type of ongoing APT attack. Initially, attack-related infrastructure nodes are modeled as a heterogeneous information network. Subsequently, heterogeneous graph contrastive learning is employed for pre-training. Two asymmetric graph encoders are constructed to obtain node embeddings without the need to generate negative samples or labeled data. In addition, a loss function based on the information bottleneck is specifically employed to reduce the noise in the original graph. In downstream tasks, multiclass classifiers are trained using embedding representations with fewer labeled samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a 3- to 5-point increase in identification performance for APT attack types compared to baselines, while utilizing fewer labeled samples."

To improve carrier efficiency, we choose cellular signal as the carrier due to its continuous transmission nature. Specifically, to ensure low power, we design low-power periodic template matching based on the periodicity of cellular signals to trade time for synchronization accuracy. Further, we calibrate the drift introduced by Sampling Frequency Offset (SFO) to increase carrier utilization. In addition, we exploit Reference Signal (RS)-based demodulation to demodulate tag and ambient data from backscattered signals alone in various traffic patterns for efficient transmission. We prototype HEScatter using off-the-shelf FPGAs and SDRs. Extensive experiments show that HEScatter performs well in carrier utilization, power consumption and data transmission. The carrier utilization rate of HEScatter is as high as 99.97%, which is 3.0x higher than the counterpart of SyncLTE. In end-to-end transmission, the energy efficiency of HEScatter is 1.6x and 19.2x higher than LScatter+ and SyncLTE, while LScatter suffers from transmission failures. We also demonstrate the high transmission efficiency of HEScatter, as its aggregate goodput is 1.5x and 3.8x better than LScatter+ and SyncLTE respectively."

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of global air traffic and the increasing complexity of security threats, aviation safety has become more critical than ever. As a key component of aerospace and electronic systems infrastructure, X-ray imaging systems is critical for ensuring operational safety in air transportation. Consequently, numerous researchs have focused on enhancing object detection performance in X-ray imagery. However, the few-shot fine-grained X-ray item classification (FSFG-XC) tasks has not received sufficient attention. Classifying prohibited items in X-ray screening poses considerable difficulties, mainly because of the high visual similarity among these items in X-ray images. Additionally, factors such as overlapping shapes, shadows, occlusion, and color fading complicate the distinction between items, especially from different viewing angles. In this work, we propose a Foreground Separation Prompt Tuning (FSPT) method to address these challenges. Our method consists of three key components, a Prompt-based Vision Transformer (PVT), an Attention-Based Foreground Separation Module (AFSM), and an Attention-guided Spatial Contrast Module (ASCM). PVT is designed to efficiently adapt tasks by updating only a small number of additional parameters while keeping the pretrained backbone frozen. Subsequently, AFSM mitigates background interference by integrating multi-layer attention mechanisms. ASCM enhances local fine-grained feature discrimination through spatial contrast learning. We also introduce our primary X-ray prohibited items dataset, FineXray, which consists of 3,955 images across 20 categories. This dataset aims to advance FSFG-XC studies in more challenging scenarios. Results from experiments conducted on the FineXray dataset along with widely used fine-grained benchmarks illustrate the superior efficacy of the proposed FSPT in comparison to current methodologies, offering a robust and efficient solution for enhancing intelligent threat recognition capabilities in aviation-focused electronic systems."

Second, the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ResMiniNet</i> CNN architecture, inspired by the ResNet model, reduces trainable parameters by approximately 75% while maintaining competitive accuracy. Combined with Gramian angular field imaging, PWMF-ResMiniNet achieves over 90% F1-score on the GOTOV dataset—the highest reported accuracy on this dataset to date—and demonstrates consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods such as HARDenseCNN and HART on the PAMAP2 and WISDM 2019 datasets. Moreover, the study discusses the limitations of the proposed framework and current HAR approaches, identifies open research challenges, and highlights promising directions for future investigation."

We derive a linear model approximately describing the system phase dynamics, and use it to formulate a Linear Quadratic Integral (LQI) controller capable of phase angle reference tracking. The proposed controller enables the system to be operated as a three-phase balanced source. Unbalanced operation is also desirable when supplying an unbalanced load or injecting auxiliary signals. MATLAB simulations are used to validate the proposed controller and demonstrate performance under nominal and unbalanced conditions. The LQI controller ensures minimal overshoot, zero steady-state error, and robust reference tracking in both the linearized and nonlinear model used to derive it. The results exemplify the flexibility of the controller tuning for precise shaping of system response, which is essential for adapting inverter-based resources (IBRs) to grid protection requirements."

    "abstract": "In an islanded microgrid supplied by virtual synchronous generator (VSG) based inverter-based resources (IBRs), inter-IBR oscillations pose a serious threat to frequency stability and power-sharing accuracy. While VSG control enables gridforming inverters (GFMs) to emulate inertia and improve frequency dynamics, it also introduces poorly damped modes. This paper proposes a distributed cooperative control strategy that enhances damping of inter-IBR oscillations without compromising key frequency performance metrics such as the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and frequency nadir. The proposed control introduces a dynamic state variable that adjusts the auxiliary frequency reference in real-time based on both local frequency error and a distributed feedback term derived from the mismatch in normalized active power among neighboring inverters, thereby enhancing damping and actively suppressing inter-IBR oscillations. In addition, the control incorporates normalized active power mismatch to achieve proportional load sharing, implemented using a sparse communication topology among neighboring IBRs. An eigenvalue analysis based on small-signal model is conducted for appropriate selection of control gains to achieve system stability. Simulation results under various IBR configurations demonstrate that the proposed control method effectively suppresses inter-IBR oscillations, ensures proportional power sharing, and achieves robustness. Accordingly, the applicability of the proposed control design is validated for both homogeneous and heterogeneous VSG systems."

The research problem revolves around the inefficiencies of traditional irrigation methods, leading to water wastage and suboptimal crop yields. The primary objective of this research is to develop a reliable and energy-efficient system that utilizes a diverse array of sensors, including soil moisture, rain detection, temperature, humidity, current sensor, and LDR, to monitor real-time field conditions accurately. By leveraging IoT innovations, users can remotely monitor the system through a mobile app or website, receiving wireless alerts for anomalies. The monitoring web app is made of Next.Js, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, and MySQL databases. A LoRa communication system overcomes spatial limitations with a coverage range of approximately 10 km. The system employs motor control actions that dynamically adjust to changing weather conditions, and water level sensors prevent motors from running dry, enhancing overall operational efficiency. Furthermore, a current sensor accurately detects motor operation status. The results showcase the system's viability and efficiency in adapting to agricultural contexts, emphasizing its potential to optimize irrigation practices. Additionally, GSM technology facilitates on site mobile data and SMS notifications for crucial updates. Real-time data collected during deployment validates the system's effectiveness."

This method uses a multi-scale feature decoupling mechanism, employs grouped time-domain convolution to capture the transient response and steady-state contraction mode of the electromyogram signal, combines point-wise convolution to achieve feature fusion in the channel dimension, and reduces the parameter quantity by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{7 2. 6} \\boldsymbol{\\%}$</tex> compared to traditional CNN and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 4. 9 \\%}$</tex> compared to CNN-LSTM models. To further optimize feature representation, an efficient channel attention module (ECA) is introduced. Through global time-domain average pooling and gated convolution to dynamically calibrate the weights of key channels, noise interference is suppressed. The experiment uses a selfbuilt healthy subject gesture dataset for verification. The model achieves an algorithm accuracy of 96.8% in the classification of four basic rehabilitation gestures. The actual test deployed on the Raspberry Pi 4B platform shows that the system achieves a real-time classification success rate of 92.1% among three volunteers and a single-frame inference latency of no more than 23 ms. This provides a new solution for wearable rehabilitation assistance and evaluation."

To take advantage of the performance benefits of these platforms, software engineers rely on multithreading libraries to implement parallel applications. While multithreaded applications present power efficiency and performance gains when executed in multicore platforms, their susceptibility to radiation-induced soft errors remains an underexplored issue. In this regard, this paper investigates the impact of multithreading libraries on the soft error reliability of a real-time application running on a multicore Arm processor. Results reveal a strong correlation between certain sets of registers (e.g., x19-x28) and the occurrence of crashes and silent data corruption (SDC). Results also show how compiler optimisation and the number of worker threads influence the system’s performance, real-time reliability, memory usage, and soft error reliability. For instance, while the benchmark with a single worker thread is the most reliable, this configuration fails to meet its timing constraint (i.e., deadlines)."

Expanding these domains requires addressing safety assurance under diverse conditions. Information sharing through vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, enabled by a Dynamic Map platform built from vehicle and roadside sensor data, offers a promising solution. Real-world experiments with numerous infrastructure sensors incur high costs and regulatory challenges. Conventional single-host simulators lack the capacity for large-scale urban traffic scenarios. This paper proposes DAWSIM, a distributed simulator that partitions its workload across multiple machines to support the simulation of extensive sensor deployment and dense traffic environments. A Dynamic Map generation framework on D-AWSIM enables researchers to explore information-sharing strategies without relying on physical testbeds. The evaluation shows that D-AWSIM increases throughput for vehicle count and LiDAR sensor processing substantially compared to a single-machine setup. Integration with Autoware demonstrates applicability for autonomous driving research."

This paper proposes a standardized and scalable approach to the modeling of renewable energy assets data using the IEC 61850 Substation Configuration Language (SCL). Using SCL’s structured data modeling capabilities, the proposed method enables a consistent representation of devices and site hierarchies, facilitating automated integration into third-party EMS applications and monitoring platforms. The approach improves interoperability, reduces configuration effort, and improves maintainability in large renewable portfolios."

    "abstract": "Despite the huge investment capital requirement of wind power projects. It is still considered one of the most viable renewable energy sources that could speed up the global net-zero ambition. However, governments across nations are supporting this campaign by initiating different subsidy schemes such as carbon tax and wind subsidies that could encourage the uptake of wind power and retire coal power plants. But this often comes with some economic implications, such as increased electricity prices and fluctuating revenues, making the decision on how to choose an appropriate capacity or scaling extremely difficult, especially for system planners and power generation investors. This study investigates the wind potential of a wind-penetrated power grid as a step towards the de-carbonization of the grid. A unit commitment mixed-integer linear programming optimization problem has been formulated to investigate the integration of different wind capacities in the system under a carbon tax and wind subsidy towards the retirement of coal plants . The study then analyzes the economic potential of the different regimes based on profit generated, operation cost, and electricity prices. The results show that tax incentives or wind subsidies for wind and carbon taxes encourage wind projects but shift the cost burdens in terms of electricity price to the consumers and reduce the overall investment revenue under aggressive retirement of coal power plants that could drive massive de-carbonization."

    "abstract": "Kriging-assisted system reliability assessment has been extensively investigated and is widely recognized for its superior performance, particularly when integrated with active learning strategies. However, most existing methods focus primarily on the misclassification probability of the current state, neglecting the future global effect of newly added samples on the failure probability estimation. To overcome this limitation, a novel look-ahead learning strategy called stepwise error reduction (SER) is proposed for accelerating system reliability assessment. SER aims to iteratively select the point with the largest difference between the current system error and the expected future system error. The SER framework consists of three main components. First, a real-time system error measurement method applicable to arbitrary systems is developed. Second, by combining the Kriging update formulas and total probability theorem, the expected future misclassification probabilities for different systems are derived. Then, two critical components of active learning, i.e., learning function and stopping criterion, are developed with the system error information. Third, to further enhance computational efficiency, a candidate sample pruning strategy is introduced according to system characteristics. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated on three numerical examples and one real-world engineering problem. Experiment results show that the proposed method can enhance the efficiency and accuracy for the system reliability assessment."

    "abstract": "Robots made from soft and compliant materials offer a promising alternative to traditional rigid robots, particularly in human–robot collaborative environments due to their inherent safety. Pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) play a critical role in this field, serving as compliant actuators capable of generating substantial forces. However, this type of actuator still faces challenges in generating bidirectional force over a large range of motion. In this article, we introduce a three-dimensional (3-D)-printed PAM with a telescopic structure using a nested structure. The actuator's large volumetric deformation enables it to generate high bidirectional forces using positive and negative pressures, while also providing a wide range of motion with significant extension and contraction ratios. The use of 3-D printing not only simplifies the design and fabrication process but also offers significant advantages in mass production and industrial implementation. The proposed actuator can generate an extension blocked force of 659 N with an extension ratio of 447.1% and contract with payloads up to 7 kg up to a contraction ratio of 76.9%. A rotational configuration of the actuator is also presented with a blocked torque of 18.5 Nm. These actuators were then implemented into grippers and extendable links for robotic manipulators."

    "abstract": "Mental Health Literacy (MHL) is a multidimensional aspect that addresses barriers to seeking professional help. Strong MHL enables individuals to identify mental health challenges and seek professional support if required. Although its importance is widely recognized, there is a significant gap in the design of targeted interventions considering modifiable factors. This study offered a decision support framework that assessed multiple dimensions of MHL and segmented individuals within academic communities based on modifiable predictors that can be amenable to change through educational interventions. The user study was conducted using a cross-sectional survey of 385 participants, representing diverse academic roles. Five latent profiles were identified, each reflecting distinct configurations of help-seeking attitude, knowledge, and beliefs related to mental illness using Latent Profile Analysis. The study compared decision tree classifiers (C5.0, CART, and Conditional Inference Trees) to generate decision rules tailored to each profile, ensuring interpretability and practical utility. Interactions between MHL profiles and demographic variables are visualized through an interactive POWER BI dashboard. This framework provides actionable insights to policymakers and health professionals for targeted resource allocation, precise intervention design, and longitudinal tracking of profile evaluation, thereby enhancing institutional mental healthcare."

    "abstract": "Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is a challenging task that aims to identify both seen and novel categories in unlabeled data. We argue that a clear margin between seen and novel class representations is essential for accurate recognition. However, existing methods often ignore this margin, mapping representations to prototypes without enforcing separation between seen and novel classes. This leads to a bias where seen samples are misclassified as novel. To address this issue, we propose DebiasGCD, a debiasing framework that enhances prototype separation through margin-aware learning. Unlike prior work that relies on static prototype learning and overlooks fine-grained representations, our method introduces Dynamic Prototype Debiasing (DPD) and Spatial-Aware Representation Distillation (SARD) to mitigate this bias. First, DPD dynamically enforces inter-prototype margins, improving class-specific feature learning and prototype discrimination. Meanwhile, SARD promotes local representation of spatial learning, supporting DPD to capture subtle details that further refine class-specific features. By synergizing these components, DebiasGCD significantly improves prototype discriminability, generating more reliable predictions for seen classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates pseudo-labeling bias across datasets, especially on fine-grained ones, achieving +8.3% and +9.6% improvements on the ‘All’ classes in CUB and Stanford Cars, respectively."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven remarkable progress across diverse NLP benchmarks. However, the application of these models to sophisticated domains such as wireless communications raises new challenges. This paper addresses the evaluation gap for LLMs in telecommunications by introducing Last Dance of Telecommunications (LDOT) – a comprehensive benchmark suite for telecom-related tasks. LDOT encompasses a broad range of problem categories, including conceptual telecom questions, mathematical and logical reasoning problems, and complex network optimization scenarios, specifically designed to challenging LLMs’ high-level reasoning and domain-specific knowledge. Using LDOT, we rigorously assess state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs (both closed-source and open-source) on domain-specific tasks. Our results reveal that while general-purpose LLMs exhibit strong performance on basic telecom knowledge questions, they struggle with reasoning-intensive wireless problems. Notably, certain multi-step optimization and planning tasks in LDOT remain unsolved by even the best models, exposing performance gaps that are not apparent from existing saturated benchmarks. We provide a detailed failure analysis to pinpoint whether these limitations arise from insufficient telecom-specific knowledge or from inadequate reasoning capabilities. The LDOT dataset and our evaluation findings aim to facilitate the development of more robust domain-adapted LLMs for next-generation wireless communications."

In order to achieve miniaturization of LPF based on SISL technology, firstly, we designed a periodic bone-shaped metasubstrate with a high effective permittivity of larger than 10. Based on the metasubstrate structure, we can also significantly reduce the size of conventional capacitors. Then we designed a 3D inductor to achieve high <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Q</i>-factor while also realizing a compact design of the inductor. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of our proposed concept and the design methods for miniaturizing capacitors and inductors, three LPFs with a cutoff frequency of 100 MHz are designed, containing the SISL LPF with 2D inductors without metasubstrate, the SISL 2D inductors and double-layer metasubstrates LPF, and the SISL 3D inductors and double-layer metasubstrates LPF. Compared with the SISL LPF with 2D inductors without metasubstrate, the SISL 2D inductors and double-layer metasubstrates LPF shows a size reduction of 84.4% due to the double-layer metasubstrates. Moreover, the proposed LPF designed on the SISL 3D inductors and double-layer metasubstrates using FR4 shows a compact size of 0.01 λg × 0.006 λg × 0.002 λg with a size reduction of 86.2% due to the designed double-layer metasubstrates and 3D inductors, stopband rejection better than 40 dB up to 14.2 <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f<sub>c</sub></i>, and low loss of less than 0.15 dB with self-packaging advantage."

    "abstract": "Transformers are employed in renewable energy systems such as wind and solar power generation for stepping up the voltage supplied to the grid. They are known to have higher failure rates compared to grid transformers, as they are exposed to a hostile environment and fluctuating operating conditions. However, testing relies on on-site tests, which are costly to perform as they are installed in remote locations that are difficult to access. In this paper, a new approach for transformer testing using the inverter available in the system, is proposed. The main idea is to use the inverter as the test equipment for injecting test signals into the transformer low voltage (LV) winding to obtain the frequency response of admittance for detecting faults whenever the renewable energy system is de-energized. An equivalent circuit analysis is given to show that defects in the core, winding, insulation, and LCL filter can be detected from the change in admittance over a wide frequency range, similar to frequency response analysis (FRA) commonly used for transformer testing. Experimental test results of the proposed method and FRA performed on a 380/690V, 15 kVA, 3 phase transformer are given under emulated core insulation failure, insulation contamination, and poor electrical contacts for validation."

    "abstract": "Conforming to safety standards often limits collaborative robots' performance and size, restricting their applications despite their capabilities. Planning their motions in human environments involves a trade-off between optimal trajectory planning and quick adaptation to dynamic, unstructured spaces. Traditional trajectory planning methods either use simplified robot models and sacrifice robot's abilities for computational efficiency, or exploit robots' abilities fully but have high computational complexity and rely on substantial pre-computation. This paper introduces an approach for trajectory planning that exploits robot's full motion abilities while planning on-the-fly. In each step of the trajectory execution, it evaluates robot's movement ability using polytope algebra and calculates a time-optimal Trapezoidal Acceleration Profile (TAP) on the remaining trajectory. The method is shown to be near time-optimal (around 5% slower trajectories) by benchmarking it against the state-of-the-art time-optimal method TOPP-RA. The method allows reaching higher velocities (able to plan up to 100% of the robot's kinematic limits) while at the same time lowering the tracking error (under 4mm) than traditional Cartesian Space planning methods. A mock-up experiment demonstrates its efficiency in collaborative waste sorting using a Franka Emika Panda robot."

The central challenge is domain mismatch, a problem that remains largely unexplored in speech steganalysis. To fill the gap, this letter proposes a novel multi-source domain adaptation method called Fuzzy Clustering-Based Domain Adaptation (FCDA). First, to enable effective clustering of samples with similar actual EBS, FCDA employs Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering, allowing soft estimation across multiple Embedding Rate (EBR) levels. Second, to enhance the steganographic classification performance, we construct the backbone network integrating a dual-primary classifier with an auxiliary EBR hierarchy classifier, which leverages the strength-sensitive representation. Third, to better realize the training of multi-objective tasks and enhance feature discriminability, the domain-consistent optimization loss is introduced. Experimental results show that FCDA outperforms state-of-the-art steganalysis methods and multi-source domain adaptation methods."

In this paper, We propose a rational delegation learning smart contract scheme (SCS-RDL). First, it combines game theory to construct a rational delegation learning framework and introduces a blockchain-based probabilistic verification method. Second, we construct a smart contract scheme and design rational utility functions that effectively incentivize participants’ honest behavior. Finally, experiments demonstrate that SCS-RDL scheme could enhance delegation learning’s training efficiency without sacrificing accuracy and could satisfy public verifiability."

The work presented in this paper demonstrates a method to calculate contingency probabilities for use in reliability analysis and examine traditional contingency analysis. We also examine resource adequacy, and risk-based contingency analysis, illustrating their application to decisions in operations, operational planning, and long-term planning."

The operating conditions of a distribution grid are time-varying due to the fluctuation of distributed energy resource (DER) output and load demand. Therefore, static or one-time setting of SIs’ droops may not work for maintaining the nodal voltages on a distribution feeder over a duration of time. In this context, this work puts forward a Neural Network (NN)-based approach to dynamically adjust droop settings of SIs in response to the variation of DER power and load demand. The performance of NN is demonstrated using the large-scale IEEE 8500-node test feeder. The predicted SI droop settings align close with the ground truth values, which highlights the usefulness of the proposed adaptive droop setting for effective voltage regulation on Active Distribution Networks (ADNs) as the operating condition varies."

The model minimizes a composite cost function including maintenance and generation costs, as well as penalties for delayed maintenance, while satisfying N−1 security constraints, operational limits, and crew availability. Case studies on the IEEE 300-bus test system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in producing feasible and cost-effective maintenance schedules. To address scalability and combinatorial complexity, the model is mapped into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, enabling exploration of solution approaches based on Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE). While the QUBO reformulation provides a foundation for future quantum-inspired optimization, this study focuses primarily on the development and demonstration of the classical optimization framework and illustrates the potential applicability of QITE in large-scale maintenance scheduling."

While formal verification is required to prove 100% correctness of the circuit, state-of-the-art methods fail to provide bounds for the resource and time consumption of the verification.We introduce an automated approach for formally verifying an IEEE-754-compliant floating-point multiplier with polynomial bound complexity. While state-of-the-art verification approaches based on SAT and Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) fail, our technique based on an adapted symbolic simulation using BDDs enables a fast and predictable verification process. Extensive case splitting is performed to prevent exponential BDD growth. The applicability is proven by verifying a single precision floating-point multiplier used in a popular floating-point unit."

    "abstract": "Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) play a pivotal role in critical infrastructure, making their safety crucial for the stable operation of modern society. In recent years, ICSs have become increasingly targets of cyberattacks, which pose serious threats to their stability and reliability. Existing attack detection approaches, however, suffer from significant limitations, such as the low interpretability of deep learning models and the challenges involved in constructing comprehensive physical mechanism models. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel anomaly detection method based on invariant rules. By leveraging system design knowledge and key production indicators, we construct partial process invariants that capture the underlying physical consistency of the system. Additionally, control invariants are extracted based on the logical relationships between sensors and actuators as defined by the control logic. To reduce the impact of noise and mitigate false positives during the detection phase, we introduce a window-based filtering mechanism that treats shortterm fluctuations as transient disturbances rather than actual anomalies. By continuously monitoring whether material flows and control signals violate the defined invariants, the system can effectively detect potential cyberattacks. Experimental results on the SWaT dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving a recall of $73.39 \\%$ and an F1 score of $83.06 \\%$, thereby validating its robust detection capability."

We propose a Weather-Adaptive Solar Resilience Framework (WASRF) that integrates weather classification with pattern-specific PV prediction and a Markov-chain battery-control scheme. Four tailored regression models capture distinct weather-irradiance relationships, while transition probabilities proactively adjust charge/discharge set-points during recovery periods. WASRF was validated on IEEE 34-bus and IEEE 123-bus feeders using Gulf-Coast weather data across three disaster scenarios. Compared with conventional approaches, WASRF significantly improves PV forecast accuracy, maintains higher battery state-of-charge levels, and eliminates periods below critical reserve thresholds. System-level resilience improves with substantial reductions in Expected Unserved Energy and increases in Critical Load Support, with the largest gains during tropical cyclone scenarios. These results demonstrate that weather-adaptive forecasting and control markedly enhance post-disaster microgrid resilience."

The linear actuator constructs a triangular mechanism with variable side length through ball screw. This realizes the variable reduction ratio characteristics of the joint. Compared with fixed reduction ratio, it provides higher torque output when taking off and better cushioning performance when landing. The introduced parallel spring mechanism works synergistically with the linear actuator, which effectively reduces the torque demand of motor, thereby enhancing the overall reliability of the system.

Data from 542 respondents were analyzed using six machine learning techniques: Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), Gradient Boosting (GRB), XGBoost (XGB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).Results indicate that DT achieved the highest accuracy (0.93) and precision (0.94), while RF obtained the highest AUC-ROC score (0.98). Analysis of feature importance revealed that PE and EE were the most significant predictors of adoption, followed by TR and GS. These findings provide valuable insights for platform developers to prioritize usability and performance improvements, and for policymakers to strengthen trust and government support.

    "abstract": "Federated learning has gained widespread adoption in mobile networks due to its ability to collaboratively train global models without centralized data collection. However, as the number of terminal devices grows, involving all clients in every training round becomes impractical. Existing client selection strategies often prioritize devices with superior computational resources and lower latency, inadvertently excluding weaker clients and allowing dominant ones to monopolize training opportunities. This bias not only undermines fairness but also reduces model accuracy and generalization by limiting data diversity. To address these challenges, we propose a grouping-based federated learning framework with provable fairness guarantees. Our approach leverages multi-armed bandit (MAB) techniques to dynamically cluster clients by capability, ensuring balanced participation while enhancing training efficiency. Within each group, we design a Pareto-optimal client selection strategy that jointly optimizes fairness (quantified via participation variance) and communication efficiency (measured using Shannon’s entropy). Extensive theoretical analysis and real-world experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly improves both fairness and model performance compared to conventional approaches."

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become an essential tool in the domain of vision processing. However, dedicated accelerators are needed for energy-efficient execution of these networks, especially for embedded devices with tight energy constraints. Integrating multiple of these accelerators via chiplets promises a way to scale up the performance of these emerging systems by partitioning a neural network across multiple accelerators. This approach enables the execution of different layers on an accelerator with the best-suited dataflow. However, partitioning a neural network is a non-trivial task, especially when different accelerator architectures must be considered. In this paper, we propose our framework DSEParted, which automates the co-design of network partitioning and hardware architecture optimization. It employs a hierarchical optimization approach to gradually reduce the number of design candidates until an optimal system configuration is found for a partitioned computation of a neural network. We demonstrate that our framework can design a system that, for GoogLeNet, reduces latency by 22.5% when optimizing for latency. In addition, when optimizing for energy, it reduces the system area by 7.9%, with no impact on latency or energy compared to a baseline system. Further, we show that our partitioning-aware pruning strategy can reduce the EDP of the system by up to 49.7% in the case of ResNeXt-50, compared to a strategy that only optimizes the accelerators individually. Through the provided information, designers receive feedback on the efficiency of the full system at an early development stage.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a cost-effective IoT-based environmental monitoring system tailored for rural Bangladesh. The design places a special focus on particulate dust levels alongside key weather parameters, addressing an often overlooked factor in precision agriculture. The system integrates sensors for air quality such as dust concentration, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and light intensity. An ESP32 microcontroller aggregates these data and transmits them via MQTT to a cloud server, enabling real-time remote access through a web dashboard. By providing farmers with timely, sitespecific environmental data, the system empowers data-driven decisions for optimizing irrigation scheduling, proactive pest and disease management, and adaptive crop planning under changing weather conditions. A field pilot demonstrates the system's effectiveness: farmers achieved more efficient water use, improved pest control, and took preventive measures during high dust events, resulting in notable water savings and better crop protection. The solution is low-cost, easy to deploy, and low-maintenance, making it feasible for widespread adoption by smallholder farmers. Overall, the system helps improve agricultural productivity and sustainability in the face of climate change and environmental pollution, contributing to the socio-economic development of Bangladesh's rural farming communities."

This paper introduces BrainFormer, a novel electroencephalography (EEG)-based deep learning model combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer architectures to classify neural signals with high precision. Specifically, BrainFormer targets two critical biomarkers for stroke rehabilitation: (1) Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) for detecting visual attention and (2) alpha wave suppression as an indicator of motor-related cortical activation. The model achieves 92% accuracy in SSVEP classification and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 0 0 \\%}$</tex> accuracy in binary detection of alpha wave suppression, demonstrating its robustness for EEG decoding. Furthermore, a low-cost, portable 16r-channel EEG acquisition system is introduced and designed for clinical and home use, enabling scalable implementation.

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) grasping systems have expanded the range of UAV applications, such as item delivery, dynamic perching, infrastructure inspection, search and rescue operations, industrial maintenance, precision agriculture, scientific sampling. However, prevalent gripper-based and fixture-based mechanisms are limited by restricted applicability, potential for causing significant mechanical stress on targets, and high demands on target properties. This study presents and fabricates a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE)-based adhesive patch for UAV grasping. Utilizing the pronounced temperature-dependent viscoelasticity changes of LCE, the patch enables stable adhesive grasping and controllable, heat-triggered release of objects. The LCE adhesive patch is synthesized through an efficient one-step click chemistry reaction and can be customized for diverse scenarios using a molding technique, facilitating its easy deployment on various UAV platforms. Only a simple heating module is required to actuate the adhesion/release cycle. This novel adhesive grasping mechanism, characterized by deployment flexibility and grasping reliability, broadens the application scope of UAV grasping systems significantly, offering innovative solutions for tasks including object retrieval, precision delivery, and dynamic perching."

This paper provides a comparative analysis of two feature extraction methods - Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) - in the context of the Yelp dataset body for the detection of deceptive reviews. We have tested different classical machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, and XGBoost with two feature sets. It can be observed that TF-IDF provides a strong baseline that produces well-balanced precision, recall, and F 1 -scores for all the classifiers. Additionally, BERT embeddings, which represent rich contextual semantics, significantly boost detection accuracy, particularly for Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, with F1-scores up to 0.93. However, weaker models like the Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbors have reduced effectiveness with BERT features, possibly because these features are high-dimensional. Our results suggest that transformer Embeddings indeed are effective in improving the fake review detection, and they encourage future studies on the hybrid models and fine-tuning techniques."

    "abstract": "The growing complexity of OT architectures and the rise of semantic attacks on industrial processes require new cyber deception mechanisms. Traditional honeypots capture attacker actions but lack realism. They fail to reproduce the business logic and dynamics of complex industrial environments. This article presents a new type of industrial honeypot, based on a business ontology and closely associated with a digital twin. The ontology, built according to OWL (Web Ontology Language) and SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) standards, allows for the accurate representation of equipment, their interactions, and rules specific to industrial operations. Thanks to this model, an inference engine can analyze and understand the intentions of attackers to provide realistic responses consistent with the operational context. At the same time, the digital twin ensures the temporal and dynamic consistency of the simulated responses. Experimental validation carried out on an OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) environment shows that this approach improves the credibility of the honeypot (Honeyscore = 0.2), improves the detection of semantic anomalies, and increases resistance to fingerprinting techniques. This contribution opens the prospect of intelligent, adaptive, and integrated honeypots capable of strengthening the cyber resilience of critical industrial infrastructures."

While many attacks on this processing pipeline are known, their impact is often evaluated on generic, non-automotive Machine Learning models. Although such models are still widely used in research, a realistic attack evaluation is not possible with them. A central problem for security researchers is the lack of realistic open-source Machine Learning models that represent autonomous driving functionalities. In our work, we propose CATI, an open-source framework to evaluate attacks on cameras in autonomous vehicles. Besides two trained models for automotive object detection and traffic sign detection, it is designed to be modular to include further models for other tasks. The two integrated models are specifically trained versions of the established object detection model YOLO. We show different attacks that successfully trick commonly available implementations of YOLO but not our trained models. Additionally, we highlight how the model robustness benefits in challenging real-world scenarios."

    "abstract": "ORB-SLAM3 is a state-of-the-art visual SLAM system, but its computational complexity poses major challenges for real-time deployment on embedded platforms. While prior work has largely focused on accelerating front-end tasks like feature extraction, back-end stages such as bundle adjustment remain less explored due to their algorithmic complexity and memory-intensive nature. Furthermore, most existing solutions accelerate specific modules without integrating them into a complete SLAM framework. In this work, we present SoC-SLAM, a novel FPGA-based hardware/software co-design that accelerates both the front-end and back-end stages of ORB-SLAM3 within a unified framework. Profiling identifies ORB feature extraction and local bundle adjustment as the primary performance bottlenecks, both critical for maintaining real-time system responsiveness. To address these, we develop modular FPGA-based accelerators for ORB extraction and key bundle adjustment solver steps, including Schur elimination, Cholesky decomposition, and back substitution, while retaining the remaining pipeline in software. Since the workload predominantly consists of operations on sparse block matrices, we develop and combine several optimization techniques, including matrix partitioning and pipelined block processing, to efficiently handle sparsity and maximize parallelism. Evaluation on the EuRoC MAV dataset shows $8 \\times$ and $7.4 \\times$ speedups for ORB extraction and local bundle adjustment, resulting in $2.4 \\times$ and $3.3 \\times$ improvements in the Tracking and Local Mapping threads, respectively. The system operates at 222 MHz, consumes 4.276 W, and achieves an RMSE of 0.02832 m. Our fully integrated pipeline demonstrates competitive performance and power efficiency compared to prior FPGA, ASIC, and GPU-based solutions. The proposed architecture is scalable and generalizable to other bundle adjustment modules, such as global bundle adjustment, welding bundle adjustment, and essential graph optimization, offering an extensible hardware acceleration design for real-time visual SLAM on resource-constrained platforms."

Hourly BESS charging/discharging decisions are optimized in a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) framework: as time progresses, a) hourly decisions are continuously made; b) forecasts of future solar generation are continuously updated, and c) based on the updated forecasts, scenarios of solar generation in the prediction horizon are repeatedly generated and used as input to the stochastic MPC. Based on the entire trajectory of the optimized BESS charging/discharging decisions, realistic BESS degradation models are employed to accurately evaluate the degradation impact of these decisions. Based on both the entire revenue/payments stream and the degradation process until the end-of-life of a BESS, Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is employed as a universal metric to evaluate the return on investment of the BESS, which fairly compares BESS with different a) specifications and b) lifetimes resulting from its decision history. Based on simulations of optimized BESS operations with real-world data, an accurate and comprehensive economic analysis of a wide variety of BESS specifications is conducted. Optimal BESS sizing that achieves the highest IRR is identified."

In this work, we present a comprehensive and extensible framework that enables early evaluation of DNN reliability purely at the Python software level, supporting arbitrary user-defined models and datasets. The framework systematically incorporates the effects of aforementioned optimization techniques and introduces integrated error mitigation strategies to assess their effectiveness pre-hardware deployment. To bridge software-level evaluation with hardware implementation, we extend our framework to a hardware/software codesign platform featuring a configurable systolic array on FPGA. This array, enhanced with built-in fault mitigation mechanisms, accelerates convolution and linear layers, while an ARM CPU core completes the remaining inference tasks. The proposed system achieves resilient DNN inference with a 2.2% increase in FPGA LUT utilization (for LeNet-5 on MNIST). By enabling early-stage analysis and optimization, our approach facilitates robust and resource-efficient DNN deployment for edge AI applications."

    "abstract": "Fault detection and protection is one of the challenging tasks in a power system, especially when integrated with microgrids. This is due to frequent changes in topology and variations in the short-circuit level, which affect the overcurrent grading of the relays. However, machine learning (ML) has been found to be effective in such scenarios. This article proposes an adaptive intelligent fault detection and classification method that dynamically integrates three learning models, adjusting their contributions based on performance under various conditions. This approach simplifies the system by utilizing novel data labeling for fault line detection and localization with a light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) model, thus reducing complexity and response time. The current, measured as data input, is decomposed using wavelet packet decomposition (WPD). The standard deviation and energy are calculated from the wavelet coefficients, which serve as features for training the models. The proposed method effectively addresses challenges in hybrid microgrids, achieving: 1) 99.35% accuracy in fault detection and classification and 2) 99.99% accuracy in identifying faulty lines and their locations. It offers a precise and adaptable solution for simulated data, outperforming conventional protection strategies."

The model integrates vertebral shape encoding and employs separate decoding branches for surface and internal nodes. It was trained on 3,960 synthetic L1 vertebrae generated via data augmentation from 42 real computed tomography (CT) scans. Evaluation on independent test samples yielded a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0596 MPa and an R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> of 0.864 for von Mises stress.

Herein, we present the first sustainable, fully recyclable, and reprogrammable microwave sensing resonator, based on liquid metal and additively manufactured, modular multilayered fluidic channels. The proposed structure leverages a capacitively coupled 3D-printed liquid resonator layer over a microstrip transmission line layer, with additional sensing layers integrated vertically above the recodable identification liquid Galinstan resonators. The resonators’ layer and its subsequent sensing layers are printed using semi-transparent stereolithography (SLA) resin. Five identification bits are implemented using refillable resonators, allowing the resonator to be recoded by filling or emptying liquid metal within different channels. Circularity is demonstrated over 12 cycles, with the liquid metal recovered with under 1.5% waste at the end of life. The encoding and sensing notch filters are implemented using five bandstop resonators at 2–7 GHz. The resonator is demonstrated in two exemplary sensing applications, including real-permittivity-based liquid detection and touch sensing, showing the potential uses in human–RFID interaction."

The PASS dynamically adjusts the locations of pinching antennas (PAs) along dielectric waveguides, which enables pinching beamforming to enhance coverage, reduce path loss, and improve ISAC performance. To enhance both communication and sensing performance, the pinching beamforming, PA activation states, and waveguide power allocation are jointly optimized. This is formulated as a mixed-integer optimization problem that maximizes the average communication rate while satisfying sensing SNR constraints. An enhanced proximal policy optimization algorithm is developed to tackle this sequential decision-making problem. The PAs and waveguides are treated as trainable agents, which explore dedicated policies using distinct actor networks, and determine their decisions based on a shared environment representation. The mixed-integer actions are obtained through probabilistic mapping and projection. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed framework in delivering high-mobility and reliable ISAC services, achieving around 36% improvement in average communication spectral efficiency compared to conventional multi-antenna systems."

However, current research faces limitations in modeling both global structural information and local texture details, as well as in effectively decoupling the two types of representations. To address these issues, this paper proposes DGPNet, a dual-branch network based on multi-level feature distillation and global-local prototype decoupling. Specifically, the Mamba branch captures global structural representations, while the CNN branch focuses on local texture representations. Through multi-level feature distillation with learnable global and local prototypes, the model achieves generalized normal pattern modeling, while an adaptive fusion distillation mechanism further enhances the consistency between representations and prototypes. Further-more, the global-local prototype decoupling, implemented via frequency band division, same-frequency dissimilarity, and global decorrelation, reduces redundancy and overlap between global and local prototypes, further enhancing discriminability of global-local representations. Experimental results on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DGPNet achieves higher diagnosis accuracy than state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating improved generalization and robustness."

Two quantitative analysis methods are proposed: (1) skewness is computed from time-series magnetic angles to evaluate waveform asymmetry; and (2) an ellipse fitting method is applied to the trajectory projected onto a principal plane to extract geometric features such as area, axis ratio, and inclination. Experimental results demonstrate that both methods effectively detect deviations in the joint’s center position.

However, the slender morphology, blurred boundaries, and sparse pixel distribution of cracks pose significant challenges, leading to limited accuracy and robustness in existing approaches. To tackle these challenges, we propose an improved SegFormer framework, termed CrackFormer, to enhance boundary precision and overall segmentation performance. Firstly, a boundary-enhanced dual-branch supervision strategy is introduced by incorporating an auxiliary edge branch alongside the primary segmentation branch, enabling the model to learn boundary features explicitly. Furthermore, a high-resolution enhanced decoder is designed to fuse shallow detail features and integrate strip convolution, thereby improving the continuity and integrity of slender crack structures. Finally, an imbalance-aware composite loss function is developed by combining Focal Loss, Dice Loss, and Boundary Loss, which effectively mitigates the class imbalance problem and optimizes boundary prediction. Comprehensive evaluations across four benchmark datasets show that CrackFormer reliably surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and boundary coherence, validating its effectiveness and application potential for crack segmentation tasks."

Unlike conventional fixed-frequency tag antennas, the proposed design introduces multi-parameter tuning flexibility through a single folded patch structure. The antenna incorporates two symmetrically positioned radiating patches on the top surface, generating a broadside radiation pattern above the metallic plate and achieving a stable and efficient operation with a power transmission coefficient of approximately 99%. The tag is lightweight and easy to fabricate using flexible foam and polyimide substrates, making it practical for real-world applications. Moreover, the resonant frequency can be precisely adjusted across 860-960 MHz, covering the entire global UHF RFID passband, by varying both the meandered slot width and the patch serrations, enabling robust frequency control without geometric complexity. Experimental testing was carried out by placing the antenna on a 20 cm × 20 cm metal plate. With 4W effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP), the antenna demonstrated a long read range of approximately 14 m in the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">xz</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">yz</i> planes and around 10 m in the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">xy</i> plane.

    "abstract": "As mobile edge computing technology advances rapidly, latency-sensitive and resource-intensive applications are being offloaded to edge servers to enhance Quality of Service (QoS) for users. Traditional monolithic architectures, however, struggle to meet the escalating service and traffic requirements of distributed users due to their inherent inflexibility. In response to these challenges, microservices architecture, characterized by scalability and flexibility, has been adopted for dynamic deployment at the network edge. However, the deployment of these lightweight, dependency-rich components in a way that minimally impacts the makespan and maximizes quality of service is complex. Current studies often overlook the deployment of microservices with specific dependencies within constrained environments of edge server clusters and communication links. This paper introduces practical and effective strategies for the deployment and updating of microservices, tailored to various application contexts. Initially, two scenarios are analyzed: one constrained by bandwidth with unlimited storage, and the other by storage with unlimited bandwidth. For each scenario, optimal solutions are developed using a novel enhanced graph construction method. The study progresses to a more intricate scenario involving comprehensive constraints on storage, computation, and communication resources. An optimized deployment method is proposed, utilizing main path embedding followed by an innovative simulated annealing algorithm for iterative refinement. This method is validated by demonstrating that the main path coincides with the critical path. Furthermore, the dynamic reallocation of edge resources is explored through a critical path-based updating algorithm that optimizes microservice locations to reduce overall makespan. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our strategies outperform existing representative benchmark approaches in terms of overall performance and microservice deployment efficiency."

To enable reliable detection at legitimate receivers, we design both optimal and low-complexity receiver architectures, and further introduce a clipping-based technique to suppress phase wrapping and enhance demodulation robustness. Additionally, the average bit error probability (ABEP) is analytically characterized through performance analysis. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CE-OFDM-IM system achieves robust transmission with zero peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), offering a practical and energy-efficient solution for secure communications in SAGIN environments."

To explore its applicability in realistic industrial conditions, we focused on constrained acquisition scenarios—characterized by low sampling rates, limited storage, and processing capacity. A multimodal dataset was collected using embedded tri-axial accelerometers and barometric pressure sensors during operational tasks. Four classification pipelines were evaluated: Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), a wavelet-based RF (using Horizontal Concatenation of Continuous Wavelet Transforms, HC-CWT), and a deep learning pipeline combining a Convolutional Autoencoder with LSTM (ConvAE-LSTM). Among these, XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy (up to 87.4%) and the most favorable balance between latency and computational efficiency, particularly with 8–15 s windows. This best-performing model was then deployed on the resource-constrained helmet system, confirming its suitability for on-board HAR in scalable occupational safety applications."

However, current methods are still far from practical usage. First, prior works focus narrowly on specific sub-tasks or settings, which do not align with diverse real-world applications. Second, their performance is sub-optimal due to limitations in dataset coverage, scale, and quality. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Enhanced Descriptive image Quality Assessment (EDQA). Our method includes a multi-functional IQA task paradigm that encompasses both assessment and comparison tasks, brief and detailed responses, full-reference and non-reference scenarios. We introduce a ground-truth-informed dataset construction approach to enhance data quality, and scale up the dataset to 495K under the brief-detail joint framework. Consequently, we construct a comprehensive, large-scale, and high-quality dataset, named EDQA-495K. We also retain image resolution during training to better handle resolution-related quality issues, and estimate a confidence score that is helpful to filter out low-quality responses. Experimental results demonstrate that EDQA significantly outperforms traditional score-based methods, prior VLM-based IQA models, and proprietary GPT-4V in distortion identification, instant rating, and reasoning tasks. Our advantages are further confirmed by real-world applications including assessing the web-downloaded images and ranking model-processed images. Datasets and codes will be released."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design of a low-cost, reliable, portable communication interface to monitor the functionality of a Battery Management System (BMS) without the aid of an inverter. Modbus communication protocol is examined and implemented to handle real-time data sharing, system monitoring, and fault detection. The system is tested through practical implementation to assess how reliably and accurately it could transmit the essential battery data. The results demonstrate the correct functionality when measured metrics are compared between an installed inverter and the proposed system. The designed interface shows reliable performance in tracking critical parameters including voltage (±0.5% accuracy), current (±1% accuracy), temperature (±1°C precision), and state of charge (±3% error). This work opens future perspectives towards the integration of artificial intelligence methods on the portable system for metrics estimation and analysis."

    "abstract": "Robotic systems often encounter difficulties in distinguishing between instances of the same category when instructed via natural language, particularly under attribute-based constraints such as size, color, or spatial position. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates open-vocabulary instance segmentation with language-driven reasoning to accurately identify the object referenced by attribute-rich user instructions—for example, “the largest red box” or “the second cup from the left”. Our method first generates multiple candidate object masks from a static RGB image and assigns each instance a unique visual label. These labeled instances, together with the language command, are then processed by a large vision-language model to resolve the correct target. Unlike prior approaches, our framework does not require explicit pretraining for visual-language alignment and demonstrates strong generalization to unseen attribute combinations. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through robotic grasping experiments, which confirm its robustness in cluttered scenes containing multiple visually similar objects."

This contribution presents a simulation-based methodology that employs simplified thermal equivalent models (Cauer networks) to evaluate the criticality of short-circuit component failures by modeling the internal thermal failure behavior of components, while simultaneously assessing the resulting impact on voltage levels over time. By distinguishing harmless from critical faults, the approach enables more realistic estimations of the failure probability (Failure In Time rate), avoiding unnecessarily conservative safety margins and improving reliability assessments. The simulation results indicate that short-circuit faults in EMI filters, DC-link capacitors, and MOSFETs are largely non-critical for vehicle power electronics. By identifying EMI filters and DC-link capacitors as safe faults, the estimated failure rate can be reduced by up to 90%."

    "abstract": "Time-To-Digital Converters (TDCs) are crucial for high-precision time measurements in applications like particle physics and medical imaging. While ASIC-based TDCs offer high accuracy, they lack flexibility. Implementing TDC on FPGA platforms faces significant challenges due to the digital nature of these devices. In literature, TDC designs are often presented in theoretical terms, with limited implementation details. Practical realizations frequently require adapting and refining the original concepts to match the specific device architecture and capability. The custom placement and routing constraints, or manual instantiation of primitive elements, are rarely discussed but are critical for achieving reliable and reproducible results. The omission of these aspects contributes to the gap between theoretical proposals and working hardware implementations. This work addresses this gap by presenting a fully implemented and FPGA-optimized TDC based on a tapped delay line (TDL) architecture, achieving 6 ps resolution and 30 ps precision on an AMD Kintex UltraScale FPGA, discussing detailed low-level optimizations, making it not only a high-performance solution but also a concrete reference for future implementations."

This paper introduces an autonomous robotic system for pressure ulcer care that operates through a novel hierarchical Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture.

The system integrates an RGB-D camera for spatial perception, Qwen3 language model for instruction interpretation, and a ROS-controlled DENSO Cobotta robotic arm for precise interventions. Through in-context learning techniques, our approach effectively overcomes domain knowledge limitations in both vision and language components. Laboratory experiments with medical mannequins demonstrate the system achieves an 87.51% success rate across diverse tasks, including joint movement, object manipulation, and simulated wound irrigation. Comparative analysis reveals clear performance improvements through in-context learning, with success rates increasing from near-zero to over 85% for complex tasks. As the first implementation of a VLA-driven robotic system for wound care, this research addresses the critical gap between surgical robotics and nursing assistance, potentially enhancing treatment consistency while reducing healthcare worker workload in clinical settings."

In this paper, we measure the performance effect of weather forecast incorporation into the input pipeline of a data-based outage SoR prediction model. Results indicate that the SoR prediction performance of the model using forecasts is better than the baseline model without any forecast and is comparable to using actual weather parameters from the prediction window.

    "abstract": "With the growing adoption of 5G technology, the proliferation of low-power sensors for the Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to increase considerably. As the number of IoT sensors grows, maintaining their batteries becomes increasingly challenging. To overcome this challenge, researchers are exploring energy harvesting solutions to self-power IoT sensors. In 5G networks, the high density of antennas ensures that a nearby antenna is available to provide sufficient RF energy for powering sensors. However, extracting energy efficiently from available high-frequency RF sources is a challenging task. The efficiency of conventional RF-to-DC converters drops significantly as the frequency increases and the input power decreases. This work presents a novel approach that maintains high efficiency even at low RF input power levels where conventional methods fail. In the proposed solution, a passive transmission-line network is utilized to boost the voltage induced by an incoming RF signal. This approach not only improves efficiency but also enables energy extraction from weak incoming signals that cannot be harvested otherwise. Simulation results indicate that an efficiency of 78% can be achieved at 5.2 GHz with an input signal power as low as −20 dBm."

    "abstract": "As Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) continue to grow in complexity and accuracy, their deployment on embedded platforms requires hardware-aware optimizations to meet stringent constraints on logic resources, power, and latency. FPGAs offer an attractive solution because of their parallelism, reconfigurability, and energy efficiency. However, conventional FPGA design flows remain time-consuming and often lack early-stage estimation capabilities. This work introduces a library of parameterizable Intellectual Properties (IPs) for convolution, activation, and pooling, developed in VHDL and optimized for fixed-point arithmetic. IPs were designed to address various architectural trade-offs involving logic usage, DSP allocation strategy, parallelism, and power efficiency, while also supporting faster development through modular reuse. To accelerate design space exploration, a methodology is proposed for generating predictive mathematical models capable of estimating key FPGA resource metrics as functions of input bit widths. The models were validated with low prediction errors and coefficient of determination (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) values greater than 0.94, allowing accurate estimation of the resources and dynamic power without synthesis. This supports fast architectural decisions and paves the way for automated, resource-aware CNN deployment on FPGAs."

    "abstract": "Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) typically rely on a fully connected or dense layer for final decision-making, where each neuron connects to all neurons in the previous layer. The softmax function converts these outputs into a probability distribution over the target classes. While effective, this approach may limit the network ability to capture complex image details across multiple levels of abstraction. Shallow architectures may suffice for simple problems, whereas deeper networks are often required for more complicated tasks. A straightforward solution to improve classification is constructing multiple CNN branch models and using a naïve ensemble method that combines their outputs equally. However, this approach can underperform when weaker models improperly influence the final prediction. Unlike greedy ensemble growing that exhaustively evaluates all candidate models to identify the optimal subset, in this paper we propose an iterative ensemble threshold selection technique that progressively selects optimal thresholds to integrate only high-confidence predictions. By leveraging diverse CNN structures, our method captures features at varying complexities, improves classification robustness, and reduces computational overhead. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach matches the accuracy of greedy ensemble methods while requiring significantly fewer evaluations, outperforming conventional CNN architectures."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of robot technologies, robot-assisted tele-homecare systems enter human living environments to provide homecare services. In such a context, physical human-robot contact becomes inevitable. Ensuring safety during human-robot interaction in home environments becomes a critical challenge. However, conventional methods mainly rely on creating a collision-free environment, which is insufficient for inevitable or even desirable human-robot contact. This article proposes a proactive safety architecture that smoothly switches between collision avoidance and contact reaction. To enable proactive sensing for homecare robots, a proximity sensor is customized with the abilities of approach and contact awareness. Based on the proximity sensing data, a proactive safety architecture is proposed to ensure continuous task execution while avoiding potential collisions. For inevitable contact, a pretouch and contact reaction strategy is designed to enable a seamless transition from proximity-sensing-based collision avoidance to contact reaction. Comparative experiments are conducted to validate the proactive safety architecture on a telerobotic system prototype. Compared with the three state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed strategy reduces contact force (by at least 35.21% along the primary collision direction) while maximizing motion-tracking performance. A user study is conducted to investigate the user experience. Feedback from 10 participants highlights positive evaluations of this system’s usability, indicating the feasibility of the proposed strategy in enhancing safety during human-robot interaction for the tele-homecare system."

The plasma is expected to exhibit complex O–X–B mode conversion when O and X-modes are launched from the LFS at different angles to the toroidal magnetic field. Experiments on mode conversion are conducted by varying the toroidal launch angle up to 10°. The Budden parameter for the experimental conditions is estimated to understand the tunneling effects through the evanescent layer. The verification of the O–X mode conversion has also been done using a full-wave simulation, as the WKB approximation is not applicable here. Experiments further suggest that the launching of the X-mode from the outboard side introduces large fluctuations and may be responsible for destabilizing the entire plasma production process."

Although Transformer-based methods have achieved significant advancements in this field, their standard global attention mechanism allows pixels to pay equal attention to all spatial positions, which lacks explicit prior knowledge of spatial proximity correlation, making the model unable to strengthen local associations and weaken long-distance connections. Furthermore, most existing methods rely on global average pooling when reinforcing channel-wise representations, which often dilutes the features of key changed regions by the largely unchanged background, resulting in the inability of feature compression to focus on the critical positions. To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper proposes a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Dynamic Gaussian Attenuate Transformer</i> (DGAT), which innovatively introduces a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Dynamic Gaussian Attenuation</i> (DGA) mechanism to model an attenuation law between visual tokens from two perspectives based on Euclidean distance. At the spatial level, DGA constrains visual attention through distance-related Gaussian attenuation, allowing it to prioritize attention on adjacent regions, thereby enhancing the detection of changes in local continuity; at the channel level, DGA identifies the core area based on the visual attention kernel, and uses the joint optimization of dynamic Gaussian weighted pooling and channel modulation to focus on features at key positions, effectively enhancing the expression of important channels. Experimental results on three benchmark RSICC datasets demonstrate that our proposed DGAT achieves significantly superior results, verifying the effectiveness of the DGA mechanism.

    "abstract": "The reconstruction of monocular endoscope video scenes is essential for enhancing the application and analysis of surgical endoscopic images. However, restricted by the narrow space of endoscopic movement and the obstruction of vision within cavities, it is difficult for most conventional methods to perform high-quality reconstruction. To address these challenges, a novel dynamic growing 3D gaussian splatting architecture is proposed to construct the 3D model of endoscopic scene without precomputed camera poses or Structure from Motion. Firstly, to establish spatial feature associations between interframes, a 2D-3D displacement fields are designed by utilizing dense feature matches and depth prediction. On this basis, a novel displacement field variational optimization is developed to obtain relative poses by minimizing the energy functional associated with field transformation. Secondly, to address the constraint of the endoscopic view, by gaussian sequential transformation and differential gradient field optimization, a novel Sequential Gaussian Growing Module is proposed to grow the local gaussian model sequentially. Finally, a novel Forward-Reconstruction&Backward-Optimization architecture is proposed to generate the global gaussian model. The evaluation is conducted on two public endoscopic datasets: Scared and C3VD. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, ATE, RMSE, MAE) and qualitative comparisons.

However, existing blockchain-enhanced FL (BFL) approaches remain vulnerable to malicious participants and lack robust protection for model updates. To address these issues, we propose SEPP-FLBC, a Secure and Efficient Privacy Protection framework based on Federated Learning and Blockchain Committees. SEPP-FLBC introduces a novel blockchain committee consensus mechanism to validate model updates and defend against unreliable nodes. It further employs a refined multi-party communication paradigm to facilitate indirect and secure data interactions, reducing the risk of information leakage. Additionally, differential privacy noise is applied to model updates to enhance resistance to inference attacks. A formal convergence analysis is conducted to ensure model stability and minimize overhead. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEPP-FLBC achieves superior accuracy while maintaining strong privacy guarantees and communication efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art BFL methods in both security and performance."

    "abstract": "Drawing on the conservation of resources (COR) theory and the cognitive-affective process system (CAPS) framework, this study investigates how relational governance boosts project team resilience through a dual-path mediation mechanism. Employing hierarchical multiple regression and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, empirical results reveal that team reflexivity and team affective identification fully mediate the relationship between relational governance and project team resilience, with a significant serial mediation effect flowing sequentially from team reflexivity to team affective identification. Furthermore, project complexity emerges as a boundary condition, enhancing the mediating role of team reflexivity while exerting no significant moderating effect on the affective identification pathway. A series of additional robustness checks was conducted for each method within the mixed-methods design, further reinforcing the overall rigor and reliability of the results. These findings advance the theoretical understanding of how resilience develops, unfolds, and is shaped in project teams, affording novel insights to the body of knowledge in engineering project management. In terms of practical application, this study highlights the need for project managers to prioritize relational governance strategies to foster project team resilience through cultivating reflective practices and shared affective bonds, while calibrating these strategies according to the contextual complexities of project-based engineering environments."

Then, we analyse two scenarios: First, the primary source adapts the modulation scheme based on the channel conditions of the primary signal to meet the target bit error rate (BER), evaluating metrics: mode selection probability, outage mode probability (OMP), BER, and spectral efficiency. Second, the primary source adapts its transmission rate and/or power according to three channel policies: constant power with optimal rate adaptation, optimal simultaneous power and rate adaptation, and truncated channel inversion with a fixed rate. Results show that for the first scenario, our proposed approach significantly improves the OMP and BER of the adaptive symbiotic system in the moderate and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes compared to the fixed one, while the second scenario shows a promising choice for balancing capacity between backscatter and cellular rates in the low SNR regime."

The CCAA offers significant reduction of Radar Cross Section (RCS) but suffers from coupling that limits radiation performance. To address this, open rectangular resonant slots (ORRS) are employed to suppress induced wall currents and restore bandwidth, patterns, and gain. A 4×4 prototype was designed, fabricated, and tested. Both simulation and measurement confirm a 10-dB impedance bandwidth of 43.5% (7.9-12.3 GHz) with radiation comparable to a planar array (PAA). In addition, relative to the PAA, the decoupled CCAA achieves 10-dB RCS reduction bandwidths of 35% and 15% under X- and Co-pol. incidences. These results verify that the ORRS-based decoupling design enables the CCAA to simultaneously realize broadband radiation and low observability."

    "abstract": "The increasing adoption of advanced three-dimensional (3D) scanning technologies has made large-scale point clouds containing millions of 3D measurement points standard in applications like manufacturing. However, processing immense amounts of 3D data imposes significant computational loads, often resulting in discarded critical information and suboptimal outcomes for downstream tasks. This paper introduces Point-ITR, a task-oriented sampling method tailored for regression tasks, which selectively retains the most informative points within large-scale point clouds. Specifically, we propose a gradient-based importance sampling framework for intra-sample selection (selecting points within a 3D point cloud) and a feature-based weighting scheme for inter-sample selection (selecting among different 3D point cloud sub-samples). Additionally, we introduce an iterative random sampling (ItrRS) module for preprocessing and an Offset Residual Block that utilizes a reference design model to learn structural features and accelerate both training and testing, which allows a simple fully connected network to process large-scale point clouds. Our approach improves prediction accuracy across downstream tasks while ensuring that the rich details captured are fully utilized for interpretation, offering a more effective and efficient solution. We validate our methodology through simulation studies and real-world case applications in additive manufacturing, demonstrating its robustness and practical applicability."

We categorize constraints as conservative or aggressive and provide insights into their search behavior, focusing specifically on vanilla Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and Conflict-Based Search with Priorities (CBSw/P). Under a hybrid grid-roadmap representation with varying resolution, we observe that aggressive (priority constraint) formulations tend to solve more instances as agent count or resolution increases, whereas conservative (motion constraint) formulations yield stronger solution quality when both succeed. Findings are synthesized in a decision flowchart, aiding users in selecting suitable constraints. Recommendations extend to Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP), emphasizing the importance of considering topological features alongside problem, solution, and representation features. A comprehensive exploration of the study, including raw data and map performance, is available in our public GitHub Repository."

    "abstract": "Autonomous exploration of unknown 3D environments requires motion planners that can efficiently identify informative regions to explore while continuously adapting to the evolving map of the environment. While existing sampling-based methods have demonstrated strong real-time performance, they often ignore the robot's kinodynamic model and constraints. Consequently, they generate only target positions, neglecting kinodynamic considerations in the next-best-view decision process. This results in frequent slowdowns and abrupt maneuvers, reducing coverage speed and exploration efficiency. In this work, we propose a kinodynamic motion planning framework designed for fast and efficient exploration of unknown environments. By incorporating the robot's kinodynamic model and constraints into a kinodynamic RRT, our approach bridges the gap between dynamically feasible motion and effective viewpoint selection, producing smoother and faster trajectories that improve exploration performance. Additionally, we present an Iterative Minimum Gain (IMG) approach to improve global coverage, and a novel informed yaw optimization method that accelerates optimal yaw selection, capable of achieving up to more than twice the speed of state-of-the-art methods. We validate our framework through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating improved exploration rates, higher average velocities, and better global coverage over existing methods."

Specifically, the new topology combines an isolated resonant LLC converter and two bi-directional buck-boost converters by using only four MOSFETs on the primary side, and thus, fulfills PV voltage regulation and battery management in a low-cost manner. Then, by properly designing the control sequence for the power switches, the system can not only divide the PVs into two groups for distributed management, but also stack the PVs and the battery as the DC supply for LLC. This reduces the influence of PV voltage variation and eliminates the need of pre-regulation stage. In addition, the LLC part can either maintain a symmetrical mode to improve efficiency, or add asymmetry control when a wider regulation range is needed. Based on the theoretical analysis, experimental results verify the performance of the proposed concept."

    "abstract": "To address the “data silo” challenge in traffic flow data acquisition, this paper proposes a method for estimating urban road segment traffic flow from sparse vehicle trajectory data, predicated on the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD). Initially, the conventional MFD model is extended to represent a single, signalized road segment. This extension incorporates a lane-changing behavior model to quantify the impact of lane-level flow redistribution on the segment’s traffic capacity. Subsequently, an analytical relationship between signal control strategies and flow fluctuations is established, enabling the refinement of segment flow estimations based on phase cycle characteristics. Finally, an iterative parameter calibration algorithm, leveraging sparse trajectory data, is designed to facilitate the adaptive updating of model parameters, thereby reducing the reliance on large-scale labeled datasets. Validation conducted using a floating car dataset from Xuancheng City demonstrates the model’s superior performance on road segments with medium-flow (MAE = 67.97 pcu/h) and high-flow (MAE = 41.28 pcu/h) conditions. It achieves an error reduction of over 30% compared to baseline models that neglect lane-changing behavior and signal control. This research provides a highly interpretable solution for real-time traffic flow estimation under “data silo” constraints, offering critical support for dynamic urban traffic management and planning."

    "abstract": "High-voltage cables and accessories are the key components of power transmission, and the insulation interface is the weakest part of the insulation system. In order to study the effect of interface defects on the interface discharge characteristics of cables and accessories, firstly, the cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE), silicone rubber (SIR) and semi-conductive (SEMI) samples are prepared, and the composite samples are fabricated (including XLPE/SIR and XLPE/SEMI composite samples). Secondly, the effects of interface defects on the breakdown, dielectric and interface discharge properties of composite samples are analyzed. Finally, the composite interface defect model of cable and accessories is established to calculate the electric field distortion caused by the defect. The results show that the breakdown strength and interface discharge voltage of XLPE/SIR interface with voids and semi-conductive defects are 36.7, 39.98 kV/mm and 12.07, 10.95 kV, respectively. The relative dielectric constant of the samples with defects increased significantly comparing with the samples without defects. The breakdown strength of XLPE/SEMI interface with void, metal and semi-conductive defect are 65.00, 72.79 and 75.23 kV/mm, respectively, and the existence of defect leads to the overall increase of relative dielectric constant. The simulation results show that the maximum electric field distortion caused by voids and semi-conductive defects in XLPE/SIR interface are 19.28 and 10.78 kV/mm, respectively, increasing by 155.70% and 42.97%. The maximum electric field distortion caused by voids, metal and semi-conductivity defects in the XLPE/SEMI interface are 19.09, 8.62 and 8.40 kV/mm, respectively, increasing by 186.21%, 29.24% and 25.94%. The simulation results of electric field distortion are consistent with the breakdown test. This study is helpful to understand the effect of interface defects of cable accessories on electric field distribution, and it can provide reference for the operation, maintenance and fault analysis of cable accessories."

    "abstract": "There remains a gap in the study of evolutionary music without interactive evolution and goal-based fitness functions for evolutionary music, and in particular for classical tabla music. This paper studies the potential of generating classical tabla compositions using evolutionary algorithms. Unlike traditional methods, this study eliminates interactive evolution and goal-based fitness functions, creating a fully automated process. Music quality and creativity are driven by two factors: the userprovided “good pairs,” and tempo. The algorithm optimizes for placement of good pairs and the total difference between the bols of the taal. Further analysis highlights the importance of key parameters and selection schemes in achieving optimal fitness values.

    "abstract": "Optimizing energy efficiency in dual-core microcontroller systems requires careful consideration of processing resource allocation and operational states. This study analyzes the energy consumption characteristics of the Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040 microcontroller while utilizing both Cortex-M0+ cores for Internet of Things (IoT) workloads that consider an audio related case study with audio acquisition, digital signal processing, and wireless transmission. The experimental measurements compare single-core and dual-core operation while the microcontroller is operating in multiple voltage-frequency configurations and temperature conditions. The evaluation considers bare-metal implementation. The results characterize performance-energy trade-offs related to parallel task execution and establish quantitative relationships between processing configurations and energy consumption. The findings of this work contribute to the systematic design of energy-efficient embedded systems for sensor networks."

    "abstract": "The open-source large models (LLMs) developed by DeepSeek have demonstrated substantial utility in various applications. However, such LLMs inference services usually require users to upload their private data to backend servers for computation, giving rise to severe risks of data security leakage. Cryptographic techniques such as secure multi-party computation (MPC) and homomorphic encryption provide feasible solutions to the above problems. However, the existing schemes do not securely and efficiently support Grouped Query Attention (GQA) mechanism, SiLU activation layer, etc., thus making it difficult to achieve secure and efficient inference for DeepSeek models. Therefore, we propose PrivSeek, a lightweight and private inference for distilled DeepSeek-Qwen via secret sharing. Firstly, we construct a secure and efficient improved causal self-attention mask mechanism based on secret sharing, and adopt a two-stage calculation method of lower triangle mask and dynamic row normalization to overcome the limitations of arithmetic logic in ciphertext environment while ensuring controllable complexity. Secondly, we construct a secure and efficient SiLU protocol by combining the look-up table(LUT) mechanism and blinding technology, which effectively reduces the nonlinear computational complexity and realizes the lightweight design of secure computing protocol. Experimental results show that PrivSeek achieves 22.52 seconds per token with only $1.2 \\%$ deviation from the maximum accuracy of plaintext benchmarks on mainstream datasets."

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated an increased interest in surface electromyogram (sEMG) signal-based applications. It has been established that the efficiency of these applications may be subject to decline because of the presence of various sMG signals' contaminants originating from diverse sources. Power line interference (PLI) is one of the most encountered artifacts in the recording of sEMG signals. The present study aims to characterize and suppress PLI on the sEMG signal. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are proposed to automatically identify the artifactual epochs using PLI. The selected epochs as contaminated are processed through a denoising block in which they are decomposed into components using independent component analysis (ICA). Thereafter, based on the kurtosis, the artifactual components are selected to be denoised and preserve the artifact-free epochs. Finally, the denoised signal is reconstructed using filtered and untouched epochs and components. Using different assessments, the proposed method is evaluated and compared with some of the most used approaches in the literature. The results return the best performance of our method at all considered signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)."
