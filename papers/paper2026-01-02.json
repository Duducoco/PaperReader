    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal optical vortices carry transverse orbital angular momentum (t-OAM), which give rise to spatiotemporal topological charge (ST-TC). To unleash the full potential of t-OAM in expanding the capacity of communication and computing, we demonstrate the first optical information-processing pipeline capable of performing addition and subtraction on ST-TC values, regardless of whether they are integer or fractional. Additionally, we established a readout method for those mathematical operations through imaging spectral analysis, providing a robust optical basis toward arithmetic operations and verification. These new capabilities mark crucial advancements toward full arithmetic operations on the ST-TC of light for bosonic state computation and information processing."

    "abstract": "An $α$-thin tree $T$ of a graph $G$ is a spanning tree such that every cut of $G$ has at most an $α$ proportion of its edges in $T$. The Thin Tree Conjecture proposes that there exists a function $f$ such that for any $α> 0$, every $f(α)$-edge-connected graph has an $α$-thin tree. Aside from its independent interest, an algorithm which could efficiently construct an $O(1)/k$-thin tree for a given $k$-edge-connected graph would directly lead to an $O(1)$-approximation algorithm for the asymmetric travelling salesman problem (ATSP)(arXiv:0909.2849). However, it was not even known whether it is possible to efficiently verify that a given tree is $α$-thin. We prove that determining the thinness of a tree is coNP-hard."

Traditional regulatory technology solutions designed for centralized financial systems prove inadequate for blockchain's transparent yet pseudonymous networks. This systematization examines how blockchain-native RegTech solutions leverage distributed ledger properties to enable novel compliance capabilities. We develop three taxonomies organizing the Web3 RegTech domain: a regulatory paradigm evolution framework across ten dimensions, a compliance protocol taxonomy encompassing five verification layers, and a RegTech lifecycle framework spanning preventive, real-time, and investigative phases. Through analysis of 41 operational commercial platforms and 28 academic prototypes selected from systematic literature review (2015-2025), we demonstrate that Web3 RegTech enables transaction graph analysis, real-time risk assessment, cross-chain analytics, and privacy-preserving verification approaches that are difficult to achieve or less commonly deployed in traditional centralized systems. Our analysis reveals critical gaps between academic innovation and industry deployment, alongside persistent challenges in cross-chain tracking, DeFi interaction analysis, privacy protocol monitoring, and scalability. We synthesize architectural best practices and identify research directions addressing these gaps while respecting Web3's core principles of decentralization, transparency, and user sovereignty."

The original formulation does not specify what 3-critical means, and two non-equivalent notions have appeared in the literature and in later discussions of the problem. In this paper we resolve the question under both interpretations. For the transversal interpretation (criticality with respect to the transversal number), we prove that a 3-uniform hypergraph $H$ with $τ(H)=3$ and $τ(H-e)=2$ for every edge $e$ has at most 10 edges; in particular, $δ(H)\\le 6$, and this bound is sharp, witnessed by the complete 3-graph $K^{(3)}_5$. For the chromatic interpretation (criticality with respect to weak vertex-colourings), we give an explicit 3-uniform hypergraph on 9 vertices with $χ(H)=3$ and minimum degree $δ(H)=7$ such that deleting any single edge or any single vertex makes it 2-colourable. The criticality of the example is certified by explicit witness 2-colourings listed in the appendices, together with a short verification script."

    "abstract": "Sampling tasks have been successful in establishing quantum advantages both in theory and experiments. This has fueled the use of quantum computers for generative modeling to create samples following the probability distribution underlying a given dataset. In particular, the potential to build generative models on classically hard distributions would immediately preclude classical simulability, due to theoretical separations. In this work, we study quantum generative models from the perspective of output distributions, showing that models that anticoncentrate are not trainable on average, including those exhibiting quantum advantage. In contrast, models outputting data from sparse distributions can be trained. We consider special cases to enhance trainability, and observe that this opens the path for classical algorithms for surrogate sampling. This observed trade-off is linked to verification of quantum processes. We conclude that quantum advantage can still be found in generative models, although its source must be distinct from anticoncentration."

Automating parts of this process is therefore both scientifically significant and operationally necessary to ensure fair allocation and reproducible decisions at scale. We present AstroReview, an open-source, agent-based framework that automates proposal review in three stages: (i) novelty and scientific merit, (ii) feasibility and expected yield, and (iii) meta-review and reliability verification. Task isolation and explicit reasoning traces curb hallucinations and improve transparency. Without any domain specific fine tuning, AstroReview used in our experiments only for the last stage, correctly identifies genuinely accepted proposals with an accuracy of 87%. The AstroReview in Action module replicates the review and refinement loop; with its integrated Proposal Authoring Agent, the acceptance rate of revised drafts increases by 66% after two iterations, showing that iterative feedback combined with automated meta-review and reliability verification delivers measurable quality gains. Together, these results point to a practical path toward scalable, auditable, and higher throughput proposal review for resource limited facilities."

The model adopts a three-level role division architecture consisting of generation, verification, and integration. An opinion generation agent produces diverse reasoning perspectives, an evidence verification agent retrieves external knowledge and quantifies factual support, and a consistency arbitration agent integrates logically coherent conclusions. A self-game mechanism is introduced to expand multi-path reasoning trajectories, while a retrieval enhancement module dynamically supplements external knowledge. A composite reward function combining factual consistency and logical coherence is designed, and an improved proximal policy optimization strategy is applied for collaborative training. Experimental results show that the proposed model improves multi-hop reasoning accuracy by 16.8 percent on HotpotQA, 14.3 percent on 2WikiMultihopQA, and 19.2 percent on MeetingBank, while improving consistency by 21.5 percent. The model achieves higher reasoning efficiency than mainstream multi-agent approaches, providing an effective and stable solution for complex reasoning tasks."

    "abstract": "Fully automated verification of large-scale software and hardware systems is arguably the holy grail of formal methods. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated their potential for enhancing the degree of automation in formal verification by, e.g., generating formal specifications as essential to deductive verification, yet exhibit poor scalability due to long-context reasoning limitations and, more importantly, the difficulty of inferring complex, interprocedural specifications. This paper presents Preguss -- a modular, fine-grained framework for automating the generation and refinement of formal specifications. Preguss synergizes between static analysis and deductive verification by steering two components in a divide-and-conquer fashion: (i) potential runtime error-guided construction and prioritization of verification units, and (ii) LLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications at the unit level. We show that Preguss substantially outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches and, in particular, it enables highly automated RTE-freeness verification for real-world programs with over a thousand LoC, with a reduction of 80.6%~88.9% human verification effort."

For any $n\\ge5$, an $n$-ary threshold word is a word $w$ such that for any factor (subword) $v$ of $w$ the condition $\\frac{|v|}{per(v)}\\le\\frac{n}{n-1}$ holds. Dejean conjecture (completely proven in 2009) states for $n\\ge5$ that exists infinitely many of $n$-ary TWs. This manuscript is based on the author's student works (diplomas of 2011 (bachelor's thesis) and 2013 (master's thesis) years) and presents an edited version (in Russian) of these works with some improvements. In a 2011 work proposed new methods of proving of the Dejean conjecture for some odd cases $n\\ge5$, using computer verification in polynomial time (depending on $n$). Moreover, the constructed threshold words (TWs) are ciclic/ring TWs (any cyclic shift is a TW). In the 2013 work, the proof method (of 2011) was improved by reducing the verification conditions. A solution for some even cases $n\\ge6$ is also proposed. A 2013 work also proposed a method to construct stronger TWs, using a TW tree with regular exponential growth.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to solve complex tasks. While effective, these trajectories are frequently inefficient, leading to high latency from excessive token generation, or unstable reasoning that alternates between underthinking (shallow, inconsistent steps) and overthinking (repetitive, verbose reasoning). In this work, we study the structure of reasoning trajectories and uncover specialized attention heads that correlate with distinct cognitive behaviors such as verification and backtracking. By lightly intervening on these heads at inference time, we can steer the model away from inefficient modes. Building on this insight, we propose CREST, a training-free method for Cognitive REasoning Steering at Test-time. CREST has two components: (1) an offline calibration step that identifies cognitive heads and derives head-specific steering vectors, and (2) an inference-time procedure that rotates hidden representations to suppress components along those vectors. CREST adaptively suppresses unproductive reasoning behaviors, yielding both higher accuracy and lower computational cost. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and models, CREST improves accuracy by up to 17.5% while reducing token usage by 37.6%, offering a simple and effective pathway to faster, more reliable LLM reasoning."

Our architecture maintains a node-based search state together with a reusable global lemma store and a proof log. Learning occurs in two layers: (i) \\emph{linear lemmas} (cuts) whose validity is justified by checkable certificates, and (ii) \\emph{Boolean conflict clauses} extracted from infeasible guarded cores, enabling DPLL(T)-style pruning across nodes. We present an end-to-end algorithm (ICL-Verifier) and a companion hybrid pipeline (HSRV) combining relaxation pruning, exact checks, and branch-and-bound splitting. We prove soundness, and we state a conditional completeness result under exhaustive splitting for compact domains and PWL operators. Finally, we outline an experimental protocol against standardized benchmarks (VNN-LIB / VNN-COMP) to evaluate pruning effectiveness, learned-lemma reuse, and exact-gate efficiency."

Beyond a Boolean grid-based baseline that marks cells as in- or outside, we explore a distance-aware encoding approach that stores how far each cell is from a zone boundary and uses interpolation to reason within a cell. Our experiments on real-world data demonstrate that the proposed distance-aware approach achieves higher accuracy on coarse grids (max. 60%p accuracy gain) with only a moderate verification overhead (approximately 1.4x), making zone encoding the key lever for efficient zero-knowledge spatial checks."

    "abstract": "We investigate how black hole images (shadows and accretion-disk images) encode thermodynamic evolution information across different ensembles, using the Reissner-Nordström-AdS black hole as an illustrative example. Through analytic treatment and numerical verification, we demonstrate that these images encode not only phase transition information but also ensemble information, including additional temperature information in the isothermal ensemble. Phase transition information appears as a sudden increase in image size, which we prove occurs in both isobaric and isothermal ensembles. The ensemble and temperature information originates from a fundamental difference between isobaric and isothermal evolution: image size varies monotonically with the horizon radius along isobars, whereas it exhibits nonmonotonic behavior along isotherms. This contrast serves as a diagnostic tool to distinguish isobaric from isothermal evolution. In the isothermal ensemble, the nonmonotonic behavior introduces an extremal radius whose relative ordering with the small- and large-black hole radii at the phase transition admits three logical possibilities. Our analysis reveals that only two of these possibilities are physically realized, separated by a critical reduced temperature. Furthermore, image evolution in the two resulting temperature intervals exhibits qualitatively differences, demonstrating that black hole images indeed encode temperature information. These results not only enrich the set of observational avenues for probing black hole thermodynamic properties, but also introduce a new paradigm. This paradigm studies phase transitions in conjunction with nonmonotonic evolution, providing a useful framework for exploring thermodynamic imprints in other black hole systems."

Most recent methods treat text-guided segmentation as one-shot grounding, where the model predicts pixel prompts in a single forward pass to drive an external segmentor, which limits verification, refocusing and refinement when initial localization is wrong. To address this limitation, we propose RSAgent, an agentic Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) which interleaves reasoning and action for segmentation via multi-turn tool invocations. RSAgent queries a segmentation toolbox, observes visual feedback, and revises its spatial hypothesis using historical observations to re-localize targets and iteratively refine masks. We further build a data pipeline to synthesize multi-turn reasoning segmentation trajectories, and train RSAgent with a two-stage framework: cold-start supervised fine-tuning followed by agentic reinforcement learning with fine-grained, task-specific rewards. Extensive experiments show that RSAgent achieves a zero-shot performance of 66.5% gIoU on ReasonSeg test, improving over Seg-Zero-7B by 9%, and reaches 81.5% cIoU on RefCOCOg, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks."

Static benchmarks like MMLU and TruthfulQA cannot distinguish a model that lacks knowledge from one whose verification mechanisms collapse when information degrades or adversaries probe for weaknesses. We introduce the Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT), a protocol that measures epistemic robustness: a model's ability to maintain factual accuracy under progressive semantic compression and adversarial fabrication. We propose a two-system cognitive model comprising a Semantic System that generates fluent text and an Epistemic Verifier that validates factual accuracy. Our findings, based on evaluating 9 frontier models across 8 knowledge domains at 5 compression levels (1,800 turn-level evaluations), reveal that epistemic robustness is orthogonal to conventional design paradigms. Neither parameter count (r=0.083, p=0.832) nor architectural type (r=0.153, p=0.695) significantly predicts robustness, suggesting it emerges from training methodology and verification mechanisms distinct from current approaches. Error detection capability strongly predicts overall robustness (rho=-0.817, p=0.007), indicating this is the critical bottleneck. We find that flagship models exhibit brittleness despite their scale, while smaller models can achieve robust performance, challenging assumptions about the relationship between model size and reliability. The DDFT framework provides both theoretical foundation and practical tools for assessing epistemic robustness before deployment in critical applications."

    "abstract": "This work presents the design and training of a large language model (LLM) for bidirectional translation between Spanish and Nahuatl, focusing on technical accuracy and cultural relevance. A bilingual corpus of 7,500 sentence pairs was constructed, a Transformer model was trained from scratch with Sentence-Piece tokenization, and a functional web prototype was deployed. BLEU and chrF++ metrics confirm the viability of the system, which preserves linguistic features of Nahuatl frequently omitted by generic translators. The model has immediate applications in educational and community contexts and represents a technical and social contribution toward digital inclusion and the preservation of indigenous languages. The work was carried out at the TecNM/Apizaco Institute of Technology (ITA) and supported by the Secretariat of Science, Humanities, Technology and Innovation (SECIHTI)."

    "abstract": "The evolution of telecommunication networks into 6G has introduced a paradigm shift, aiming to incorporate diverse and heterogeneous technologies along with targeting specialized use-cases tailored to private networks. Furthermore, the increased disaggregation of the network has enabled the ubiquity of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) to function on Commercially-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware, opening an ecosystem of open interfaces and open software. Owing to this evolution, the management complexity of the network also grows correspondingly, mandating a shift in approach. In contrast to the static Policy Based Management and Control (PBMC) which requires the management system to be well thought out during the design phase, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to learn and address the requirements during the run-time, introducing flexibility and adaptability, making it easier for the operator to manage and at the same time reducing operations and costs to design the management system. This article presents the incorporation of Large Language Model (LLM) adapted to Knowledge Graph (KG) for the purpose of intelligently triggering and coordinating handover in an Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) system, thus anchoring KG as the intermediate representation and digital twin of knowledge."

The first two were formally verified in a previous paper using the CSP process algebra, and in this paper, we use the same approach to formally verify the third one, in two phases. In the first phase, we construct the CSP model as a faithful representation of the real Python code. In the second phase, the model checker PAT automatically proves correctness of the third generic algorithm by proving its deadlock freeness (safety property) and successful termination (liveness property)."

    "abstract": "Smart Grids represent the future of sustainable and intelligent energy management; however, their distributed, heterogeneous, and dynamic nature introduces critical security and trust challenges. Traditional cybersecurity approaches often fall short in modeling the uncertainty and partial knowledge inherent in Smart Grid environments. In this paper, we propose a novel formal trust-based framework for evaluating the security of Smart Grids under uncertainty. Our approach extends the Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic of Trust (PCTLT) with a group operator, resulting in the Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic of Group Trust (PCTLT+). We use this logic to formally specify trust-related security properties and verify them using a model checking technique. A scenario of a Smart Grid Energy Management System is introduced to illustrate key security concerns, such as device authenticity, data integrity, privacy protection, and command legitimacy. The proposed framework enables rigorous and interpretable reasoning about security through quantifiable trust relationships, providing a foundation for developing resilient and scalable Smart Grid infrastructures. Our work addresses a critical gap in current Smart Grid research by formally incorporating trust and uncertainty into the security evaluation process."

    "abstract": "Traditional chemical automation systems typically rely on specialized scripting languages or fixed execution formats, which severely constrain user experience and the flexibility of experimental control. To address the limitations inherent in conventional experimental planning and execution workflows, we propose an interactive experiment automation framework driven by large language models. This framework is capable of comprehending natural language instructions through multi-turn dialogues and converting them into structured experimental plans, which are subsequently validated and executed by robotic systems. We conducted experiments to evaluate the system’s accuracy, generalizability, and robustness across diverse scenarios. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the intelligence and usability of laboratory automation."

    "abstract": "Handwriting verification is one form of biometrics. Among its various approaches, finger-writing verification of a simple symbol is the most convenient, in which a user is verified by writing a simple symbol with a finger on a smartphone screen. In a previous study, an error rate of 11.9% was achieved. Furthermore, by selecting and fusing individually high-performing features, an equivalent error rate was obtained, even though the number of used features was reduced. In this study, we propose a new feature selection method focusing on individuality, and a fusion method that combines this with three other selection methods. By using the proposed method, we finally achieved the error rate of 5.8%."

    "abstract": "Multi-authority Attribute-based Encryption (MAABE) schemes distribute the responsibility of managing the scheme attributes and attribute keys among several attribute authorities. However, MA-ABE schemes often assume that the attribute authorities are always fully trusted parties and lack authenticity checks. This paper proposes a Ciphertext-Policy MAABE scheme that incorporates a user-authority mutual authentication mechanism exploiting the properties of Zero-Knowledge Proofs. A batch version of the Schnorr protocol validates the authority identity and the possession of claimed attribute keys. The complete scheme is enhanced using asymmetric pairings to improve security and performance. Furthermore, outsourced decryption is considered to exploit the available computing resources under a fog-enabled IoT environment. The proposed scheme's analysis shows the overall construction's efficiency and, particularly, the efficiency and suitability of the mutual verification protocol."

A motion analysis system (Vicon Inc., U.K.) was used to assess the robot’s braking performance in automated operation modes, including interactions with non-fixed obstacles. Braking distance and braking time were analyzed before and after improvements to the control algorithm. After the improvement, the average braking distance was shortened to 20.5 mm across all conditions. This study provides empirical data supporting performance enhancement and safety certification of service robots."
