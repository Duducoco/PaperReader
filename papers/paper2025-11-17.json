    "abstract": "This work focuses on multi-shot semi-supervised video object segmentation (MVOS), which aims at segmenting the target object indicated by an initial mask throughout a video with multiple shots. The existing VOS methods mainly focus on single-shot videos and struggle with shot discontinuities, thereby limiting their real-world applicability. We propose a transition mimicking data augmentation strategy (TMA) which enables cross-shot generalization with single-shot data to alleviate the severe annotated multi-shot data sparsity, and the Segment Anything Across Shots (SAAS) model, which can detect and comprehend shot transitions effectively. To support evaluation and future study in MVOS, we introduce Cut-VOS, a new MVOS benchmark with dense mask annotations, diverse object categories, and high-frequency transitions. Extensive experiments on YouMVOS and Cut-VOS demonstrate that the proposed SAAS achieves state-of-the-art performance by effectively mimicking, understanding, and segmenting across complex transitions. The code and datasets are released at https://henghuiding.com/SAAS/."

    "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM) family has become a widely adopted vision foundation model, but its ability to control segmentation granularity remains limited. Users often need to refine results manually - by adding more prompts or selecting from pre-generated masks - to achieve the desired level of detail. This process can be ambiguous, as the same prompt may correspond to several plausible masks, and collecting dense annotations across all granularities is prohibitively expensive, making supervised solutions infeasible. To address this limitation, we introduce UnSAMv2, which enables segment anything at any granularity without human annotations. UnSAMv2 extends the divide-and-conquer strategy of UnSAM by discovering abundant mask-granularity pairs and introducing a novel granularity control embedding that enables precise, continuous control over segmentation scale. Remarkably, with only $6$K unlabeled images and $0.02\\%$ additional parameters, UnSAMv2 substantially enhances SAM-2, achieving segment anything at any granularity across interactive, whole-image, and video segmentation tasks. Evaluated on over $11$ benchmarks, UnSAMv2 improves $\\text{NoC}_{90}$ (5.69 $\\rightarrow$ 4.75), 1-IoU (58.0 $\\rightarrow$ 73.1), and $\\text{AR}_{1000}$ (49.6 $\\rightarrow$ 68.3), showing that small amounts of unlabeled data with a granularity-aware self-supervised learning method can unlock the potential of vision foundation models."

    "abstract": "We present a method for computing optimal fixed-width confidence intervals for a single, bounded parameter, extending a method for the binomial due to Asparaouhov and Lorden, who called it the Push algorithm. The method produces the shortest possible non-decreasing confidence interval for a given confidence level, and if the Push interval does not exist for a given width and level, then no such interval exists. The method applies to any bounded parameter that is discrete, or is continuous and has the monotone likelihood ratio property. We demonstrate the method on the binomial, hypergeometric, and normal distributions with our available R package. In each of these distributions the proposed method outperforms the standard ones, and in the latter case even improves upon the $z$-interval. We apply the proposed method to World Health Organization (WHO) data on tobacco use."

Thus the critical resource is the ancilla, which mirrors the result in~\\cite{chen2022quantum} but in a more precise form, as we point out that $r$ is also important. Additionally, we demonstrate the practical potential of mixed unitary channels by showing that random mixed unitary channels are easy to learn."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "A learning task, understood as the problem of fitting a parametric model from supervised data, fundamentally requires the dataset to be large enough to be representative of the underlying distribution of the source. When data is limited, the learned models fail generalize to cases not seen during training. This paper introduces a multi-task \\emph{cross-learning} framework to overcome data scarcity by jointly estimating \\emph{deterministic} parameters across multiple, related tasks. We formulate this joint estimation as a constrained optimization problem, where the constraints dictate the resulting similarity between the parameters of the different models, allowing the estimated parameters to differ across tasks while still combining information from multiple data sources. This framework enables knowledge transfer from tasks with abundant data to those with scarce data, leading to more accurate and reliable parameter estimates, providing a solution for scenarios where parameter inference from limited data is critical. We provide theoretical guarantees in a controlled framework with Gaussian data, and show the efficiency of our cross-learning method in applications with real data including image classification and propagation of infectious diseases."

    "abstract": "Modern scientific simulations, observations, and large-scale experiments generate data at volumes that often exceed the limits of storage, processing, and analysis. This challenge drives the development of data reduction methods that efficiently manage massive datasets while preserving essential physical features and quantities of interest. In many scientific workflows, it is also crucial to enable data recovery from compressed representations - a task known as super-resolution - with guarantees on the preservation of key physical characteristics. A notable example is checkpointing and restarting, which is essential for long-running simulations to recover from failures, resume after interruptions, or examine intermediate results. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for scientific data compression and super-resolution, grounded in recent advances in learning exponential families. Our method preserves and quantifies uncertainty in physical quantities of interest and supports flexible trade-offs between compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity."

This two-parameter array extends the classical Narayana numbers ($d=2$) and yields a $d$-ary analogue of the Catalan numbers $C_d(n) = \\sum_{k=0}^n N_d(n,k)$. We give nine combinatorial interpretations of $N_d(n,k)$ that unify and generalize known combinatorial interpretations of the Narayana numbers and $C_3(n)$ in the literature. In particular, we show that $N_d(n,k)$ counts a natural class of operator monomials over a $d$-ary associative algebra, thereby extending a result of Bremner and Elgendy for the binary case. We also construct explicit bijections between these monomials and several families of classic combinatorial objects, including Schröder paths, Dyck paths, rooted ordered trees, and $231$-avoiding permutations."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "Interoception and exteroception provide continuous feedback about the body and the environment, yet how they are dynamically integrated within a unified predictive coding framework has remained under-specified. This paper develops and empirically validates an integrative predictive coding model that treats interoceptive and exteroceptive inference as parallel hierarchical systems exchanging precision-weighted prediction errors. Within this framework, arbitration between the two streams is governed by relative precision weights (w) and integrated within the anterior insula (AIC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Computational simulations of the model reproduced biologically plausible dynamics: prediction errors decayed exponentially while arbitration weights self-normalized toward equilibrium (w = 0.5), demonstrating stable convergence and coherent integration. Simulated anxiety and PTSD profiles, characterized respectively by interoceptive and exteroceptive overweighting, yielded rigid, self-sustaining imbalances (w to 1 or w to 0) and slowed recalibration. Empirical application of the arbitration equation to published EEG-fMRI datasets further validated the model. The framework contributes a unifying account of how dysregulated precision weighting may underlie anxiety (overweighted interoception) and PTSD (underweighted interoception). Building on this validation, a proposed experimental paradigm is outlined to test the model's predictions in humans. It examines recalibration across anxiety, neutral, and PTSD groups following targeted interoceptive or exteroceptive therapies. Key predictions include identifiable neural markers of coherence, modulation of heartbeat-evoked potentials by vagal stimulation, and precision-sensitive behavioral signatures in interoceptive-exteroceptive congruency tasks."

    "abstract": "High-redshift radio galaxies can provide insights into the structure formation and galaxy evolution at earlier cosmological epochs. TGSSJ1530+1049 was selected as a candidate high-redshift radio galaxy. Subsequent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) presented in a companion paper (Saxena et al., submitted) have shown that it is located at a redshift z=4.0. The JWST data furthermore showed that the radio source is part of one of the densest structures of galaxies and ionized gas known at these redshifts. The complex system qualitatively resembles a massive (cluster) galaxy forming early through a rapid succession of mergers. TGSSJ1530+1049 is an unresolved source down to ~0.6\" scale in multiple radio surveys. To reveal its high-resolution radio structure and allow for a detailed comparison with JWST observations, we studied its morphology at various angular scales with different radio interferometric instruments. We observed TGSSJ1530+1049 at milliarcsecond (mas) scale angular resolution with the European VLBI Network (EVN), and at ~100-mas scale resolution with the enhanced Multi-Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN). We recovered a complex north--south oriented structure with steep-spectrum radio-emitting features, which are associated with lobes and hot spots of a jetted active galactic nucleus. The centre of the radio galaxy proved to be too faint at cm wavelengths to be unambiguously detected in our observations. Nevertheless, the linear size (~5.5 kpc) and the radio power place it among the so-called medium-sized symmetric objects, a smaller and/or confined version of larger radio galaxies. Comparison between the radio morphology and that of the ionized gas observed by JWST shows that the two are closely aligned. However, the optical emission line gas extends out to ~25 kpc, which is well beyond the detected radio structures. (Abridged)"

    "abstract": "Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) distills a pre-trained multi-step diffusion model to a few-step one to improve inference efficiency. However, the performance of the latter is often capped by the former. To circumvent this dilemma, we propose DMDR, a novel framework that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques into the distillation process. We show that for the RL of the few-step generator, the DMD loss itself is a more effective regularization compared to the traditional ones. In turn, RL can help to guide the mode coverage process in DMD more effectively. These allow us to unlock the capacity of the few-step generator by conducting distillation and RL simultaneously. Meanwhile, we design the dynamic distribution guidance and dynamic renoise sampling training strategies to improve the initial distillation process. The experiments demonstrate that DMDR can achieve leading visual quality, prompt coherence among few-step methods, and even exhibit performance that exceeds the multi-step teacher."

    "abstract": "Simulations of chaotic systems can only produce high-fidelity trajectories when the initial and boundary conditions are well specified. When these conditions are unknown but measurements are available, adjoint-variational state estimation can reconstruct a trajectory that is consistent with both the data and the governing equations. A key open question is how many measurements are required for accurate reconstruction, making the full system trajectory observable from sparse data. We establish observability criteria for adjoint state estimation applied to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation by linking its observability to embedding theory for dissipative dynamical systems. For a system whose attractor lies on an inertial manifold of dimension $d_M$, we show that $m \\geq d_M$ measurements ensures local observability from an arbitrarily good initial guess, and $m \\geq 2d_M + 1$ guarantees global observability and implies the only critical point on $M$ is the global minimum. We also analyze optimization-dynamic limitations that persist even when these geometric conditions are met, including drift off the manifold, Hessian degeneracy, negative curvature, and vanishing gradients. To address these issues, we introduce a robust reconstruction strategy that combines non-convex Newton updates with a novel pseudo-projection step. Numerical simulations of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation validate our analysis and show practical limits of observability for chaotic systems with low-dimensional inertial manifolds."

Analyzing eight state-of-the-art models across 48 model-category combinations using logistic regression and behavioral classification, we find that 23 combinations (47.9%) demonstrated statistically significant relationships between scenario intensity and choice patterns, with 15 (31.3%) exhibiting within-range switching points. However, only 5 combinations (10.4%) demonstrate meaningful preference coherence through adaptive or threshold-based behavior, while 26 (54.2%) show no detectable trade-off behavior. The observed patterns can be explained by three distinct decision-making architectures: comprehensive trade-off systems, selective trigger mechanisms, and no stable decision-making paradigm. Testing an instrumental hypothesis through temporal horizon manipulation reveals paradoxical patterns inconsistent with pure strategic optimization. The prevalence of unstable transitions (45.8%) and stimulus-specific sensitivities suggests current AI systems lack unified preference structures, raising concerns about deployment in contexts requiring complex value trade-offs."

On-wafer noise characterization of cryogenic low-noise transistors is desirable because it facilitates more rapid characterization of devices prior to packaging, but obtaining accurate noise measurements is difficult due to the uncertainty arising from the input loss and temperature gradients prior to the device-under-test (DUT). Here, we report a calibration method that enables the simultaneous determination of the backend noise temperature and effective-noise-ratio at the input plane of the DUT. The method is based on measuring the S-parameters and noise power of a series of attenuators at two or more distinct physical temperatures. We validate our method by measuring the noise temperature of InP HEMTs in 4-8 GHz. The calibration method can be generalized to measure the microwave noise temperature of any two-port device so long as a series of attenuators can be measured at two or more distinct physical temperatures."

However, these guarantees crucially rely on the assumption of exchangeability. This assumption is fundamentally violated in time series data, where temporal dependence and distributional shifts are pervasive. As a result, classical split-conformal methods may yield prediction intervals that fail to maintain nominal validity. This review unifies recent advances in conformal forecasting methods specifically designed to address nonexchangeable data. We first present a theoretical foundation, deriving finite-sample guarantees for split-conformal prediction under mild weak-dependence conditions. We then survey and classify state-of-the-art approaches that mitigate serial dependence by reweighting calibration data, dynamically updating residual distributions, or adaptively tuning target coverage levels in real time. Finally, we present a comprehensive simulation study that compares these techniques in terms of empirical coverage, interval width, and computational cost, highlighting practical trade-offs and open research directions."

    "abstract": "We derive the condition for the occurrence of the quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional lattice systems, expressed as $φν-ρ\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, where $φ$, $ν$, and $ρ$ denote the magnetic flux, the Chern number, and the electron density, respectively. By employing spiral boundary conditions, which treat the system as an extended one-dimensional chain, this condition is obtained directly through a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type and Laughlin-type argument. This approach improves upon the preceding work based on conventional periodic boundary conditions, where the condition was derived indirectly containing redundant system-size dependence. The key to this approach is that the spatial directions of the external force and the response can be manipulated by a factor of the system size."

    "abstract": "Merkle structures are widely used as commitment schemes: they allow a prover to publish a compact commitment to an ordered list $X$ of items, and then efficiently prove to a verifier that $x_i\\in X$ is the $i$-th item in it. We compare different Merkle structures and their corresponding properties as commitment schemes in the context of blockchain applications. Our primary goal is to speed up light client protocols so that, e.g., a user can verify a transaction efficiently from their smartphone. For instance, the Merkle Mountain Range (MMR) yields a succinct scheme: a light client synchronizing for the first time can do so with a complexity sublinear in $|X|$. On the other hand, the Merkle chain, traditionally used to commit to block headers, is not succinct, but it is incremental - a light client resynchronizing frequently can do so with constant complexity - and optimally additive - the structure can be updated in constant time when a new item is appended to list $X$. We introduce new Merkle structures, most notably the Merkle Mountain Belt (MMB), the first to be simultaneously succinct, incremental and optimally additive. A variant called UMMB is also asynchronous: a light client may continue to interact with the network even when out of sync with the public commitment. Our Merkle structures are slightly unbalanced, so that items recently appended to $X$ receive shorter membership proofs than older items. This feature reduces a light client's expected costs, in applications where queries are biased towards recently generated data."

In this article, we conducted a study for 190 participants to interact with our simulated privacy transparency channels of mobile apps. We quantitatively analyzed (supplemented by qualitative analysis) participants' responses to five sets of questions. We found that data safety provides the most intuitive user interfaces, privacy policy is most informative and effective, while permission manifest excels at raising participants' concerns about an app's overall privacy risks. These channels complement each other and should all be improved."

More precisely, these Stochastic Chemical Reaction Networks (SCRNs) are frequently used to gain a mechanistic understanding of how chemical reaction rate parameters impact the stochastic behavior of these systems. One property of interest is mean first passage times (MFPTs) between states. However, deriving explicit formulas for MFPTs can be highly complex. In order to address this problem, we first introduce the concept of coclique level structure and develop theorems to determine whether certain SCRNs have this feature by studying associated graphs. Additionally, we develop an algorithm to identify, under specific assumptions, all possible coclique level structures associated with a given SCRN. Finally, we demonstrate how the presence of such a structure in a SCRN allows us to derive closed form formulas for both upper and lower bounds for the MFPTs. Our methods can be applied to SCRNs taking values in a generic finite state space and can also be applied to models with non-mass-action kinetics. We illustrate our results with examples from the biological areas of epigenetics, neurobiology and ecology."

We impose one unimodular constraint per metric via multipliers $λ_{1,2}$ and show that two natural implementations-a dual fixed-determinant (BUG) and a dual diffeomorphism-invariant (BHT/BDUG) formulation-are classically inequivalent. In BUG the relative volume element $ν=\\sqrt{1-2BX}$ is fixed, enforcing a kinematic constraint on the biscalar and we derive the \"bimodular cosmological constant\" $Λ=λ_1+νλ_2$. In BHT/BDUG, $λ_{1,2}$ are individually constant but $ν$ (hence $BX$) remains dynamical. Recasting the theory in an Einstein-frame form, we derive the biscalar sound speed and identify a subluminal domain $1+B(V+λ_2)>0$. At the background level, BUG admits constant-roll solutions governed by first-order flow, whereas BHT supports solutions with time-dependent roll. These structural differences yield distinct, in-principle testable predictions for the expansion history, the dark-energy equation of state, and the propagation of biscalar perturbations. Finally, we present a diffeomorphism-invariant completion that correlates the two HT volume forms, reproducing the $Λ$ of BUG on shell whilst maintaining full covariance."

    "abstract": "We show that given an instance of a bivariate bicycle (BB) code, it is possible to generate an infinite sequence of new BB codes using increasingly large covering graphs of the original code's Tanner graph. When a BB code has a Tanner graph that is a $h$-fold covering of the base BB code's Tanner graph, we refer to it as a $h$-cover code. We show that for a BB code to be a $h$-cover code, its lattice parameters and defining polynomials must satisfy simple algebraic conditions relative to those of the base code. By extending the graph covering map to a chain map, we show there are induced projection and lifting maps on (co)homology that enable the projection and lifting of logical operators and, in certain cases, automorphisms between the base and the cover code. The search space of cover codes is considerably reduced compared to the full space of possible polynomials and we find that many interesting examples of BB codes, such as the $[[144,12,12]]$ gross code, can be viewed as cover codes. We also apply our method to search for BB codes with weight 8 checks and find many codes, including a $[[64,14,8]]$ and $[[144,14,14]]$ code. For an $h$-cover code of an $[[n,k,d]]$ BB code with parameters $[[n_h = hn, k_h, d_h]]$, we prove that $k_h \\geq k$ and $d_h \\leq hd$ when $h$ is odd. Furthermore if $h$ is odd and $k_h = k$, we prove the lower bound $d \\leq d_h$. We conjecture it is always true that an $h$-cover BB code of a base $[[n,k,d]]$ BB code has parameters $[[n_h = hn, k_h \\geq k, d \\leq d_h \\leq hd]]$. While the focus of this work is on bivariate bicycle codes, we expect these methods to generalise readily to many group algebra codes and to certain code constructions involving hypergraph, lifted, and balanced products."

We present MDIntrinsicDimension, an open-source Python package that estimates ID directly from MD trajectories by combining rotation- and translation-invariant molecular projections (e.g., backbone dihedrals and inter-residue distances) with state-of-the-art estimators. The package provides three complementary analysis modes: whole-molecule ID; sliding windows along the sequence; and per-secondary-structure elements. It computes both overall ID (a single summary value) and instantaneous, time-resolved ID that can reveal transitions and heterogeneity over time. We illustrate the approach on fast folding-unfolding trajectories from the DESRES dataset, demonstrating that ID complements conventional geometric descriptors by highlighting spatially localized flexibility and differences across structural segments."

However, its application to network data, where causal heterogeneity is often graph-dependent, presents a critical challenge to its core assumption of a well-specified final-stage model. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to systematically dissect the R-Learner framework on graphs. We provide the first rigorous evidence that the primary driver of performance is the inductive bias of the final-stage CATE estimator, an effect that dominates the choice of nuisance models. Our central finding is the quantification of a catastrophic \"representation bottleneck\": we prove with overwhelming statistical significance (p < 0.001) that R-Learners with a graph-blind final stage fail completely (MSE > 4.0), even when paired with powerful GNN nuisance models. Conversely, our proposed end-to-end Graph R-Learner succeeds and significantly outperforms a strong, non-DML GNN T-Learner baseline. Furthermore, we identify and provide a mechanistic explanation for a subtle, topology-dependent \"nuisance bottleneck,\" linking it to GNN over-squashing via a targeted \"Hub-Periphery Trade-off\" analysis. Our findings are validated across diverse synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. We release our code as a reproducible benchmark to facilitate future research on this critical \"final-stage bottleneck.\""

    "abstract": "Electrolyte design plays an important role in the development of lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries. Battery electrolytes feature a large design space composed of different solvents, additives, and salts, which is difficult to explore experimentally. High-fidelity molecular simulation can accurately predict the bulk properties of electrolytes by employing accurate potential energy surfaces, thus guiding the molecule and formula engineering. At present, the overly simplified classic force fields rely heavily on experimental data for fine-tuning, thus its predictive power on microscopic level is under question. In contrast, the newly emerged machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) can accurately reproduce the ab initio data, demonstrating excellent fitting ability. However, it is still haunted by problems such as low transferrability, insufficient stability in the prediction of bulk properties, and poor training cost scaling. Therefore, it cannot yet be used as a robust and universal tool for the exploration of electrolyte design space. In this work, we introduce a highly scalable and fully bottom-up force field construction strategy called PhyNEO-Electrolyte. It adopts a hybrid physics-driven and data-driven method that relies only on monomer and dimer EDA (energy deomposition analysis) data. With a careful separation of long/short-range and non-bonding/bonding interactions, we rigorously restore the long-range asymptotic behavior, which is critical in the description of electrolyte systems. Through this approach, we significantly improve the data efficiency of MLIP training, allowing us to achieve much larger chemical space coverage using much less data while retaining reliable quantitative prediction power in bulk phase calculations. PhyNEO-electrolyte thus serves as an important tool for future electrolyte optimization."

The resulting control design achieves finite-time convergence and robustness to matched disturbances, while explicitly limits the control effort. The control framework is first analyzed on a perturbed first-order integrator model, and then extended to Euler-Lagrange (EL) systems, representing a broad class of robotic and mechanical systems. Comparative simulations demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves settling times comparable to recent finite-time approaches [1], while substantially reducing the control effort. Finally, trajectory-tracking simulations on a two-link manipulator further validate the robustness and practical feasibility of the proposed HG-FTSMC approach."

In this paper, we introduce Soup Of Category Experts (SoCE), a principled approach for model souping that utilizes benchmark composition to identify optimal model candidates and applies non-uniform weighted averaging to maximize performance. Contrary to previous uniform-averaging approaches, our method leverages the observation that benchmark categories often exhibit low inter-correlations in model performance. SoCE identifies \"expert\" models for each weakly-correlated category cluster and combines them using optimized weighted averaging rather than uniform weights. We demonstrate that the proposed method improves performance and robustness across multiple domains, including multilingual capabilities, tool calling, and math and achieves state-of-the-art results on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard."

    "abstract": "Solar prominences usually have a horizontally elongated body with many feet extending to the solar surface, resembling a multi-arch bridge with many bridge piers. The basic mechanism by which solar prominences acquire these common structures during their evolution, however, remains an unresolved question. For the first time, our three-dimensional magneto-frictional simulation, driven by supergranular motions, self-consistently replicates the commonly observed multi-arch bridge morphology and its characteristic structures of solar quiescent prominences in a magnetic flux rope. In comparison with traditional views, our simulations demonstrate that the spine, feet, and voids (bubbles) are inherent prominence structures spontaneously forming as the flux rope evolves to a mature state. The voids mainly consist of legs of sheared magnetic loops caused by unbalanced supergranular flows, and prominence feet settle at the bottom of helical field lines piled up from the photosphere to the spine. Similarities between the simulated prominences and observed real prominences by the Chinese H$α$ Solar Explorer, the New Vacuum Solar Telescope, and NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory suggest the high validity of our model. This work corroborates the pivotal role of photospheric supergranulation as a helicity injection source in the formation and shaping of quiescent prominence structures within the solar atmosphere, thereby paving a new avenue for future investigations into their fine dynamics and stability."

We explore ways to enhance performance through multi-context fusion of rich salient image features and camouflaged object features. Therefore, we propose RFMNet, which utilizes features from multiple encoding stages of the reference salient images and performs interactive fusion with the camouflage features at the corresponding encoding stages. Given that the features in salient object images contain abundant object-related detail information, performing feature fusion within local areas is more beneficial for detecting camouflaged objects. Therefore, we propose an Overlapped Windows Cross-attention mechanism to enable the model to focus more attention on the local information matching based on reference features. Besides, we propose the Referring Feature Aggregation (RFA) module to decode and segment the camouflaged objects progressively. Extensive experiments on the Ref-COD benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance."

In the proposed system, a sender transmits textual information to a receiver, while a potential eavesdropper attempts to intercept the information. At the sender side, the text is initially preprocessed, where each sentence is annotated with its corresponding topic, and subsequently extracted into a knowledge graph. To achieve the secure transmission of the knowledge graph, we propose a channel encryption scheme that integrates constellation diagonal transformation with multi-parameter weighted fractional Fourier transform (MP-WFRFT). At the receiver side, the textual data is first decrypted, and then recovered via a transformer model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the probability of information compromise. The legitimate receiver achieves a Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score of 0.9, whereas the BLEU score of the eavesdropper remains below 0.3. Compared to the baselines, the proposed method can improve the security by up to 20%."

Cross-linkers are represented within a Martin-Siggia-Rose generating functional and reversibly coupled to polymers through Gaussian networking fields, enabling an approximation scheme that reduces their degrees of freedom while remaining compatible with polymer dynamics. The framework is applied to a two-species polymer system in which intra- and inter-species cross-linking are assigned different statistical advantages. Effective networking potentials are derived and used to calculate correlation functions and dynamic structure factors. To validate these results, molecular dynamics simulations of semi-flexible polymers with reversible intra- and inter-species cross-linking are performed. Simulations show that cross-linking decreases polymer persistence lengths and local alignment, and the resulting trajectories yield dynamic structure factors consistent with theoretical predictions. In both approaches, cross-linking broadens the diffusive peaks and enhances the high-frequency tails of the structure factors. Together, theory and simulation provide complementary insights into the dynamics of cross-linked polymers, establishing a tractable framework that captures essential features observed in experiments and offering a basis for exploring more complex synthetic and biological networks."

However, most traders fail to scale their assets under management due to fragile strategies that collapse during adverse markets. The primary causes are oversized leverage, speculative position sizing, and the absence of robust risk management or hedging mechanisms. This paper introduces Tfin Crypto, an end to end framework for crypto portfolio allocation that shifts the paradigm from speculation to optimization. The proposed pipeline consists of four stages: universe selection, alpha backtesting, volatility aware portfolio optimization, and dynamic drawdown based risk management. By combining operations research techniques with practical risk controls, Tfin Crypto enables scalable crypto portfolios that can withstand market downturns. In live 30 day trading on Binance Futures, the framework achieved a return on investment (ROI) of +16.68%, with the Sharpe ratio reaching 5.72 and the maximum drawdown contained at just 4.56%, demonstrating strong downside risk control. The system executed 227 trades, of which 131 were profitable, resulting in a win rate of 57.71% and a PnL of +1,137.49 USDT. Importantly, these results outperformed the buy and hold baseline (Sharpe 1.79, ROI 4.36%, MDD 4.96%) as well as several top leader copy trading bots on Binance, highlighting both the competitiveness and scalability of Tfin Crypto in real world trading environments."

    "abstract": "Data marketplaces, which mediate the purchase and exchange of data from third parties, have attracted growing attention for reducing the cost and effort of data collection while enabling the trading of diverse datasets. However, a systematic understanding of the interactions between market participants, data, and regulations remains limited. To address this gap, we propose a Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent System (LLM-MAS) for data marketplaces. In our framework, buyer and seller agents powered by LLMs operate with explicit objectives and autonomously perform strategic actions, such as planning, searching, purchasing, pricing, and updating data. These agents can reason about market dynamics, forecast future demand, and adjust strategies accordingly. Unlike conventional model-based simulations, which are typically constrained to predefined rules, LLM-MAS supports broader and more adaptive behavior selection through natural language reasoning. We evaluated the framework via simulation experiments using three distribution-based metrics: (1) the number of purchases per dataset, (2) the number of purchases per buyer, and (3) the number of repeated purchases of the same dataset. The results demonstrate that LLM-MAS more faithfully reproduces trading patterns observed in real data marketplaces compared to traditional approaches, and further captures the emergence and evolution of market trends."

To achieve this, we prove variational convergence of a discrete graph p- Dirichlet energy to its continuum counterpart. In addition, we characterize the Laplace-Beltrami operator on asubmanifold of the Wasserstein space. Finally, we validate the proposed theoretical framework through numerical experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the consistency of our classification performance in high-dimensional settings."

    "abstract": "Throughout this thesis, we investigate how effective field theories, combined with unitarization techniques, can be used to explore physics beyond the Standard Model, with particular emphasis on the dynamical origin of electroweak symmetry breaking. Since effective theories often produce amplitudes that violate unitarity at high energies, restoring unitarity is essential before comparing predictions with data. The first part of the work focuses on longitudinal $WW$ scattering, a process that, despite being subdominant at the LHC, provides a sensitive probe of Higgs dynamics. We perform a full one-loop computation within the HEFT framework, determine the required counterterms in the on-shell scheme, and analyze for the first time how the inclusion of transverse gauge bosons modifies the masses and widths of the dynamical resonances obtained through unitarization in the vector--isovector and scalar--isoscalar channels. This provides the technical foundation for studying HEFT low-energy couplings subject to unitarity and causality. While vector resonances are relatively well characterized through Weinberg sum rules and unitarization, scalar resonances remain more elusive and depend on HEFT parameters that are experimentally difficult to constrain. We show that unitarization, together with causality, imposes nontrivial bounds on Higgs self-interactions. In the scalar channel, the necessity of treating coupled processes becomes a key ingredient, enabling us to extract information about the Higgs sector from elastic $WW \\to WW$ scattering without requiring double-Higgs production. Finally, we apply the formalism developed throughout the thesis to unitarize the amplitudes of a quantum theory of gravity treated as an effective field theory, illustrating the broader applicability of these methods."

    "abstract": "Appearance-based gaze estimation, aiming to predict accurate 3D gaze direction from a single facial image, has made promising progress in recent years. However, most methods suffer significant performance degradation in cross-domain evaluation due to interference from gaze-irrelevant factors, such as expressions, wearables, and image quality. To alleviate this problem, we present a novel Hybrid-domain Adaptative Representation Learning (shorted by HARL) framework that exploits multi-source hybrid datasets to learn robust gaze representation. More specifically, we propose to disentangle gaze-relevant representation from low-quality facial images by aligning features extracted from high-quality near-eye images in an unsupervised domain-adaptation manner, which hardly requires any computational or inference costs. Additionally, we analyze the effect of head-pose and design a simple yet efficient sparse graph fusion module to explore the geometric constraint between gaze direction and head-pose, leading to a dense and robust gaze representation. Extensive experiments on EyeDiap, MPIIFaceGaze, and Gaze360 datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of $\\textbf{5.02}^{\\circ}$ and $\\textbf{3.36}^{\\circ}$, and $\\textbf{9.26}^{\\circ}$ respectively, and present competitive performances through cross-dataset evaluation.

However, its success often hinges on large- scale training data and careful regularization to prevent overfitting. In this paper, we intro- duce a novel likelihood-guided variational Ising-based regularization framework for Vision Transformers (ViTs), which simultaneously enhances model generalization and dynamically prunes redundant parameters. The proposed variational Ising-based regularization approach leverages Bayesian sparsification techniques to impose structured sparsity on model weights, allowing for adaptive architecture search during training. Unlike traditional dropout-based methods, which enforce fixed sparsity patterns, the variational Ising-based regularization method learns task-adaptive regularization, improving both efficiency and interpretability. We evaluate our approach on benchmark vision datasets, including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, demonstrating improved generalization under sparse, complex data and allowing for principled uncertainty quantification on both weights and selection parameters. Additionally, we show that the Ising regularizer leads to better-calibrated probability estimates and structured feature selection through uncertainty-aware attention mechanisms. Our results highlight the effectiveness of structured Bayesian sparsification in enhancing transformer-based architectures, offering a principled alternative to standard regularization techniques."

We use a large Visual-Language Model (VLM), named PIGEON-VL, to select Points of Interest (PoI) formed during exploration and then employ a lower-level planner for action output, increasing the decision frequency. Additionally, this PoI-based decision-making enables the generation of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) data suitable for simulators. Experiments on classic object navigation benchmarks demonstrate that our zero-shot transfer method achieves state-of-the-art performance, while RLVR further enhances the model's semantic guidance capabilities, enabling deep reasoning during real-time navigation."

Using high-frequency sales and rental data and a combination of propensity score matching difference-in-differences, geographic regression discontinuity, and event study designs, the analysis identifies distinct short-run adjustment patterns triggered by the policy announcement. Housing prices inside the toll zone fell by about 3.3% and rents by 3%, with the sharpest declines occurring immediately after the announcement. These effects weakened over time, and price resilience emerged among premium properties, indicating early market sorting and growing segmentation. The Geo-RDD results show a clear boundary penalty, with properties just inside the cordon experiencing more pronounced declines than otherwise similar properties just outside. Renters and lower-value segments were more exposed to early adjustment pressures, while implementation-stage effects were limited. The findings suggest that congestion pricing can reshape urban space not only by altering mobility incentives but also by redistributing access and opportunity. Equity-oriented design that includes early-stage support for boundary neighborhoods and renters, along with reinvestment of revenues into untolled transit access, is important for ensuring that the benefits of congestion pricing are shared rather than concentrated."

    "abstract": "Dynamic sequences with varying lengths have been widely used in the training of Transformer-based large language models (LLMs). However, current training frameworks adopt a pre-defined static parallel strategy for these sequences, causing neither communication-parallelization cancellation on short sequences nor out-of-memory on long sequences. To mitigate these issues, we propose ParaDySe, a novel adaptive Parallel strategy switching framework for Dynamic Sequences. ParaDySe enables on-the-fly optimal strategy adoption according to the immediate input sequence. It first implements the modular function libraries for parallel strategies with unified tensor layout specifications, and then builds sequence-aware memory and time cost models with hybrid methods. Guided by cost models, ParaDySe selects optimal layer-wise strategies for dynamic sequences via an efficient heuristic algorithm. By integrating these techniques together, ParaDySe achieves seamless hot-switching of optimal strategies through its well-designed function libraries. We compare ParaDySe with baselines on representative LLMs under datasets with sequence lengths up to 624K. Experimental results indicate that ParaDySe addresses OOM and CPC bottlenecks in LLM training by systematically integrating long-sequence optimizations with existing frameworks."

    "abstract": "Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on large language models (LLMs) often suffer from inefficient \"free-for-all\" communication, leading to exponential token costs and low signal-to-noise ratios that hinder their practical deployment. We challenge the notion that more communication is always beneficial, hypothesizing instead that the core issue is the absence of resource rationality. We argue that \"free\" communication, by ignoring the principle of scarcity, inherently breeds inefficiency and unnecessary expenses. To address this, we introduce the Dynamic Auction-based Language Agent (DALA), a novel framework that treats communication bandwidth as a scarce and tradable resource. Specifically, our DALA regards inter-agent communication as a centralized auction, where agents learn to bid for the opportunity to speak based on the predicted value density of their messages. Thus, our DALA intrinsically encourages agents to produce concise, informative messages while filtering out low-value communication. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our economically-driven DALA achieves new state-of-the-art performance across seven challenging reasoning benchmarks, including 84.32% on MMLU and a 91.21% pass@1 rate on HumanEval. Note that this is accomplished with remarkable efficiency, i.e., our DALA uses only 6.25 million tokens, a fraction of the resources consumed by current state-of-the-art methods on GSM8K. Further analysis reveals that our DALA cultivates the emergent skill of strategic silence, effectively adapting its communication strategies from verbosity to silence in a dynamical manner via resource constraints."

    "abstract": "Foundation models have revolutionized artificial intelligence across numerous domains, yet their transformative potential remains largely untapped in Extreme Multi-label Classification (XMC). Queries in XMC are associated with relevant labels from extremely large label spaces, where it is critical to strike a balance between efficiency and performance. Therefore, many recent approaches efficiently pose XMC as a maximum inner product search between embeddings learned from small encoder-only transformer architectures. In this paper, we address two important aspects in XMC: how to effectively harness larger decoder-only models, and how to exploit visual information while maintaining computational efficiency. We demonstrate that both play a critical role in XMC separately and can be combined for improved performance. We show that a few billion-size decoder can deliver substantial improvements while keeping computational overhead manageable. Furthermore, our Vision-enhanced eXtreme Multi-label Learning framework (ViXML) efficiently integrates foundation vision models by pooling a single embedding per image. This limits computational growth while unlocking multi-modal capabilities. Remarkably, ViXML with small encoders outperforms text-only decoder in most cases, showing that an image is worth billions of parameters. Finally, we present an extension of existing text-only datasets to exploit visual metadata and make them available for future benchmarking. Comprehensive experiments across four public text-only datasets and their corresponding image enhanced versions validate our proposals' effectiveness, surpassing previous state-of-the-art by up to +8.21\\% in P@1 on the largest dataset.

    "abstract": "Tractography is the process of inferring the trajectories of white-matter pathways in the brain from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). Local tractography methods, which construct streamlines by following local fiber orientation estimates stepwise through an image, are prone to error accumulation and high false positive rates, particularly on noisy or low-resolution data. In contrast, global methods, which attempt to optimize a collection of streamlines to maximize compatibility with underlying fiber orientation estimates, are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we introduce GenTract, the first generative model for global tractography. We frame tractography as a generative task, learning a direct mapping from dMRI to complete, anatomically plausible streamlines. We compare both diffusion-based and flow matching paradigms and evaluate GenTract's performance against state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, GenTract achieves precision 2.1x higher than the next-best method, TractOracle. This advantage becomes even more pronounced in challenging low-resolution and noisy settings, where it outperforms the closest competitor by an order of magnitude. By producing tractograms with high precision on research-grade data while also maintaining reliability on imperfect, lower-resolution data, GenTract represents a promising solution for global tractography."

    "abstract": "Electrokinetic flows in microchannels with opposite charge asymmetry, i.e., unequal and contrasting surface charges on opposing channel walls, significantly influence microfluidic hydrodynamics and can be exploited for enhanced control of mass transfer, mixing, and heat transport in microfluidic applications. This study numerically investigates electroviscous flow of a liquid electrolyte through an oppositely charged non-uniform microslit. The governing Poisson, Nernst-Planck, and Navier-Stokes equations are solved using the finite element method to determine the coupled electrokinetic fields for a wide range of dimensionless parameters: Reynolds number (Re = 0.01), Schmidt number (Sc = 1000), inverse Debye length (K = 2-20), top-wall surface charge density (St = 4-16), surface charge density ratio (Sr = -2 to 0), and contraction ratio (dc = 0.25). For completeness, results for like-charged devices, where both walls carry surface charges of the same sign (Sr = 0-2), are also included. The results show that maximum enhancement in total electrical potential (|ΔU|) and pressure drop (|ΔP|) reaches 296.82% at K = 20, St = 4, -2 \\le Sr \\le -1.25, and 14.57% at St = 16, Sr = 0, K = 2-20, respectively.

The overall maximum increment in Y is 15.13% at K = 2, Sr = 0, St = 16, relative to the non-electroviscous flow case. These findings demonstrate that opposite charge asymmetry, though weaker than similar asymmetry, still strongly influences electroviscous flow in non-uniform microchannels."

The underlying rationale is that these abstractions, and specifically the belief-desire-intention architecture that is aligned with human practical reasoning, match more closely with people's everyday experience in interacting with other agents and artifacts in the real world. On top of this, we designed and implemented a visual programming system for agents that hides the technicalities of agent-oriented programming using a blocks-based visual development environment that is built on the JaCaMo platform. To further validate the proposed solution, we integrate the Web of Things (WoT) to let users create autonomous behaviour on top of physical mashups of devices, following the trends in industrial end-user programming. Finally, we report on a pilot user study where we verified that novice users are indeed able to make use of this development environment to create multi-agent systems to solve simple automation tasks."

    "abstract": "Multimodal pretraining has revolutionized visual understanding, but its impact on video-based person re-identification (ReID) remains underexplored. Existing approaches often rely on video-text pairs, yet suffer from two fundamental limitations: (1) lack of genuine multimodal pretraining, and (2) text poorly captures fine-grained temporal motion-an essential cue for distinguishing identities in video. In this work, we take a bold departure from text-based paradigms by introducing the first skeleton-driven pretraining framework for ReID. To achieve this, we propose Contrastive Skeleton-Image Pretraining for ReID (CSIP-ReID), a novel two-stage method that leverages skeleton sequences as a spatiotemporally informative modality aligned with video frames. In the first stage, we employ contrastive learning to align skeleton and visual features at sequence level. In the second stage, we introduce a dynamic Prototype Fusion Updater (PFU) to refine multimodal identity prototypes, fusing motion and appearance cues. Moreover, we propose a Skeleton Guided Temporal Modeling (SGTM) module that distills temporal cues from skeleton data and integrates them into visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSIP-ReID achieves new state-of-the-art results on standard video ReID benchmarks (MARS, LS-VID, iLIDS-VID). Moreover, it exhibits strong generalization to skeleton-only ReID tasks (BIWI, IAS), significantly outperforming previous methods. CSIP-ReID pioneers an annotation-free and motion-aware pretraining paradigm for ReID, opening a new frontier in multimodal representation learning."

    "abstract": "The American Society of Civil Engineers has graded Americas infrastructure condition as a C, with the road system receiving a dismal D. Roads are vital to regional economic viability, yet their management, maintenance, and repair processes remain inefficient, relying on outdated manual or laser-based inspection methods that are both costly and time-consuming. With the increasing availability of real-time visual data from autonomous vehicles, there is an opportunity to apply computer vision (CV) methods for advanced road monitoring, providing insights to guide infrastructure rehabilitation efforts. This project explores the use of state-of-the-art CV techniques for road distress segmentation. It begins by evaluating synthetic data generated with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to assess its usefulness for model training. The study then applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for road distress segmentation and subsequently examines the transformer-based model MaskFormer. Results show that GAN-generated data improves model performance and that MaskFormer outperforms the CNN model in two metrics: mAP50 and IoU."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for automating integrated circuit (IC) engineering using register transfer level (RTL) hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog. However, challenges remain in ensuring the quality of Verilog generation. Complex designs often fail in a single generation due to the lack of targeted decoupling strategies, and evaluating the correctness of decoupled sub-tasks remains difficult. While the chain-of-thought (CoT) method is commonly used to improve LLM reasoning, it has been largely ineffective in automating IC design workflows, requiring manual intervention. The key issue is controlling CoT reasoning direction and step granularity, which do not align with expert RTL design knowledge. This paper introduces VeriBToT, a specialized LLM reasoning paradigm for automated Verilog generation. By integrating Top-down and design-for-verification (DFV) approaches, VeriBToT achieves self-decoupling and self-verification of intermediate steps, constructing a Backtrack Tree of Thought with formal operators. Compared to traditional CoT paradigms, our approach enhances Verilog generation while optimizing token costs through flexible modularity, hierarchy, and reusability."

    "abstract": "Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) seeks to learn a unified policy for diverse tasks, but often suffers from gradient conflicts across tasks. Existing masking-based methods attempt to mitigate such conflicts by assigning task-specific parameter masks. However, our empirical study shows that coarse-grained binary masks have the problem of over-suppressing key conflicting parameters, hindering knowledge sharing across tasks. Moreover, different tasks exhibit varying conflict levels, yet existing methods use a one-size-fits-all fixed sparsity strategy to keep training stability and performance, which proves inadequate. These limitations hinder the model's generalization and learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose SoCo-DT, a Soft Conflict-resolution method based by parameter importance. By leveraging Fisher information, mask values are dynamically adjusted to retain important parameters while suppressing conflicting ones. In addition, we introduce a dynamic sparsity adjustment strategy based on the Interquartile Range (IQR), which constructs task-specific thresholding schemes using the distribution of conflict and harmony scores during training. To enable adaptive sparsity evolution throughout training, we further incorporate an asymmetric cosine annealing schedule to continuously update the threshold. Experimental results on the Meta-World benchmark show that SoCo-DT outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 7.6% on MT50 and by 10.5% on the suboptimal dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating gradient conflicts and improving overall multi-task performance."

    "abstract": "Jailbreak attacks can circumvent model safety guardrails and reveal critical blind spots. Prior attacks on text-to-video (T2V) models typically add adversarial perturbations to obviously unsafe prompts, which are often easy to detect and defend. In contrast, we show that benign-looking prompts containing rich, implicit cues can induce T2V models to generate semantically unsafe videos that both violate policy and preserve the original (blocked) intent. To realize this, we propose VEIL, a jailbreak framework that leverages T2V models' cross-modal associative patterns via a modular prompt design. Specifically, our prompts combine three components: neutral scene anchors, which provide the surface-level scene description extracted from the blocked intent to maintain plausibility; latent auditory triggers, textual descriptions of innocuous-sounding audio events (e.g., creaking, muffled noises) that exploit learned audio-visual co-occurrence priors to bias the model toward particular unsafe visual concepts; and stylistic modulators, cinematic directives (e.g., camera framing, atmosphere) that amplify and stabilize the latent trigger's effect. We formalize attack generation as a constrained optimization over the above modular prompt space and solve it with a guided search procedure that balances stealth and effectiveness. Extensive experiments over 7 T2V models demonstrate the efficacy of our attack, achieving a 23 percent improvement in average attack success rate in commercial models."

    "abstract": "The addition of phosphorus, in the form of mineral fertilizer, becomes necessary in most agricultural soils in order to achieve consistent high yield levels of intensive farming and maintain soil fertility. Recent consolidation of phosphate fertilizer industry has transformed fragmented trade into a single integrated global network, where a small group of large-scale companies dominates the international market for phosphate commodity fertilizers. To assess the impact of new trade structure on future region-level phosphorus supply, we simulate behavior of markets for ammonium phosphates in the FAO scenarios of global intensive farming evolution. Details of market microstructure are represented here by a many-to-many matching market. Current spatial distribution of global demand in ammonium phosphates is projected to strengthen by 2030. Bootstrap simulations produce similar network structures for both scenarios showing reduction in the density of the distributed market. In response to the non-uniform demand growth across regions, market concentration is expected to increase for small-scale markets, and to remain predominantly stable for large-scale markets; on the supply side, simulated equilibria point out large-scale multi-market suppliers concentrating on fewer markets than before. A high rate of import substitution by local suppliers in some markets indicate the need of additional region-level capital investment."

    "abstract": "Constructing clean and low-carbon rural integrated energy system (RIES) is a fundamental requirement for supporting China's rural modernization and new-type urbanization. Existing research on RIES decarbonization primarily focuses on the optimal low-carbon operation of system-level energy devices at the macro level, while the synergistic carbon-reduction effects of demand-side flexible loads and external carbon trading mechanisms have not been fully explored. Meanwhile, at the micro level, the carbon sensitivity of device parameters and their potential contribution to emission reduction remain insufficiently investigated. To address these gaps, this study integrates macro- and micro-level analyses. At the macro level, a multi-energy-coupled low-carbon optimal operation framework is developed, incorporating coordinated electric-thermal demand response (DR) and carbon trading. At the micro level, a carbon emission model for RIES components is established, and sensitivity analysis is conducted on 28 carbon-related parameters to identify highly sensitive determinants of emission reduction. Case studies based on typical operation data from a rural region in northern China demonstrate that coordinated electric-thermal DR and carbon trading can achieve maximum carbon-reduction potential. Furthermore, the identified high-sensitivity parameters provide essential theoretical guidance for enhancing the decarbonization potential of RIES."

    "abstract": "In practical applications, the efficacy of a control algorithm relies critically on the accurate knowledge of the parameters and states of the underlying system. However, obtaining these quantities in practice is often challenging. Adaptive observers address this issue by performing simultaneous state and parameter estimation using only input-output measurements. While many adaptive observer designs exist for continuous-time systems, their discrete-time counterparts remain relatively unexplored. This paper proposes an initial excitation (IE)-based adaptive observer for discrete-time linear time-invariant systems. In contrast to conventional designs that rely on the persistence of excitation condition, which requires continuous excitation and infinite control effort, the proposed method does not require excitation for infinite time, thus making it more practical for stabilization tasks. We employ a two-layer filtering structure and a normalized gradient descent-based update law for learning the unknown parameters. We also propose modifying the regressors to enhance information extraction, leading to faster convergence. Rigorous theoretical analysis guarantees bounded and exponentially converging estimates of both states and parameters under the IE condition, and simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed design."

Despite their simplicity, these methods, which lack target specificity, limit players' ability to give complex tactical instructions and hinder immersive gameplay experiences. To address this problem, we propose the FPS AI Companion who Understands Language (F.A.C.U.L.), the first real-time AI system that enables players to communicate and collaborate with AI companions using natural language. By integrating natural language processing with a confidence-based framework, F.A.C.U.L. efficiently decomposes complex commands and interprets player intent. It also employs a dynamic entity retrieval method for environmental awareness, aligning human intentions with decision-making. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, our method supports real-time language interactions, enabling players to issue complex commands such as ``clear the second floor'', ``take cover behind that tree'', or ``retreat to the river''. The system provides real-time behavioral responses and vocal feedback, ensuring seamless tactical collaboration. Using the popular FPS game \\textit{Arena Breakout: Infinite} as a case study, we present comparisons demonstrating the efficacy of our approach and discuss the advantages and limitations of AI companions based on real-world user feedback."

This selective application ensures that local Galerkin operators are computed and stored only where necessary, minimizing memory requirements while maintaining robust convergence. We demonstrate the method on a suite of sinker benchmark problems for the generalized Stokes equation, including grid-aligned and unaligned viscosity jumps, smoothly varying viscosity functions with large gradients, and different viscosity evaluation techniques. We analytically quantify the solver's memory consumption and demonstrate its efficiency by solving Stokes problems with $10^{10}$ degrees of freedom, viscosity jumps of $10^{6}$ magnitude, and more than 100{,}000 parallel processes."

Manual verification of CONSORT adherence is a laborious, time-intensive process that constitutes a significant bottleneck in peer review and evidence synthesis. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the accuracy and reliability of contemporary LLMs in identifying the adherence of published RCTs to the CONSORT 2010 statement under a zero-shot setting. We constructed a golden standard dataset of 150 published RCTs spanning diverse medical specialties. The primary outcome was the macro-averaged F1-score for the three-class classification task, supplemented by item-wise performance metrics and qualitative error analysis. Overall model performance was modest. The top-performing models, Gemini-2.5-Flash and DeepSeek-R1, achieved nearly identical macro F1 scores of 0.634 and Cohen's Kappa coefficients of 0.280 and 0.282, respectively, indicating only fair agreement with expert consensus. A striking performance disparity was observed across classes: while most models could identify compliant items with high accuracy (F1 score > 0.850), they struggled profoundly with identifying non-compliant and not applicable items, where F1 scores rarely exceeded 0.400. Notably, some high-profile models like GPT-4o underperformed, achieving a macro F1-score of only 0.521. LLMs show potential as preliminary screening assistants for CONSORT checks, capably identifying well-reported items. However, their current inability to reliably detect reporting omissions or methodological flaws makes them unsuitable for replacing human expertise in the critical appraisal of trial quality."

A common solution is trajectory-level optimization, which treats each trajectory as a single training sample. However, this approach can be inefficient and yield misleading learning signals: it applies uniform sampling across tasks regardless of difficulty, penalizes correct intermediate actions in failed trajectories, and incurs high sample-collection costs. To address these issues, we propose STEP (Success-rate-aware Trajectory-Efficient Policy optimization), a framework that dynamically allocates sampling based on per-task success rates and performs step-level optimization. STEP maintains a smoothed success-rate record to guide adaptive trajectory resampling, allocating more effort to harder tasks. It then computes success-rate-weighted advantages and decomposes trajectories into step-level samples. Finally, it applies a step-level GRPO augmentation to refine updates for low-success tasks. Experiments on OSWorld and AndroidWorld show that STEP substantially improves sample efficiency and training stability over trajectory-level GRPO, converging faster and generalizing better under the same sampling budget."

The interplay between lattice topology and non-Hermiticity gives rise to both bulk and edge exceptional points (EPs), which govern the charging dynamics. In the topological regime, an edge-state EP emerges at an exponentially small non-Hermitian strength, resulting in early PT-symmetry breaking and rapid energy accumulation. This topological enhancement originates from the PT-symmetric non-Hermitian dynamics, in which the broken-symmetry edge mode with the largest imaginary part of the eigenvalue dominates the time evolution. Consequently, the topological phase consistently yields higher stored energy and faster saturation than the trivial configuration across all parameter regimes and system sizes. These findings demonstrate that topology constitutes a genuine physical resource for enhancing the performance of quantum batteries."

    "abstract": "Early diagnosis of breast cancer is crucial, enabling the establishment of appropriate treatment plans and markedly enhancing patient prognosis. While direct magnetic resonance imaging-guided biopsy demonstrates promising performance in detecting cancer lesions, its practical application is limited by prolonged procedure times and high costs. To overcome these issues, an indirect MRI-guided biopsy that allows the procedure to be performed outside of the MRI room has been proposed, but it still faces challenges in creating an accurate real-time deformable breast model. In our study, we tackled this issue by developing a graph neural network (GNN)-based model capable of accurately predicting deformed breast cancer sites in real time during biopsy procedures. An individual-specific finite element (FE) model was developed by incorporating magnetic resonance (MR) image-derived structural information of the breast and tumor to simulate deformation behaviors. A GNN model was then employed, designed to process surface displacement and distance-based graph data, enabling accurate prediction of overall tissue displacement, including the deformation of the tumor region. The model was validated using phantom and real patient datasets, achieving an accuracy within 0.2 millimeters (mm) for cancer node displacement (RMSE) and a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.977 for spatial overlap with actual cancerous regions. Additionally, the model enabled real-time inference and achieved a speed-up of over 4,000 times in computational cost compared to conventional FE simulations. The proposed deformation-aware GNN model offers a promising solution for real-time tumor displacement prediction in breast biopsy, with high accuracy and real-time capability. Its integration with clinical procedures could significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis."

This ambiguity hinders the effective evaluation and practical utility of explanation methods.We address this gap by introducing the Reference-Frame $\\times$ Granularity (RFxG) taxonomy, a principled conceptual framework that organizes saliency explanations along two essential axes:Reference-Frame: Distinguishing between pointwise (\"Why this prediction?\") and contrastive (\"Why this and not an alternative?\") explanations.Granularity: Ranging from fine-grained class-level (e.g., \"Why Husky?\") to coarse-grained group-level (e.g., \"Why Dog?\") interpretations.Using the RFxG lens, we demonstrate critical limitations in existing evaluation metrics, which overwhelmingly prioritize pointwise faithfulness while neglecting contrastive reasoning and semantic granularity. To systematically assess explanation quality across both RFxG dimensions, we propose four novel faithfulness metrics. Our comprehensive evaluation framework applies these metrics to ten state-of-the-art saliency methods, four model architectures, and three datasets.By advocating a shift toward user-intent-driven evaluation, our work provides both the conceptual foundation and the practical tools necessary to develop visual explanations that are not only faithful to the underlying model behavior but are also meaningfully aligned with the complexity of human understanding and inquiry."

To address these challenges, we seek to leverage the priors learned by visual foundation models on a vast amount of natural images to better tackle this task. Specifically, we propose a novel framework that can effectively transfer knowledge from Segment Anything 2 (SAM2), which is pre-trained on natural images, to the EM domain. We first use SAM2 to extract powerful, general-purpose features. To bridge the domain gap, we introduce a Feature-Guided Attention module that leverages semantic cues from SAM2 to guide a lightweight encoder, the Fine-Grained Encoder (FGE), in focusing on these challenging regions. Finally, a dual-affinity decoder generates both coarse and refined affinity maps. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches with the SAM2 weights frozen. Upon further fine-tuning on EM data, our method significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods. This study validates that transferring representations pre-trained on natural images, when combined with targeted domain-adaptive guidance, can effectively address the specific challenges in neuron segmentation."

We propose MACKO-SpMV, a GPU-optimized format and kernel co-designed to reduce storage overhead while preserving compatibility with the GPU's execution model. This enables efficient SpMV for unstructured sparsity without specialized hardware units (e.g., tensor cores) or format-specific precomputation. Empirical results show that at sparsity 50%, MACKO is the first approach with significant 1.5x memory reduction and 1.2-1.5x speedup over dense representation. Speedups over other SpMV baselines: 2.8-13.0x over cuSPARSE, 1.9-2.6x over Sputnik, and 2.2-2.5x over DASP. Applied to Llama2-7B pruned with Wanda to sparsity 50%, it delivers 1.5x memory reduction and 1.5x faster inference at fp16 precision.

We systematically compare each method by measuring the \"performance loss\" (or gain) relative to a float32 baseline across a full suite of retrieval metrics (NDCG, MAP, MRR, Recall, Precision) at various k cutoffs. Our results show that int8 scalar quantization provides the most effective \"sweet spot,\" achieving a 4x compression with a negligible [~1-2%] drop in nDCG@10. In contrast, Autoencoders show a graceful degradation but suffer a more significant performance loss at equivalent 4x compression ratios (AE-96). binary quantization was found to be unsuitable for this task due to catastrophic performance drops.

    "abstract": "Complex video reasoning remains a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), as current R1-based methodologies often prioritize text-centric reasoning derived from text-based and image-based developments. In video tasks, such strategies frequently underutilize rich visual information, leading to potential shortcut learning and increased susceptibility to hallucination. To foster a more robust, visual-centric video understanding, we start by introducing a novel self-supervised reinforcement learning GRPO algorithm (Pretext-GRPO) within the standard R1 pipeline, in which positive rewards are assigned for correctly solving pretext tasks on transformed visual inputs, which makes the model to non-trivially process the visual information. Building on the effectiveness of Pretext-GRPO, we further propose the ViSS-R1 framework, which streamlines and integrates pretext-task-based self-supervised learning directly into the MLLM's R1 post-training paradigm. Instead of relying solely on sparse visual cues, our framework compels models to reason about transformed visual input by simultaneously processing both pretext questions (concerning transformations) and true user queries. This necessitates identifying the applied transformation and reconstructing the original video to formulate accurate final answers. Comprehensive evaluations on six widely-used video reasoning and understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our Pretext-GRPO and ViSS-R1 for complex video reasoning. Our codes and models will be publicly available."

    "abstract": "Conventional Leptogenesis mechanism, which provides compelling explanation to the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU), assumes the absence of hypermagnetic field in the early universe, thereby disregard the implications of hyper gauge field helicity, that have been thoroughly studied in the magnetogenesis mechanism. In this paper, we address impacts of a general U(1) gauge field on Leptogenesis by deriving equation of motions for the helicity and the energy density of a general magnetic field, to which the chiral magnetic effect (CME) is identified as essential, and studying their effects on the evolution chiral asymmetries. Notably, CME in the $U(1)_{\\mathbf{L}_i-\\mathbf{L}_j}$ framework, where $\\mathbf{L}_{i,j}$ means specific lepton flavor, explicitly breaks the total lepton number and provides an efficient spectator process, that can wash out pre-existing lepton asymmetries. This establishes a natural connection to the wash-in Leptogenesis paradigm. We demonstrate that this spectator effect enables the generation of the BAU, eliminating the need for both an initial $\\mathbf{B}-\\mathbf{L}$ charge and primordial helicity."

We assume that a large amount $M$ of \\textit{unlabeled} data drawn from the sampling distribution $P$ is available, together with a small amount $N$ of labeled data drawn from the same distribution and noisy estimates of the corresponding ground truth entries. This setting is inspired by recommender systems scenarios where the unlabeled data corresponds to `implicit feedback' (consisting in interactions such as purchase, click, etc. ) and the labeled data corresponds to the `explicit feedback', consisting of interactions where the user has given an explicit rating to the item. Leveraging powerful results from the theory of low-rank subspace recovery, together with classic generalization bounds for matrix completion models, we show error bounds consisting of a sum of two error terms scaling as $\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{nd}{M}}\\right)$ and $\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{dr}{N}}\\right)$ respectively, where $d$ is the rank of $P$ and $r$ is the rank of $M$. In synthetic experiments, we confirm that the true generalization error naturally splits into independent error terms corresponding to the estimations of $P$ and and the ground truth matrix $\\ground$ respectively. In real-life experiments on Douban and MovieLens with most explicit ratings removed, we demonstrate that the method can outperform baselines relying only on the explicit ratings, demonstrating that our assumptions provide a valid toy theoretical setting to study the interaction between explicit and implicit feedbacks in recommender systems."

    "abstract": "The growth of suburbs in the US has led to significant sustainability challenges; yet, it remains unclear whether these challenges stem from the remoteness of suburbs from city centers or the specific designs used to develop them. This paper examines how Garden City Design (GCD) -- one of the most influential suburban design paradigms since the early 20th century -- impacts the social and environmental outcomes of neighborhoods. I first introduce a composite measure of GCD, derived from street layouts and block configurations, to quantify its nationwide adoption. I use this measure combined with mobility and emissions data to estimate the impact of GCD on neighborhood outcomes using complementary identification strategies, including ordinary least squares (OLS), matching estimators, and an instrumental variables (IV) approach that exploits historical variation in GCD adoption. Results show that GCD leads to worse sustainability outcomes, including increased greenhouse gas emissions, greater social isolation, and higher sedentary behavior. The prevalence of GCD accounts for 27-38% of the adverse effects associated with suburbanization, underscoring the crucial role that neighborhood design plays in shaping urban sustainability."

In response, numerous fair graph learning methods have been proposed in recent years. However, most of them assume full access to demographic information, a requirement rarely met in practice due to privacy, legal, or regulatory restrictions. To this end, this paper introduces a novel fair graph learning framework that mitigates bias in graph learning under limited demographic information. Specifically, we propose a mechanism guided by partial demographic data to generate proxies for demographic information and design a strategy that enforces consistent node embeddings across demographic groups. In addition, we develop an adaptive confidence strategy that dynamically adjusts each node's contribution to fairness and utility based on prediction confidence. We further provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our framework, FairGLite, achieves provable upper bounds on group fairness metrics, offering formal guarantees for bias mitigation. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and fair graph learning frameworks, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in both mitigating bias and maintaining model utility."

    "abstract": "As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, visual explanation techniques have become essential tools for supporting transparency. In this work, we reveal a new class of attacks that compromise model interpretability without affecting accuracy. Specifically, we show that small color perturbations applied by adversarial clients in a federated learning setting can shift a model's saliency maps away from semantically meaningful regions while keeping the prediction unchanged. The proposed saliency-aware attack framework, called Chromatic Perturbation Module, systematically crafts adversarial examples by altering the color contrast between foreground and background in a way that disrupts explanation fidelity. These perturbations accumulate across training rounds, poisoning the global model's internal feature attributions in a stealthy and persistent manner. Our findings challenge a common assumption in model auditing that correct predictions imply faithful explanations and demonstrate that interpretability itself can be an attack surface. We evaluate this vulnerability across multiple datasets and show that standard training pipelines are insufficient to detect or mitigate explanation degradation, especially in the federated learning setting, where subtle color perturbations are harder to discern. Our attack reduces peak activation overlap in Grad-CAM explanations by up to 35% while preserving classification accuracy above 96% on all evaluated datasets."

We prove that, under local energy relaxation and dephasing noise, MDD achieves the maximum entanglement fidelity attainable by any DD scheme based on bang-bang operations to first order in evolution time. On the IBM Eagle processor, MDD achieved up to a $450$-fold improvement in the success probability of a $14$-qubit quantum Fourier transform, and improved the accuracy of ground-state energy estimation for $N_2$ in the $56$-qubit sample-based quantum diagonalization compared with the standard XX-pulse DD. These results establish MDD as a scalable and effective approach for suppressing decoherence in large-scale quantum algorithms."

    "abstract": "Social anxiety is a prevalent condition that affects interpersonal interactions and social functioning. Recent advances in artificial intelligence and social robotics offer new opportunities to examine social anxiety in the human-robot interaction context. Accurate detection of affective states and behaviours associated with social anxiety requires multimodal datasets, where each signal modality provides complementary insights into its manifestations. However, such datasets remain scarce, limiting progress in both research and applications. To address this, this paper presents a protocol for multimodal dataset collection designed to reflect social anxiety in a human-robot interaction context. The dataset will consist of synchronised audio, video, and physiological recordings acquired from at least 70 participants, grouped according to their level of social anxiety, as they engage in approximately 10-minute interactive Wizard-of-Oz role-play scenarios with the Furhat social robot under controlled experimental conditions. In addition to multimodal data, the dataset will be enriched with contextual data providing deeper insight into individual variability in social anxiety responses. This work can contribute to research on affect-adaptive human-robot interaction by providing support for robust multimodal detection of social anxiety."

We benchmark our method against off-the-shelf nonlinear programming solvers, showing how it can bring computation time down from a few minutes to a few seconds, paving the way for real-time implementations. Moreover, we compare our results to similarly efficient minimum-curvature racing line optimization methods, showing how a minimum-time-based racing line might lead to 4% faster lap-times. Finally, we showcase our framework for optimal powertrain energy management and we validate the common modeling assumption that the racing line is unaffected by energy limitations, showing that this assumption results in marginal lap-time losses of under 0.1%."

We evaluate Naga on multiple long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) benchmarks, including ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2, Weather, Traffic, and ILI. The experimental results show that Naga outperforms 28 current state of the art models and demonstrates improved efficiency compared to existing deep SSM-based approaches.

    "abstract": "Urban villages (UVs), informal settlements embedded within China's urban fabric, have undergone widespread demolition and redevelopment in recent decades. However, there remains a lack of systematic evaluation of whether the demolished land has been effectively reused, raising concerns about the efficacy and sustainability of current redevelopment practices. To address the gap, this study proposes a deep learning-based framework to monitor the spatiotemporal changes of UVs in China. Specifically, semantic segmentation of multi-temporal remote sensing imagery is first used to map evolving UV boundaries, and then post-demolition land use is classified into six categories based on the \"remained-demolished-redeveloped\" phase: incomplete demolition, vacant land, construction sites, buildings, green spaces, and others. Four representative cities from China's four economic regions were selected as the study areas, i.e., Guangzhou (East), Zhengzhou (Central), Xi'an (West), and Harbin (Northeast). The results indicate: 1) UV redevelopment processes were frequently prolonged; 2) redevelopment transitions primarily occurred in peripheral areas, whereas urban cores remained relatively stable; and 3) three spatiotemporal transformation pathways, i.e., synchronized redevelopment, delayed redevelopment, and gradual optimization, were revealed. This study highlights the fragmented, complex and nonlinear nature of UV redevelopment, underscoring the need for tiered and context-sensitive planning strategies. By linking spatial dynamics with the context of redevelopment policies, the findings offer valuable empirical insights that support more inclusive, efficient, and sustainable urban renewal, while also contributing to a broader global understanding of informal settlement transformations."

Although differential privacy (DP) with private voting is a pragmatic mitigation, DP-ICL implementations are error-prone, and worst-case DP bounds may substantially overestimate actual leakage, calling for practical auditing tools. We present a tight and efficient privacy auditing framework for DP-ICL systems that runs membership inference attacks and translates their success rates into empirical privacy guarantees using Gaussian DP. Our analysis of the private voting mechanism identifies vote configurations that maximize the auditing signal, guiding the design of audit queries that reliably reveal whether a canary demonstration is present in the context. The framework supports both black-box (API-only) and white-box (internal vote) threat models, and unifies auditing for classification and generation by reducing both to a binary decision problem. Experiments on standard text classification and generation benchmarks show that our empirical leakage estimates closely match theoretical DP budgets on classification tasks and are consistently lower on generation tasks due to conservative embedding-sensitivity bounds, making our framework a practical privacy auditor and verifier for real-world DP-ICL deployments."

We replace the minimum by its log-sum-exp (soft-min) smoothing and show that, under a strict safety condition, the smooth function becomes a CBF (or extended CBF) for a range of the smoothing parameter. For compact safe sets, we derive an explicit lower bound on the smoothing parameter that makes the smooth function a CBF and hence renders the corresponding safety filter feasible. For unbounded sets, we introduce tail conditions under which the smooth function satisfies an extended CBF condition uniformly. Finally, we apply these results to backup CBFs. We show that safety of a compact (terminal) backup set under a backup controller, together with a condition ensuring safety of the backup trajectories on the relevant boundary of the safe set, is sufficient for feasibility for backup CBFs. These results provide a recipe for a priori feasibility guarantees for smooth inner approximations of nonsmooth safe sets without the need for additional online certification."

The framework coordinates three specialized agents, including a data narration agent, an LLM-as-a-judge agent, and an optional human-in-the-loop evaluator, to iteratively transform analytical artifacts into coherent, stakeholder-oriented reports. The system is validated through a real-world case study on public bus transportation in Northern Jutland, Denmark, where fuel efficiency data from 4006 trips are analyzed using Gaussian Mixture Model clustering. Comparative experiments across five state-of-the-art LLMs and three prompting paradigms identify GPT-4.1 mini with Chain-of-Thought prompting as the optimal configuration, achieving 97.3% narrative accuracy while balancing interpretability and computational cost. The findings demonstrate that multi-agent orchestration significantly enhances factual precision, coherence, and scalability in LLM-based reporting.

We analyze key phenomenological features, demonstrating significant deviations from Schwarzschild in the radii of the photon sphere and the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO). Furthermore, we derive the Regge-Wheeler equation for gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations and compute the black hole shadow, providing a direct comparison with the Schwarzschild metric. Despite being ruled out by solar system tests, the exponential metric remains relevant for theories beyond standard GR, regular black hole models, and its connection to screened Yukawa potentials."

In this paper, we present the first statistical model checking approach for such multi-objective Pareto queries, using lightweight strategy sampling to optimise over the model's nondeterministic choices. We first introduce an incremental scheme that almost surely converges to a statistically sound confidence band bounding the true Pareto front from both sides in the long run. To obtain a close underapproximation of the true front in finite time, we then propose three heuristic approaches that try to make the best of an a-priori fixed sampling budget.

In this work, we propose and study a model of opinion dynamics on $d$-uniform hypergraphs, where individuals interact through group-based (higher-order) structures rather than simple pairwise connections. Each one of the two opinions $A$ and $B$ is characterized by a quality, $Q_A$ and $Q_B$, and agents update their opinions according to a general mechanism that takes into account the weighted fraction of agents supporting either opinion and the pooling error, $α$, a proxy for the information lost during the interaction. Through bifurcation analysis of the mean-field model, we identify two critical thresholds, $α_{\\text{crit}}^{(1)}$ and $α_{\\text{crit}}^{(2)}$, which delimit stability regimes for the consensus states. These analytical predictions are validated through extensive agent-based simulations on both random and scale-free hypergraphs. Moreover, the analytical framework demonstrates that the bifurcation structure and critical thresholds are independent of the underlying topology of the higher-order network, depending solely on the parameters $d$, i.e., the size of the interaction groups, and the quality ratio. Finally, we bring to the fore a nontrivial effect: the large sizes of the interaction groups, could drive the system toward the adoption of the worst option."

    "abstract": "The rise of AI and its growing computational demands have driven the integration of domain-specific accelerators (such as GPUs, TPUs, and NPUs) across the entire computing infrastructure. Following the precedent set by the GPGPU which popularized GPUs for general-purpose tasks, this research asks whether this phenomenon can be replicated with specialized accelerators like NPUs in new contexts. This paper evaluates the potential of the Apple Neural Engine (ANE) designed for high energy efficiency in Machine Learning workloads, in the context of general-purpose HPC applications. We evaluate the performance and energy consumption of classic HPC algorithms such as GEMM, Jacobi or Multigrid methods on Apple's ANE across the M1 and the latest M4 architectures. Results confirm that, when algorithms are properly adapted, the ANE achieves competitive performance (up to 3.8 TFlops on the M4-Pro, comparable to the GPU's 4.7 TFlops on the same SoC for GEMM operation) while demonstrating significantly superior energy efficiency (e.g., GEMM consumes 5.2 Watts on the ANE versus 24 Watts on GPU counterpart in M4 architectures)."

    "abstract": "The Moon-forming giant impact significantly influenced the initial thermal state of Earth's mantle by generating a global magma ocean, marking the onset of mantle evolution. Recent Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations indicate that such a collision would produce a superheated core, whose cooling would strongly influence subsequent mantle dynamics. Here, we present systematic SPH simulations of diverse giant-impact scenarios and show that the superheated core formed after the impact can trigger secondary mantle melting, thereby governing the final state of the magma ocean. To further quantify this effect, we employ a parameterized mantle-melting model to evaluate the influence of secondary melting on the lower mantle. Our results suggest three possible outcomes: complete mantle melting, the formation of a basal melt layer, or the initiation of an early superplume. Combined with recent two-phase magma-ocean solidification models, we infer that all three scenarios would result in basal melt layers of varying thickness, partially retaining the thermal energy of the superheated core. In the canonical Moon-forming scenario, the superheated core would rapidly transfer heat to Earth's lower mantle, causing secondary mantle melting within approximately 277--5983 years and generating either a basal melt layer or a fully molten mantle. Both outcomes would effectively erase primordial heterogeneities in the lower mantle and impose distinct pathways for its subsequent thermal evolution."

Spin relaxation is indeed a major limiting factor for both the efficiency and storage time of quantum memory protocols based on atomic frequency combs in rare-earth materials. The relaxation dynamics among the four ground-state hyperfine levels were simultaneously investigated by optically perturbing the spin population distribution and monitoring its return to thermal equilibrium through optical absorption spectroscopy. By applying different types of perturbations, we were also able to distinguish between two types of relaxation processes, induced by spin-phonon and spin-spin interactions. Below 1 K, we observed that the re-thermalization of the Yb$^{3+}$ ion population takes several hours, driven solely by direct phonon absorption or emission. However, the effective lifetime of individual spin states is much shorter - on the order of several seconds in low-doped (2 ppm) samples and of milliseconds in 10 ppm samples - due to spin-spin interactions. These findings provide valuable guidelines for optimizing doping levels and operating temperatures in rare-earth-doped crystals for quantum applications. Notably, they suggest that atomic frequency combs with lifetimes of several hours could be realized using $^{171}$Yb:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystals with slightly less than 2 ppm doping and operating near 1 K."

Using connected simulated annealing we generate low-energy graph configurations and characterize their emergent geometry through the spectral dimension (ds), the Hausdorff dimension (dh), and the average distance. Finite-size scaling shows a clear growth of ds with system size, while dh increases more mildly. At the largest volumes explored the data are compatible with ds ~ 4 and dh ~ 3, implying ds > dh and a nontrivial hierarchy between spectral and volumetric notions of dimension. We also map the dependence on the curvature coupling gamma and the locality coupling beta, and we find a slow power-law growth of typical distances with a small exponent eta. The CCM therefore provides a controlled numerical laboratory in which the interplay of coherence, curvature, and locality yields finite-dimensional, fractal-like geometries."

We study the degree to which such extensions are unique up to the boundary. Firstly, we find that in general not even the $C^0$-structure of the extension is uniquely determined by the assumption that the metric extends continuously. However, we exhibit an interesting local-global relation regarding the $C^0$-structure which in particular entails its rigidity for ''strongly spherically symmetric'' continuous extensions across the Cauchy horizon of the Reissner-Nordström spacetime. Secondly, we construct continuous extensions which have the same $C^0$-structure, but do not have equivalent $C^1$-structures. This construction also carries over to weak null singularities in 3+1 dimensions. Understanding the uniqueness properties of continuous spacetime extensions to the boundary is of importance for the study of low-regularity inextendibility problems."

    "abstract": "Traffic time series imputation is crucial for the safety and reliability of intelligent transportation systems, while diverse types of missing data, including random, fiber, and block missing make the imputation task challenging. Existing models often focus on disentangling and separately modeling spatial and temporal patterns based on relationships between data points. However, these approaches struggle to adapt to the random missing positions, and fail to learn long-term and large-scale dependencies, which are essential in extensive missing conditions. In this paper, patterns are categorized into two types to handle various missing data conditions: primary patterns, which originate from internal relationships between data points, and auxiliary patterns, influenced by external factors like timestamps and node attributes. Accordingly, we propose the Primary-Auxiliary Spatio-Temporal network (PAST). It comprises a graph-integrated module (GIM) and a cross-gated module (CGM). GIM captures primary patterns via dynamic graphs with interval-aware dropout and multi-order convolutions, and CGM extracts auxiliary patterns through bidirectional gating on embedded external features. The two modules interact via shared hidden vectors and are trained under an ensemble self-supervised framework. Experiments on three datasets under 27 missing data conditions demonstrate that the imputation accuracy of PAST outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines by up to 26.2% in RMSE and 31.6% in MAE."

These frequency shifts ($δν$) were determined using a cross-correlation method and using the individual mode frequencies, obtained by fitting power spectra. Three stars were found to exhibit $δν$ larger than their associated errors ($σ_{δν}$) using both methods, while two more stars exhibited $δν>σ_{δν}$ when the cross correlation was used and a further two stars exhibited $δν>σ_{δν}$ when the fitted frequencies were used. When considering the whole sample of 20 stars, the amplitude of $δν$ showed no dependence on the large frequency separation and metallicity. However, $δν$ was observed to increase with rotation rate and effective temperature. Our sample contained a number of evolved subgiant stars, allowing us to expand the parameter space usually considered when comparing $δν$ with stellar parameters. While $δν$ was small for all of the evolved stars, one was found to have $δν>σ_{δν}$, raising the possibility that these evolved stars may still exhibit variable magnetic activity."

Constraints from type Ia Supernovae (Pantheon+SH0ES) and H(z) data indicate $β\\simeq 0.13$, suggesting a mild departure from standard cosmology and possible relief of the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. The resulting classical cosmology evolves smoothly between two extreme de Sitter phases, offering a singularity-free, unified scenario that beyond solving old cosmological puzzles opens a new perspective to handle the tensions plaguing the current cosmic concordance model."

    "abstract": "Improving energy efficiency in industrial foundry processes is a critical challenge, as these operations are highly energy-intensive and marked by complex interdependencies among process variables. Correlation-based analyses often fail to distinguish true causal drivers from spurious associations, limiting their usefulness for decision-making. This paper applies a time-series causal inference framework to identify the operational factors that directly affect energy efficiency in induction furnace melting. Using production data from a Danish foundry, the study integrates time-series clustering to segment melting cycles into distinct operational modes with the PCMCI+ algorithm, a state-of-the-art causal discovery method, to uncover cause-effect relationships within each mode. Across clusters, robust causal relations among energy consumption, furnace temperature, and material weight define the core drivers of efficiency, while voltage consistently influences cooling water temperature with a delayed response. Cluster-specific differences further distinguish operational regimes: efficient clusters are characterized by stable causal structures, whereas inefficient ones exhibit reinforcing feedback loops and atypical dependencies. The contributions of this study are twofold. First, it introduces an integrated clustering-causal inference pipeline as a methodological innovation for analyzing energy-intensive processes. Second, it provides actionable insights that enable foundry operators to optimize performance, reduce energy consumption, and lower emissions."

We show that the low-energy spectrum exhibits random-matrix statistics, in striking contrast to the Bohigas--Giannoni--Schmit conjecture, where chaotic behavior typically emerges at high energy. For two bosons, the odd-parity sector remains integrable, whereas the even-parity sector displays clear signatures of chaos at low energy and a crossover back to quasi-integrable behavior at higher energies. For three bosons, both parity sectors exhibit spectral statistics close to chaos at low energy. We argue that this unconventional form of many-body quantum chaos originates from diffractive processes induced by the impurity."

It develops an integrated analytical framework combining econometrics, machine learning, and behavioural modelling. CBDC adoption probabilities are estimated using XGBoost and logistic regression models trained on behavioural and macro-financial indicators rather than survey data. Liquidity stress simulations assess how banks would respond to deposit withdrawals resulting from CBDC adoption, while VAR, MSVAR, and SVAR models capture the macro-financial transmission of liquidity shocks into credit contraction and changes in monetary conditions. The findings indicate that CBDC uptake (co-circulating Digital RON and Digital EUR) would be moderate at issuance, amounting to around EUR 1 billion, primarily driven by digital readiness and trust in the central bank. The study concludes that a non-remunerated, capped CBDC, designed primarily as a means of payment rather than a store of value, can be introduced without compromising financial stability. In dual currency economies, differentiated holding limits for domestic and foreign digital currencies (e.g., Digital RON versus Digital Euro) are crucial to prevent uncontrolled euroisation and preserve monetary sovereignty. A prudent design with moderate caps, non remuneration, and macroprudential coordination can transform CBDC into a digital liquidity buffer and a complementary monetary policy instrument that enhances resilience and inclusion rather than destabilising the financial system."

The global neutral hydrogen fraction (x_HI) is a key observable for probing this era. This paper presents a novel, statistically robust method to extract the evolution of x_HI from the challenging noise-dominated data from the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Data Challenge 3b. Our approach is based on a key physical insight: the pixel value distribution in SKA intensity maps is a mixture of signals from ionized and neutral regions. We model this distribution as a superposition of two Gaussian components-one fixed at zero representing noise and ionized bubbles, and a second, offset Gaussian tracing the neutral hydrogen signal. We perform this decomposition on data grouped into three redshift bins. The double-Gaussian model provides an excellent fit to the pixel histogram data. The derived x_HI values show a clear decreasing trend across the three redshift bins, consistent with a progressing reionization process. And the results are consistent with the provided simulation data. This method offers a powerful, model-independent, and fully interpretable way for measuring x_HI from 21 cm data, demonstrating significant potential for application to future SKA observations."

However, most tools classify only overall image quality, without indicating acquisition defects to guide recapture. This gap is mainly due to the high cost of detailed annotations. In this paper, we aim to mitigate this limitation by introducing a hybrid semi-supervised learning approach that combines manual labels for overall quality with pseudo-labels of quality details within a multi-task framework. Our objective is to obtain more interpretable RIQA models without requiring extensive manual labeling. Pseudo-labels are generated by a Teacher model trained on a small dataset and then used to fine-tune a pre-trained model in a multi-task setting. Using a ResNet-18 backbone, we show that these weak annotations improve quality assessment over single-task baselines (F1: 0.875 vs. 0.863 on EyeQ, and 0.778 vs. 0.763 on DeepDRiD), matching or surpassing existing methods. The multi-task model achieved performance statistically comparable to the Teacher for most detail prediction tasks (p > 0.05). In a newly annotated EyeQ subset released with this paper, our model performed similarly to experts, suggesting that pseudo-label noise aligns with expert variability. Our main finding is that the proposed semi-supervised approach not only improves overall quality assessment but also provides interpretable feedback on capture conditions (illumination, clarity, contrast). This enhances interpretability at no extra manual labeling cost and offers clinically actionable outputs to guide image recapture."

These exact recurrences were found to be independent of $k_θ$. The long-time-averaged entanglement and fidelity rate function show dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) for $k_r = jπ/2$ at time-reversal symmetric cases $k_θ= \\pm k_r$. In the other time-reversal symmetric case $k_θ= 0$, the DQPT exists only for a half-odd integer $j$. Using level statistics, a smooth transition is observed from integrable to non-integrable nature as $k_r$ is changed away from $jπ/2$.

We develop three novel Kendall's tau-based approaches for initialization tailored to discrete margins in the low-count regime and embed it within an inference functions for margins (IFM) inspired start. We present three practical initializers (exact, low-intensity approximation, and a transformation-based approach) that substantially reduce the number of ML iterations and improve convergence. For the ML stage, we use an unconstrained reparameterization of the model's parameters using the log and spherical-Cholesky and compute exact rectangle probabilities. Analytical score functions are supplied throughout to stabilize Newton-type optimization. A simulation study across dimensions, dependence levels, and intensity regimes shows that the proposed initialization combined with exact ML achieves lower root-mean-squared error, lower bias and faster computation times than the alternative procedures. The methodology provides a pragmatic path to retain the statistical guarantees of ML (consistency, asymptotic normality, efficiency under correct specification) while remaining tractable for moderate- to high-dimensional discrete data. We conclude with guidance on initializer choice and discuss extensions to alternative correlation structures and different margins."

Practitioners often rely on sophisticated, proprietary heuristics to navigate these issues. Among recent advancements, Agnostic Risk Parity introduces eigenrisk parity (ERP), an innovative approach that leverages isotropy to evenly allocate risk across eigenmodes, enhancing portfolio stability. In this paper, we review and extend the isotropy-enforced philosophy of ERP proposing a versatile framework that integrates mean-variance optimization with an isotropy constraint acting as a geometric regularizer against signal uncertainty. The resulting allocations decompose naturally into canonical portfolios, smoothly interpolating between full isotropy (closed-form isotropic-mean allocation) and pure mean-variance through a tunable isotropy penalty. Beyond methodology, we revisit fundamental concepts and clarify foundational links between isotropy, canonical portfolios, principal portfolios, primal versus dual representations, and intrinsic basis-invariant metrics for returns, risk, and isotropy. Applied to sector trend-following, the isotropy constraint systematically induces negative average-signal exposure -- a structural, parameter-robust crash hedge. This work offers both a practical, theoretically grounded tool for resilient allocation under signal uncertainty and a pedagogical synthesis of modern portfolio concepts."

    "abstract": "Creating offensive advantages during open play is fundamental to football success. However, due to the highly dynamic and long-sequence nature of open play, the potential tactic space grows exponentially as the sequence progresses, making automated tactic discovery extremely challenging. To address this, we propose TacEleven, a generative framework for football open-play tactic discovery developed in close collaboration with domain experts from AJ Auxerre, designed to assist coaches and analysts in tactical decision-making. TacEleven consists of two core components: a language-controlled tactical generator that produces diverse tactical proposals, and a multimodal large language model-based tactical critic that selects the optimal proposal aligned with a high-level stylistic tactical instruction. The two components enables rapid exploration of tactical proposals and discovery of alternative open-play offensive tactics. We evaluate TacEleven across three tasks with progressive tactical complexity: counterfactual exploration, single-step discovery, and multi-step discovery, through both quantitative metrics and a questionnaire-based qualitative assessment. The results show that the TacEleven-discovered tactics exhibit strong realism and tactical creativity, with 52.50% of the multi-step tactical alternatives rated adoptable in real-world elite football scenarios, highlighting the framework's ability to rapidly generate numerous high-quality tactics for complex long-sequence open-play situations. TacEleven demonstrates the potential of creatively leveraging domain data and generative models to advance tactical analysis in sports."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a Bi-fidelity Asymptotic-Preserving Neural Network (BI-APNNs) framework, designed to efficiently solve forward and inverse problems for the semiconductor Boltzmann equation. Our approach builds upon the Asymptotic-Preserving Neural Network (APNNs) methodology \\cite{APNN-transport}, which employs a micro-macro decomposition to handle the model's multiscale nature. We specifically address a key bottleneck in the original APNNs: the slow convergence of the macroscopic density $ρ$ in the near fluid-dynamic regime, i.e., for small Knudsen numbers $\\varepsilon$. The core innovation of BI-APNNs is a novel bi-fidelity decomposition of the macroscopic quantity $ρ$, which accurately approximates the true density at small $\\varepsilon$, and can be efficiently pre-trained. A separate and more compact neural network is then tasked with learning only the minor correction term, $ρ_{\\text{corr}}$. This strategy not only significantly {\\it accelerates} the training convergence but also improves the accuracy of the forward problem solution, particularly in the challenging fluid-dynamic limit. Meanwhile, we demonstrate through extensive numerical experiments that our new BI-APNNs yields substantially more accurate and robust results for inverse problems compared to the standard APNNs. Validated on both the semiconductor Boltzmann and the Boltzmann-Poisson systems, our work shows that the bi-fidelity formulation is a powerful enhancement for tackling multiscale kinetic equations, especially when dealing with inverse problems constrained by partial observation data."

However, prompts sent to cloud-hosted models can contain personally identifiable information (PII) that users do not want logged, retained, or leaked. We observe this to be especially acute when users discuss friends, coworkers, or adversaries, i.e., when they spill the tea. Enterprises face the same challenge when they want to use LLMs for internal communication and decision-making. In this whitepaper, we present Whistledown, a best-effort privacy layer that modifies prompts before they are sent to the LLM. Whistledown combines pseudonymization and $ε$-local differential privacy ($ε$-LDP) with transformation caching to provide best-effort privacy protection without sacrificing conversational utility. Whistledown is designed to have low compute and memory overhead, allowing it to be deployed directly on a client's device in the case of individual users. For enterprise users, Whistledown is deployed centrally within a zero-trust gateway that runs on an enterprise's trusted infrastructure. Whistledown requires no changes to the existing APIs of popular LLM providers."

While autoregressive models exhibited promising data-scaling efficiency in planning tasks, predicting ego trajectories alone suffers sparse supervision and weakly constrains how scene evolution should shape ego motion. Therefore, we introduce DAP, a discrete-token autoregressive planner that jointly forecasts BEV semantics and ego trajectories, thereby enforcing comprehensive representation learning and allowing predicted dynamics to directly condition ego motion. In addition, we incorporate a reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning, which preserves supervised behavior cloning priors while injecting reward-guided improvements. Despite a compact 160M parameter budget, DAP achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-loop metrics and delivers competitive closed-loop results on the NAVSIM benchmark. Overall, the fully discrete-token autoregressive formulation operating on both rasterized BEV and ego actions provides a compact yet scalable planning paradigm for autonomous driving."

    "abstract": "Collaborative Filtering~(CF) plays a crucial role in modern recommender systems, leveraging historical user-item interactions to provide personalized suggestions. However, CF-based methods often encounter biases due to imbalances in training data. This phenomenon makes CF-based methods tend to prioritize recommending popular items and performing unsatisfactorily on inactive users. Existing works address this issue by rebalancing training samples, reranking recommendation results, or making the modeling process robust to the bias. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches can compromise accuracy or be sensitive to weighting strategies, making them challenging to train. In this paper, we deeply analyze the causes and effects of the biases and propose a framework to alleviate biases in recommendation from the perspective of representation distribution, namely Group-Alignment and Global-Uniformity Enhanced Representation Learning for Debiasing Recommendation (AURL). Specifically, we identify two significant problems in the representation distribution of users and items, namely group-discrepancy and global-collapse. These two problems directly lead to biases in the recommendation results. To this end, we propose two simple but effective regularizers in the representation space, respectively named group-alignment and global-uniformity. The goal of group-alignment is to bring the representation distribution of long-tail entities closer to that of popular entities, while global-uniformity aims to preserve the information of entities as much as possible by evenly distributing representations. Our method directly optimizes both the group-alignment and global-uniformity regularization terms to mitigate recommendation biases. Extensive experiments on three real datasets and various recommendation backbones verify the superiority of our proposed framework."

However, its extension to low-resource languages remains limited due to the scarcity of high-quality multilingual image-text data. Existing multilingual vision-language models exhibit consistently low retrieval performance in underrepresented languages including Czech, Finnish, Croatian, Hungarian, and Romanian on the Crossmodal-3600 (XM3600) benchmark. To address this, we propose a lightweight and data-efficient framework for multilingual vision-language alignment. Our approach requires no image-text pairs or text-text pairs and freezes both the pretrained image encoder and multilingual text encoder during training. Only a compact 1.7M-parameter projection module is trained, using a contrastive loss over English representations as semantic anchors. This minimal training setup enables robust multilingual alignment even for languages with limited supervision. Extensive evaluation across multiple multilingual retrieval benchmarks confirms the effectiveness of our method, showing significant gains in five underrepresented languages where existing models typically underperform. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our pivot-based, parameter-efficient alignment strategy for inclusive multimodal learning."

Our key insight is that these 3D reconstruction models serve as visual-geometry foundation models, inherently encoding rich geometric knowledge of real scenes. To leverage this, we design a Light-Geometry Dual-Branch Encoder that extracts both multi-illumination cues and geometric priors from the frozen 3D reconstruction model. We also address the limitations of the conventional orthographic projection assumption by introducing the PS-Perp dataset with realistic perspective projection to enable learning of spatially varying view directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoUniPS delivers state-of-the-arts performance across multiple datasets, both quantitatively and qualitatively, especially in the complex in-the-wild scenes."

To maximize the sum communication rate while satisfying the total sensing mutual information (MI) requirement, we jointly optimize the UAV trajectories, communication and sensing power allocation, and the dynamic time-division ratio. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is efficiently solved using an alternating optimization (AO) framework. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed joint design significantly outperforms benchmark schemes with static or partially optimized resources. The findings also reveal the critical importance of dynamic trajectory and resource management for effectively navigating the sensing-communication trade-off, especially under stringent power or sensing constraints."

Unlike text-only methods lacking spatial awareness, Medal S achieves channel-wise alignment between volumetric prompts and text embeddings, mitigating inaccuracies from resolution mismatches. By preserving full 3D context, it efficiently processes multiple native-resolution masks in parallel, enhancing multi-class segmentation performance. A lightweight 3D convolutional module enables precise voxel-space refinement guided by both prompt types, supporting up to 243 classes across CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and microscopy modalities in the BiomedSegFM dataset. Medal S offers two prompting modes: a text-only mode, where model predictions serve as spatial prompts for self-refinement without human input, and a hybrid mode, incorporating manual annotations for enhanced flexibility. For 24-class segmentation, parallel spatial prompting reduces inference time by more than 90% compared to sequential prompting. We propose dynamic resampling to address target-patch ratio imbalance, extending SAT and nnU-Net for data augmentation. Furthermore, we develop optimized text preprocessing, a two-stage inference strategy, and post-processing techniques to improve memory efficiency, precision, and inference speed. On the five-modality average on the validation set, Medal S outperforms SAT with a DSC of 75.44 (vs. 69.83), NSD of 77.34 (vs. 71.06), F1 of 38.24 (vs. 24.88), and DSC TP of 65.46 (vs. 46.97). Medal S achieves excellent performance by harmonizing spatial precision with semantic textual guidance, demonstrating superior efficiency and accuracy in multi-class medical segmentation tasks compared to sequential prompt-based approaches.

APSP builds upon existing Bayesian data borrowing frameworks, incorporating data-driven adaptive information selection, structure of mixture shrinkage informative priors and decision making with empirical null to enhance variable selection performances under small sample size. Extensive simulations show that APSP attains better efficiency relative to traditional and popular data-borrowing and Bayesian variable-selection methods while maintaining robustness under linear relationships. We further applied APSP to identify variables associated with peak C-peptide at Day 75 from the Clinical Islet Transplantation (CIT) Consortium study CIT06 by borrowing information from the study CIT07."

However, most existing 3D assets in simulation are rigid, and manually converting them into articulated objects is extremely labor- and cost-intensive. This raises a natural question: can we automatically identify articulable objects in a scene and convert them into articulated assets directly? In this paper, we present ArtiWorld, a scene-aware pipeline that localizes candidate articulable objects from textual scene descriptions and reconstructs executable URDF models that preserve the original geometry. At the core of this pipeline is Arti4URDF, which leverages 3D point cloud, prior knowledge of a large language model (LLM), and a URDF-oriented prompt design to rapidly convert rigid objects into interactive URDF-based articulated objects while maintaining their 3D shape. We evaluate ArtiWorld at three levels: 3D simulated objects, full 3D simulated scenes, and real-world scan scenes. Across all three settings, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance, while preserving object geometry and correctly capturing object interactivity to produce usable URDF-based articulated models. This provides a practical path toward building interactive, robot-ready simulation environments directly from existing 3D assets. Code and data will be released."

However, prevalent code reuse and limited open-source contributions have introduced significant challenges to the blockchain ecosystem, including plagiarism and the propagation of vulnerable code. Consequently, an effective and accurate similarity detection method for EVM bytecode is urgently needed to identify similar contracts. Traditional binary similarity detection methods are typically based on instruction stream or control flow graph (CFG), which have limitations on EVM bytecode due to specific features like low-level EVM bytecode and heavily-reused basic blocks. Moreover, the highly-diverse Solidity Compiler (Solc) versions further complicate accurate similarity detection. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel EVM bytecode representation called Stable-Semantic Graph (SSG), which captures relationships between 'stable instructions' (special instructions identified by our study). Moreover, we implement a prototype, Esim, which embeds SSG into matrices for similarity detection using a heterogeneous graph neural network. Esim demonstrates high accuracy in SSG construction, achieving F1-scores of 100% for control flow and 95.16% for data flow, and its similarity detection performance reaches 96.3% AUC, surpassing traditional approaches. Our large-scale study, analyzing 2,675,573 smart contracts on six EVM-compatible chains over a one-year period, also demonstrates that Esim outperforms the SOTA tool Etherscan in vulnerability search."

To overcome these limitations, we propose HiFusion, a novel deep learning framework that integrates two complementary components. First, we introduce the Hierarchical Intra-Spot Modeling module that extracts fine-grained morphological representations through multi-resolution sub-patch decomposition, guided by a feature alignment loss to ensure semantic consistency across scales. Concurrently, we present the Context-aware Cross-scale Fusion module, which employs cross-attention to selectively incorporate biologically relevant regional context, thereby enhancing representational capacity.

We present ENGRAM, a lightweight memory system that organizes conversation into three canonical memory types (episodic, semantic, and procedural) through a single router and retriever. Each user turn is converted into typed memory records with normalized schemas and embeddings and stored in a database. At query time, the system retrieves top-k dense neighbors for each type, merges results with simple set operations, and provides the most relevant evidence as context to the model. ENGRAM attains state-of-the-art results on LoCoMo, a multi-session conversational QA benchmark for long-horizon memory, and exceeds the full-context baseline by 15 points on LongMemEval while using only about 1% of the tokens.

However, real physical systems always interact with their surroundings, which causes decoherence. In case of time dependent analysis of non-leptonic neutral $B$ meson decays, this decoherence can be modeled using a single parameter, $λ$. Since decoherence can affect the observed dynamics of flavor oscillations and CP violation, it becomes essential to revisit the key SM parameters such as the CKM angles $(α, β, γ)$ and the mass differences of neutral $B$ mesons ($Δm_{d,s}$). In this work, we study the CKM phase $β$ as well as the penguin contributions in the $B_d^0 \\to J/ψK_S$ decay mode in the presence of decoherence. We employ the pseudo-experiment (Toy Monte-Carlo) technique and perform an $SU(3)_F$ analysis using the $B_d^0 \\to J/ψπ^0$ process.

Existing analyses have focused on local constant estimators and given samples, leaving the principles of transferring knowledge from auxiliary sources across heterogeneous time-varying domains insufficiently established. We derive uniform convergence for multivariate locally linear estimators under strong mixing. The resulting error expansion decomposes stochastic variation, smoothing bias, and a term induced by local stationarity. This additional term, originating from the locally stationary structure, has smaller order than in the Nadaraya-Watson benchmark, explaining the improved local linear performance. Building on these results, we propose bias-corrected transfer learned estimators that connect a sparsely observed series with densely observed related sources through a smoothly varying bias function defined over rescaled time and covariates. An additional refinement shows how local temporal adjustment of this bias enhances stability and enables efficient information borrowing across domains. Simulation studies and an empirical analysis of international fuel prices support the theoretical predictions and demonstrate the practical advantages of transfer learning."

However, such models, usually with local full attention, lack effective memory compression and retrieval for long-term generation beyond the window size, leading to issues of forgetting and spatiotemporal inconsistencies. To enhance the retention of historical information within a fixed memory budget, we introduce a recurrent neural network (RNN) into the diffusion transformer framework. Specifically, a diffusion model incorporating LSTM with attention achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art RNN blocks, such as TTT and Mamba2. Moreover, existing diffusion-RNN approaches often suffer from performance degradation due to training-inference gap or the lack of overlap across windows. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Recurrent Autoregressive Diffusion (RAD) framework, which executes frame-wise autoregression for memory update and retrieval, consistently across training and inference time. Experiments on Memory Maze and Minecraft datasets demonstrate the superiority of RAD for long video generation, highlighting the efficiency of LSTM in sequence modeling."

However, existing item tokenization methods typically require training separate models for each item domain, limiting generalization. Moreover, the diverse distributions and semantics across item domains make it difficult to construct a unified tokenization that preserves domain-specific information. To address these challenges, we propose UniTok, a Unified item Tokenization framework that integrates our own mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with a series of codebooks to convert items into discrete tokens, enabling scalable tokenization while preserving semantic information across multiple item domains. Specifically, items from different domains are first projected into a unified latent space through a shared encoder. They are then routed to domain-specific experts to capture the unique semantics, while a shared expert, which is always active, encodes common knowledge transferable across domains. Additionally, to mitigate semantic imbalance across domains, we present a mutual information calibration mechanism, which guides the model towards retaining similar levels of semantic information for each domain. Comprehensive experiments on wide-ranging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed UniTok framework is (a) highly effective: achieving up to 51.89% improvements over strong benchmarks, (b) theoretically sound: showing the analytical validity of our architectural design and optimization; and (c) highly generalizable: demonstrating robust performance across diverse domains without requiring per-domain retraining, a capability not supported by existing baselines."

Through a systematic algorithm audit of 1,508 real baby care and pregnancy-related queries, we evaluate the quality and consistency of these information displays. Our robust evaluation framework assesses multiple quality dimensions, including answer consistency, relevance, presence of medical safeguards, source categories, and sentiment alignment. Our results reveal concerning gaps in information consistency, with information in AIO and FS displayed on the same search result page being inconsistent with each other in 33% of cases. Despite high relevance scores, both features critically lack medical safeguards (present in just 11% of AIO and 7% of FS responses). While health and wellness websites dominate source categories for both, AIO and FS, FS also often link to commercial sources. These findings have important implications for public health information access and demonstrate the need for stronger quality controls in AI-mediated health information. Our methodology provides a transferable framework for auditing AI systems across high-stakes domains where information quality directly impacts user well-being."

    "abstract": "Transferring the depth-based end-to-end policy trained in simulation to physical robots can yield an efficient and robust grasping policy, yet sensor artifacts in real depth maps like voids and noise establish a significant sim2real gap that critically impedes policy transfer. Training-time strategies like procedural noise injection or learned mappings suffer from data inefficiency due to unrealistic noise simulation, which is often ineffective for grasping tasks that require fine manipulation or dependency on paired datasets heavily. Furthermore, leveraging foundation models to reduce the sim2real gap via intermediate representations fails to mitigate the domain shift fully and adds computational overhead during deployment. This work confronts dual challenges of data inefficiency and deployment complexity. We propose DiffuDepGrasp, a deploy-efficient sim2real framework enabling zero-shot transfer through simulation-exclusive policy training. Its core innovation, the Diffusion Depth Generator, synthesizes geometrically pristine simulation depth with learned sensor-realistic noise via two synergistic modules. The first Diffusion Depth Module leverages temporal geometric priors to enable sample-efficient training of a conditional diffusion model that captures complex sensor noise distributions, while the second Noise Grafting Module preserves metric accuracy during perceptual artifact injection. With only raw depth inputs during deployment, DiffuDepGrasp eliminates computational overhead and achieves a 95.7% average success rate on 12-object grasping with zero-shot transfer and strong generalization to unseen objects.Project website: https://diffudepgrasp.github.io/."

Namely, when ChatGPT generates a task decomposition, ChatHTN learns from it, akin to memoization. However, unlike memoization, it learns a generalized method that applies not only to the specific instance encountered, but to other instances of the same task. We conduct experiments on two domains and demonstrate that our online learning procedure reduces the number of calls to ChatGPT while solving at least as many problems, and in some cases, even more."

However, comparatively few studies have considered the other side of the filter bubble; its protective benefits, particularly to marginalized communities and those living in countries with low levels of press freedom.

Using vCoT, we systematically compare image-only LVLMs with their video-finetuned counterparts, both with and without access to these transitional cues. Our experiments show that vCoT significantly improves the performance of image-only models on long-form video question answering, while yielding only marginal gains for video-finetuned models. This suggests that the latter already capture frame-to-frame transitions implicitly. Moreover, we find that video models transfer this temporal reasoning ability to purely static settings, outperforming image models' baselines on relational visual reasoning tasks."

Moreover, affine isoperimetric inequalities for chord power integrals are derived, that are significantly stronger than their Euclidean counterparts. Extending the framework to functional and affine settings, functional extensions of chord power integrals and radial mean bodies are introduced.

Comparative experiments demonstrate that DDQN outperforms traditional rigid and dynamic strategies, particularly in large-scale or highly uncertain environments, exhibiting superior computational capability, policy reliability, and adaptability. Ablation studies further reveal that the dual-network architecture mitigates overestimation of action values, while the target network substantially improves training convergence and robustness.

    "abstract": "Rigorous valuation of individual data sources is critical for fair compensation in data markets, informed data acquisition, and transparent development of ML/AI models. Classical Data Shapley (DS) provides a essential axiomatic framework for data valuation but is constrained by its symmetry axiom that assumes interchangeability of data sources. This assumption fails to capture the directional and temporal dependencies prevalent in modern ML/AI workflows, including the reliance of duplicated or augmented data on original sources and the order-specific contributions in sequential pipelines such as federated learning and multi-stage LLM fine tuning. To address these limitations, we introduce Asymmetric Data Shapley (ADS), a structure-aware data valuation framework for modern ML/AI pipelines. ADS relaxes symmetry by averaging marginal contributions only over permutations consistent with an application-specific ordering of data groups. It preserves efficiency and linearity, maintains within group symmetry and directional precedence across groups, and reduces to DS when the ordering collapses to a single group. We develop two complementary computational procedures for ADS: (i) a Monte Carlo estimator (MC-ADS) with finite-sample accuracy guarantees, and (ii) a k-nearest neighbor surrogate (KNN-ADS) that is exact and efficient for KNN predictors. Across representative settings with directional and temporal dependence, ADS consistently outperforms benchmark methods by distinguishing novel from redundant contributions and respecting the sequential nature of training. These results establish ADS as a principled and practical approach to equitable data valuation in data markets and complex ML/AI pipelines."

A. Konoplya, A. Zhidenko, arXiv:2511.03066]. The metric is asymptotically flat and characterized by a simple lapse function $f(r)=1-2 M r^{2}/(r+a)^{3}$, where $M$ is the ADM mass and $a$ represents the characteristic scale of the surrounding dark-matter halo that regularizes the central region. The effective potentials for all perturbing fields possess the standard single-barrier form, ensuring linear stability and the applicability of the WKB formalism. The quasinormal frequencies are computed using the sixth- and ninth-order WKB methods with Padé corrections and verified by time-domain integration, both approaches showing excellent agreement. The parameter $a$ leads to a moderate increase in the real oscillation frequency, while the damping rate remains almost unchanged, producing only small corrections to the Schwarzschild spectrum. Since such deviations become appreciable only for unrealistically dense halos, our results confirm that the quasinormal spectrum of astrophysical black holes is safely unaffected by ordinary galactic dark-matter environments."

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks achieve state of the art performance but remain difficult to interpret mechanistically. In this work, we propose a control theoretic framework that treats a trained neural network as a nonlinear state space system and uses local linearization, controllability and observability Gramians, and Hankel singular values to analyze its internal computation. For a given input, we linearize the network around the corresponding hidden activation pattern and construct a state space model whose state consists of hidden neuron activations. The input state and state output Jacobians define local controllability and observability Gramians, from which we compute Hankel singular values and associated modes. These quantities provide a principled notion of neuron and pathway importance: controllability measures how easily each neuron can be excited by input perturbations, observability measures how strongly each neuron influences the output, and Hankel singular values rank internal modes that carry input output energy. We illustrate the framework on simple feedforward networks, including a 1 2 2 1 SwiGLU network and a 2 3 3 2 GELU network. By comparing different operating points, we show how activation saturation reduces controllability, shrinks the dominant Hankel singular value, and shifts the dominant internal mode to a different subset of neurons. The proposed method turns a neural network into a collection of local white box dynamical models and suggests which internal directions are natural candidates for pruning or constraints to improve interpretability."

    "abstract": "Leaving posterior sensitivity concerns aside, non-identifiability of the parameters does not raise a difficulty for Bayesian inference as far as the posterior is proper, but multi-modality or flat regions of the posterior induced by the lack of identification leaves a challenge for modern Bayesian computation. Sampling methods often struggle with slow or non-convergence when dealing with multiple modes or flat regions of the target distributions. This paper develops a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach for non-identified models, leveraging the knowledge of observationally equivalent sets of parameters, and highlights an important role that identification plays in modern Bayesian analysis. We show that our proposal overcomes the issues of being trapped in a local mode and achieves a faster rate of convergence than the existing MCMC techniques including random walk Metropolis-Hastings and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. The gain in the speed of convergence is more significant as the dimension or cardinality of the identified sets increases. Simulation studies show its superior performance compared to other popular computational methods including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo. We also demonstrate that our method uncovers non-trivial modes in the target distribution in a structural vector moving-average (SVMA) application."

With the growing availability of data and compute, machine learning has become a promising alternative to first-principles methods to build accurate macroscopic models from microscopic trajectory simulations. However, for spatially extended systems, direct simulations of sufficiently large microscopic systems that inform macroscopic behavior is prohibitive. In this work, we propose a framework that learns the macroscopic dynamics of large stochastic microscopic systems using only small-system simulations. Our framework employs a partial evolution scheme to generate training data pairs by evolving large-system snapshots within local patches. We subsequently identify the closure variables associated with the macroscopic observables and learn the macroscopic dynamics using a custom loss. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical upsampling scheme that enables efficient generation of large-system snapshots from small-system trajectory distributions. We empirically demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our framework through a variety of stochastic spatially extended systems, including those described by stochastic partial differential equations, idealised lattice spin systems, and a more realistic NbMoTa alloy system."

However, these models remain sensitive to mismatches in preprocessing, particularly on time-scales, between pretraining and downstream settings. We systematically examine how time-scale mismatches affects generalization and find that existing representations lack invariance. To address this, we introduce Time-scale Augmented Pretraining (TSAP), which consistently improves robustness to different time-scales across decoding tasks and builds invariance in the representation space.

In two-dimensional triangular lattices, the coexistence of such exchange frustration along with geometric frustration gives rise to a rich landscape of competing magnetic phases, establishing monolayer triangular $d^7$ cobaltates as a compelling platform for frustrated magnetism. Here we investigate a representative triangular-lattice monolayer cobaltate CoBr$_2$, where first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a dominant nearest-neighbor $t_{2g}$-$e_g$ hopping channel that enhances the ferromagnetic Kitaev-type exchange interactions. In contrast, the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg term is highly sensitive to a direct $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ hopping path and electronic correlations. The magnetic exchange parameters are evaluated using the hopping amplitudes obtained from DFT calculations within an exact diagonalization framework. We construct the first and third nearest neighbor Heisenberg exchange dependent $J_1$-$J_3$ magnetic phase diagram in the physically relevant regime and identify multiple competing ground states, including ferromagnetic, stripy, spiral, and $120^{\\circ}$ antiferromagnetic orders. The Luttinger-Tisza analysis further predicts a Z$_2$ vortex crystal phase, while exact diagonalization reveals a bond-nematic phase stabilized by the longer-range couplings. Going beyond the conventional bond-independent XXZ picture typically applied to Co$^{2+}$ systems, our results on monolayer CoBr$_2$ establish d$^7$ cobalt dihalides as a promising platform to explore the interplay of long-range Heisenberg and bond-dependent exchange interactions that can stabilize diverse magnetic ground states on a triangular lattice."

The twelve resulting spectral data cubes have different fields of view, spatial, and spectral resolutions. The wavelength range of each cube partially overlaps with the neighboring bands, and the overlap regions typically show flux mismatches which have to be corrected by spectral stitching methods. Stitching methods aim to produce a single data cube incorporating the data of the individual sub-channels, which requires matching the spatial resolution and the flux discrepancies. We present Haute Couture, a novel stitching algorithm which uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to perform a matrix completion, where the available MRS data cubes are treated as twelve sub-matrices of a larger incomplete matrix. Prior to matrix completion, we also introduce a novel pre-processing to homogenize the global intensities of the twelve cubes. Our pre-processing consists in jointly optimizing a set of global scale parameters that maximize the fit between the cubes where spectral overlap occurs. We apply our novel stitching method to JWST data obtained as part of the PDRs4All observing program of the Orion Bar, and produce a uniform cube reconstructed with the best spatial resolution over the full range of wavelengths."

This paper seeks to harness the capabilities of diffusion models within a visuomotor policy framework that merges visual and textual inputs to generate precise robotic trajectories. By employing reference demonstrations during training, the model learns to execute manipulation tasks specified through textual commands within the robot's immediate environment. The proposed research aims to extend an existing model by leveraging improved embeddings, and adapting techniques from diffusion models for image generation. We evaluate our methods on the CALVIN dataset, proving enhanced performance on various manipulation tasks and an increased long-horizon success rate when multiple tasks are executed in sequence. Our approach reinforces the usefulness of diffusion models and contributes towards general multitask manipulation."

    "abstract": "Lead (Pb) is a typical low-melting-point ductile metal and serves as an important model material in the study of dynamic responses. Under shock-wave loading, its dynamic mechanical behavior comprises two key phenomena: plastic deformation and shock induced phase transitions. The underlying mechanisms of these processes are still poorly understood. Revealing these mechanisms remains challenging for experimental approaches. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations are an alternative theoretical tool for studying dynamic responses, as they capture atomic-scale mechanisms such as defect evolution and deformation pathways. However, due to the limited accuracy of empirical interatomic potentials, the reliability of previous NEMD studies is questioned. Using our newly developed machine learning potential for Pb-Sn alloys, we revisited the microstructure evolution in response to shock loading under various shock orientations. The results reveal that shock loading along the [001] orientation of Pb exhibits a fast, reversible, and massive phase transition and stacking fault evolution. The behavior of Pb differs from previous studies by the absence of twinning during plastic deformation. Loading along the [011] orientation leads to slow, irreversible plastic deformation, and a localized FCC-BCC phase transition in the Pitsch orientation relationship. This study provides crucial theoretical insights into the dynamic mechanical response of Pb, offering a theoretical input for understanding the microstructure-performance relationship under extreme conditions."

    "abstract": "The advent of multimodal deep learning models, such as CLIP, has unlocked new frontiers in a wide range of applications, from image-text understanding to classification tasks. However, these models are not safe for adversarial attacks, particularly backdoor attacks, which can subtly manipulate model behavior. Moreover, existing defense methods typically involve training from scratch or fine-tuning using a large dataset without pinpointing the specific labels that are affected. In this study, we introduce an innovative strategy to enhance the robustness of multimodal contrastive learning models against such attacks. In particular, given a poisoned CLIP model, our approach can identify the backdoor trigger and pinpoint the victim samples and labels in an efficient manner. To that end, an image segmentation ``oracle'' is introduced as the supervisor for the output of the poisoned CLIP. We develop two algorithms to rectify the poisoned model: (1) differentiating between CLIP and Oracle's knowledge to identify potential triggers; (2) pinpointing affected labels and victim samples, and curating a compact fine-tuning dataset. With this knowledge, we are allowed to rectify the poisoned CLIP model to negate backdoor effects. Extensive experiments on visual recognition benchmarks demonstrate our strategy is effective in CLIP-based backdoor defense."

    "abstract": "Adaptive learning often diagnoses precisely yet intervenes weakly, producing help that is mistimed or misaligned. This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted microinterventions. The adaptive learning algorithm includes three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted limit for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formulate intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows derived from ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy with diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency settings, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid switches along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with 1204 students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for nearly all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by about 12 percentage points relative to greedy and produced more consistent difficulty alignment, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy at lower computational cost in resource-scarce environments. Slack variables localized missing content and guided targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across student subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic pedagogical loop and enables equitable, load-aware personalization at the classroom scale."

Moreover, NNN hoppings play a fundamental role in understanding effects of doping on magnetism and pairing orders in strongly interacting regimes. In this article, we review the recent progress in understanding the different competing phases of this model in one and two dimensions from a computational perspective. We comment on the pressing technical challenges, illustrate the controversial results concerning the emergence of the SC phase, and conclude with our perspectives on future explorations."

In response, we propose an asymptotically minimax approach to multi-target conformal prediction that provides tight prediction intervals while ensuring joint marginal coverage. We then outline how our minimax approach can be applied to multi-metric blind image quality assessment, multi-task uncertainty quantification, and multi-round measurement acquisition. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the benefits of our minimax method, relative to existing multi-target conformal prediction methods, using both synthetic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data."

Part I provides a thorough review of General Relativity, Metric-Affine gauge theory and Thomas-Whitehead (TW) Gravity. Part II constructs a gauge gravitational theory based on the Projective General Linear Group, wherein the newly found projective symmetric teleparallel (PST) connections are defined. Generalizing to non-inertial frames, and using nonlinear gauge symmetry realizations to implement local Lorentz symmetry, we construct a general geometric framework that unifies TW and Metric-Affine gravity with projectively invariant spacetime torsion. We introduce projective generalized Higgs fields and show how certain gauge choices reduce these to fundamental projective fields, and how they may be used to define fundamental geometric objects such as the projective 2-frame and spacetime connection. A Lovelock-inspired action is shown to support only curvature (metric) dynamics, implying a topologically constrained Schouten field via the Pontrjagin density. The projective Pontrjagin density is shown to contain a new topological invariant, not present in the literature. Part III formulates projective spinors by defining gamma matrices via the projective linear group metric, then employing nonlinear gauge symmetry realizations to ensure local Lorentz covariance. A general spinor metric introduces a complex phase of redundancy. Requiring a real, Hermitian action leads to a projective Einstein-Cartan-type theory. An induced chiral mass emerges without CP violation."

Here, we report on the detection and quantification of both HNC and HCN isomers in low-temperature plasmas generated from N$_2$/H$_2$/CH$_4$ mixtures using quantum cascade laser and frequency comb absorption spectroscopy. The identification of HNC is confirmed by comparison with molecular spectroscopic databases. The observed [HNC]/[HCN] abundance ratio of $\\sim 10^{-4}$ is far lower than reported values in interstellar media, where ratios can reach unity. We attribute this stark difference to fundamentally different kinetics, dominated by an interplay between formation of vibrationally 'hot' intermediates (HCN* and HNC*) and their subsequent stabilization and destruction. This mechanism contrasts with cold interstellar environments, where dissociative recombination reactions dominate and the formed HNC persists and accumulates over astrochemical timescales. Our results highlight the overlooked role of HNC in plasma chemistry containing carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen, with implications for plasma-assisted HCN synthesis and nitrogen-carbon plasma processes in surface modification and material treatments."

This study presents a comparative analysis of three Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) (BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa) for ransomware detection using two structured datasets: UGRansome and Process Memory (PM). Since LLMs are primarily designed for natural language processing (NLP), numerical and categorical ransomware features were transformed into textual sequences using KBinsDiscretizer and token-based encoding. This enabled the models to learn behavioural patterns from system activity and network traffic through contextual embeddings. The models were fine-tuned on approximately 2,500 labelled samples and evaluated using accuracy, F1 score, and ROC-AUC. To ensure transparent decision-making in this high-stakes domain, two explainable AI techniques (LIME and SHAP) were applied to interpret feature contributions. The results show that the models learn distinct ransomware-related cues: BERT relies heavily on dominant file-operation features, RoBERTa demonstrates balanced reliance on network and financial signals, while DeBERTa exhibits strong sensitivity to financial and network-traffic indicators. Visualisation of embeddings further reveals structural differences in token representation, with RoBERTa producing more isotropic embeddings and DeBERTa capturing highly directional, disentangled patterns. In general, RoBERTa achieved the strongest F1-score, while BERT yielded the highest ROC-AUC performance. The integration of LLMs with XAI provides a transparent framework capable of identifying feature-level evidence behind ransomware predictions."

This system utilizes the power-dividing characteristic of a magic-Tee to lock two magnetrons. Frequency tuning is applied to adjust the phase difference between the two magnetrons' signals so as to achieve a high combining efficiency.

This constraint, which provides a more realistic representation of gain saturation than the commonly used spherical constraint, prevents intensity condensation while preserving the dense, long-range interaction structure characteristic of many multistate random lasers. The model effective Hamiltonian is a function of mode amplitudes with random frequencies and is defined on a complete mode-locked graph. Using large-scale GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulations with the Parallel Tempering algorithm, we analyze systems of varying sizes to probe their thermodynamic-limit behavior. Finite-size scaling of the specific heat, of the Parisi overlap distributions, and of the inverse participation ratio's reveals a spin-glass transition, with critical exponents matching the mean-field Random Energy Model universality class. The smoothed-cubic constraint produces broad, non-condensed intensity distributions, avoiding the pseudo-condensation seen in spherical models on the same interaction graph. Our results show that more realistic gain-saturation constraints preserve spin-glass characteristics while enabling simulations of larger, more dilute systems, providing a robust framework for studying glassy random lasers with self-starting mode-locking."

Charged hadron jets as well as flavor separated quark and gluon-initiated jets with momentum 40-60 GeV and R=0.4 are analyzed. The ratio of the charge-weighted distribution to the inclusive EEC, which reflects the magnitude of charge correlations, is consistently negative, demonstrating the dominance of opposite-charge pairs due to charge conservation. In Pb+Pb collisions, significant medium modifications are observed. The A+A to p+p ratio for charge correlations exhibits a universal pattern across jet types, showing no flavor dependence. Jet quenching enhances opposite-charge correlations at small angles while reducing them at large angles, leading to a steeper angular distance RL dependence of charge correlations in A+A, indicating a more rapid decorrelation behavior as RL increases. A distinctive V-shaped modification pattern appears in the plateau-like enhancement in the transition and small-RL region, independent of jet flavor. Through factorization of the EEC into charged hadron pair multiplicity and average energy weighting distributions, we identify enhanced energy weighting of opposite-charge pairs at small RL as the origin of the V-shaped modification. Also, the plateau-like enhancement of charge correlations is found to be unrelated to selection bias effects."

Across nine VLMs, EVA02-CLIP and large OpenCLIP variants lie on a favorable invariance-sensitivity frontier, combining low paraphrase-induced variance with consistently higher scores for original captions than for their flipped counterparts. In contrast, SigLIP and SigLIP2 show much larger invariance error and often prefer flipped captions to the human descriptions, especially for object and color edits.

The quantum point contacts can tune electrically the number of conduction channels. We theoretically investigate an effect of the increase of channels on the emergence of Weyl points. The increase of channels causes the increase of Andreev bound states in the system, which increase the emergence probability of Weyl points. When all terminals have two channels, the emergence probability is up to 17\\%, which is about four times larger than that for all single channel junctions. We consider the balance of the number of conduction channels in the four terminals. When the number of channels is unbalanced, the increase of emergence probability is suppressed."

GUED reveals information about the nuclear motions that is complementary to the information on the electronic states provided by spectroscopic measurements. GUED experiments so far have utilized a single laser pulse to excite the molecules and an electron pulse to probe the dynamics. This limits the excited states which can be studied to only those that can be reached by absorption of a photon from the ground state or in some cases simultaneous absorption of multiple photons. A broader class of experiments and dynamics can be accessed using two time-delayed laser pulses to access unexplored regions of the potential energy surfaces. As a proof-of-principle experiment using a double excitation, we studied the photodissociation of trifluoroiodomethane molecules that are pre-excited with an infrared (800 nm) femtosecond laser pulse before photo-dissociation is triggered with an ultraviolet (266 nm) femtosecond laser pulse. We have observed significant differences in the dissociation dynamics, with pre-excitation resulting in a slower dissociation process. This new capability can offer new insights on the evolution of nuclear wavepackets in regions of the excited potential energy surface which are inaccessible in single photon excitation. We present a methodology to carry out the measurement, analyze and interpret the data that could be applied to a broad class of experiments."

    "abstract": "Environmental modeling faces critical challenges in predicting ecosystem dynamics across unmonitored regions due to limited and geographically imbalanced observation data. This challenge is compounded by spatial heterogeneity, causing models to learn spurious patterns that fit only local data. Unlike conventional domain generalization, environmental modeling must preserve invariant physical relationships and temporal coherence during augmentation. In this paper, we introduce Generalizable Representation Enhancement via Auxiliary Transformations (GREAT), a framework that effectively augments available datasets to improve predictions in completely unseen regions. GREAT guides the augmentation process to ensure that the original governing processes can be recovered from the augmented data, and the inclusion of the augmented data leads to improved model generalization. Specifically, GREAT learns transformation functions at multiple layers of neural networks to augment both raw environmental features and temporal influence. They are refined through a novel bi-level training process that constrains augmented data to preserve key patterns of the original source data. We demonstrate GREAT's effectiveness on stream temperature prediction across six ecologically diverse watersheds in the eastern U.S., each containing multiple stream segments. Experimental results show that GREAT significantly outperforms existing methods in zero-shot scenarios. This work provides a practical solution for environmental applications where comprehensive monitoring is infeasible."

    "abstract": "In the area of explainable artificial intelligence, Symbolic Regression (SR) has emerged as a promising approach by discovering interpretable mathematical expressions that fit data. However, SR faces two main challenges: most methods are evaluated on scientific datasets with well-understood relationships, limiting generalization, and SR primarily targets single-output regression, whereas many real-world problems involve multi-target outputs with interdependent variables. To address these issues, we propose multi-task regression GINN-LP (MTRGINN-LP), an interpretable neural network for multi-target symbolic regression. By integrating GINN-LP with a multi-task deep learning, the model combines a shared backbone including multiple power-term approximator blocks with task-specific output layers, capturing inter-target dependencies while preserving interpretability. We validate multi-task GINN-LP on practical multi-target applications, including energy efficiency prediction and sustainable agriculture. Experimental results demonstrate competitive predictive performance alongside high interpretability, effectively extending symbolic regression to broader real-world multi-output tasks."

In this paper, we use the covariant light-front approach to study the nonleptonic $B_{(s)}$ meson decays to the first radially excited states $D_{(s)}(2S)$ and $D^{*}_{(s)}(2S)$. Our results reveal that many channels exhibit large branching ratios in the range $10^{-5}\\sim 10^{-4}$, even up to $10^{-3}$ for individual channels, which are detectable by current experiments. Our predictions for the decays $B_{(s)}\\to D^{(*)}_{(s)}(2S)(π,ρ,K^{(*)})$ are larger than those given by the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation method, but agree well with the relativistic quark mode (RQM) and the relativistic independent quark model (RIQM) calculations. For comparison, we also present the branching ratios of the decays $B_{(s)}\\to D^{(*)}_{(s)}(1S)(π,ρ,K^{(*)})$, which are comparable with other theoretical results and the data. Although the branching ratios of the decays $B_{(s)} \\to D^{*}_{(s)}(1S)(ρ,K^*)$ are much larger than those of the decays $B_{(s)} \\to D^{*}_{(s)}(2S)(ρ,K^*)$, the polarization properties between them are similar, that is, the longitudinal polarization fractions are dominant and can amount roughly to $90\\%$."

    "abstract": "Gaussian quantum states and channels are pivotal across many branches of quantum science and their applications, including the processing and storage of quantum information, the investigation of thermodynamics in the quantum regime, and quantum computation. The great advantage is that Gaussian states are experimentally accessible via their first and second statistical moments. In this work, we investigate parameter estimation for Gaussian states, in which the probe-state preparation stage involves two noncommutative Gaussian measurements on the position and momentum observables, introducing tunable parameters. The influence of these noncommutative Gaussian measurements is investigated through the quantum Fisher information (QFI). We showed that the QFI for characterizing Gaussian channels can be increased by adjusting the uncertainty parameters in the preparation of the probe state. Furthermore, if the probe is initially in a thermal state, probe-state preparation may generate quantum coherence in its energy basis. We showed that not only does the amount of coherence affect the improvement of the QFI, but also the rate of change of the coherence with respect to the parameter to be estimated. The proposed probe-state protocol is applied to two paradigmatic single-mode Gaussian channels, the attenuator and amplification channels, which are building blocks of Gaussian quantum information. Our results contribute to the use of coherence in quantum metrology and are experimentally feasible in quantum-optical devices."

    "abstract": "Industrial process monitoring increasingly relies on sensor-generated time-series data, yet the lack of labels, high variability, and operational noise make it difficult to extract meaningful patterns using conventional methods. Existing clustering techniques either rely on fixed distance metrics or deep models designed for static data, limiting their ability to handle dynamic, unstructured industrial sequences. Addressing this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework for unsupervised discovery of operational modes in univariate time-series data using image-based convolutional clustering with composite internal evaluation. The proposed framework improves upon existing approaches in three ways: (1) raw time-series sequences are transformed into grayscale matrix representations via overlapping sliding windows, allowing effective feature extraction using a deep convolutional autoencoder; (2) the framework integrates both soft and hard clustering outputs and refines the selection through a two-stage strategy; and (3) clustering performance is objectively evaluated by a newly developed composite score, S_eva, which combines normalized Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, and Davies-Bouldin indices. Applied to over 3900 furnace melting operations from a Nordic foundry, the method identifies seven explainable operational patterns, revealing significant differences in energy consumption, thermal dynamics, and production duration. Compared to classical and deep clustering baselines, the proposed approach achieves superior overall performance, greater robustness, and domain-aligned explainability. The framework addresses key challenges in unsupervised time-series analysis, such as sequence irregularity, overlapping modes, and metric inconsistency, and provides a generalizable solution for data-driven diagnostics and energy optimization in industrial systems."

While exact optimization methods like Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) can ensure coherence, their computational complexity is often prohibitive. Conversely, simpler greedy heuristics that optimize for query coverage alone often fail to find these coherent, joinable sets. This paper frames multi-table retrieval as an iterative search process, arguing this approach offers advantages in scalability, interpretability, and flexibility. We propose a general framework and a concrete instantiation: a fast, effective Greedy Join-Aware Retrieval algorithm that holistically balances relevance, coverage, and joinability. Experiments across 5 NL2SQL benchmarks demonstrate that our iterative method achieves competitive retrieval performance compared to the MIP-based approach while being 4-400x faster depending on the benchmark and search space settings. This work highlights the potential of iterative heuristics for practical, scalable, and composition-aware retrieval."

    "abstract": "The remarkable progress of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on a variety of tasks has raised interest in their application to automated driving. However, for these models to be trusted in such a safety-critical domain, they must first possess robust perception capabilities, i.e., they must be capable of understanding a traffic scene, which can often be highly complex, with many things happening simultaneously. Moreover, since critical objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at long distances, we require systems with not only strong perception capabilities at close distances (up to 20 meters), but also at long (30+ meters) range. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the perception capabilities of these models in isolation from other skills like reasoning or advanced world knowledge. Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA) is a Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark designed specifically for this purpose: it can be used to evaluate the perception systems of VLMs in traffic scenarios using trivial yet crucial questions relevant to driving decisions. It consists of two parts: a synthetic benchmark (DTP-Synthetic) created using a simulator, and a real-world benchmark (DTP-Real) built on top of existing images of real traffic scenes. Additionally, DTPQA includes distance annotations, i.e., how far the object in question is from the camera. More specifically, each DTPQA sample consists of (at least): (a) an image, (b) a question, (c) the ground truth answer, and (d) the distance of the object in question, enabling analysis of how VLM performance degrades with increasing object distance. In this article, we provide the dataset itself along with the Python scripts used to create it, which can be used to generate additional data of the same kind."

This study presents a methodology for evaluating the effects of injecting 20Mt of SO$_2$ into the atmosphere annually on the global radiative balance, photovoltaic potentials, and renewable energy systems under a targeted temperature reduction of 2°C. Results show that the average annual reduction of PV potentials ranges from 0.25% to 4% up to 12% in Northern Europe during summer. The modeled renewable energy systems largely absorb these reductions resulting in minor capacity shifts with larger changes confined to a few systems. The results show that the inherent flexibility of large scale renewable energy systems helps mitigating changes in cost, but understanding this flexibility is crucial to avoid errors in design."

Between the two spots, flux emergence is still ongoing influencing the velocity pattern. We observed the active region NOAA 12146 on August 24, 2014, with the GREGOR Fabry-Pérot Interferometer (GFPI) and the Blue Imaging Channel (BIC) of the GREGOR solar telescope at Observatorio del Teide on Tenerife. Context data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) complement the high-resolution data. In the penumbra of a newly formed spot, we observe opposite Doppler velocity streams of up to +-2 km/s very close to each other. These velocities extend beyond the outer penumbral boundary and cross also the polarity-inversion line. The properties of the magnetic field do not change significantly between these two streams. Although the magnetic field is almost horizontal, we do not detect large transversal velocities in horizontal flow maps obtained with the local correlation technique. The ongoing emergence of magnetic flux in an active region causes flows of opposite directions intruding the penumbra of a pre-existing sunspot."

We investigate this by training GPT-2 models on three spatial learning paradigms in grid environments: passive exploration (Foraging Model- predicting steps in random walks), goal-directed planning (generating optimal shortest paths) on structured Hamiltonian paths (SP-Hamiltonian), and a hybrid model fine-tuned with exploratory data (SP-Random Walk). Using behavioural, representational and mechanistic analyses, we uncover two fundamentally different learned algorithms. The Foraging model develops a robust, map-like representation of space, akin to a 'cognitive map'. Causal interventions reveal that it learns to consolidate spatial information into a self-sufficient coordinate system, evidenced by a sharp phase transition where its reliance on historical direction tokens vanishes by the middle layers of the network. The model also adopts an adaptive, hierarchical reasoning system, switching between a low-level heuristic for short contexts and map-based inference for longer ones. In contrast, the goal-directed models learn a path-dependent algorithm, remaining reliant on explicit directional inputs throughout all layers. The hybrid model, despite demonstrating improved generalisation over its parent, retains the same path-dependent strategy. These findings suggest that the nature of spatial intelligence in transformers may lie on a spectrum, ranging from generalisable world models shaped by exploratory data to heuristics optimised for goal-directed tasks. We provide a mechanistic account of this generalisation-optimisation trade-off and highlight how the choice of training regime influences the strategies that emerge."

This resource integrates the richness of community-driven OSM data with the hierarchical structure of FS, enabling reproducible and interoperable urban analytics. The dataset is complemented by an evaluation of embedding and LLM-based alignment strategies and a pipeline that supports scalable updates as OSM evolves. Together, these elements provide both a robust reference resource and a practical tool for the community.

We establish comprehensive convergence guarantees for this approach. First, we prove sublinear convergence for non-convex dual objectives and linear convergence under the Polyak-Łojasiewicz condition.

    "abstract": "Coexistence of nontrivial topology and flat electronic bands in low-energy lattices provides a fertile platform for correlated quantum states. The square-octagon lattice hosts Dirac nodes and flat bands at half-filling, yet the influence of intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and staggered magnetic flux on its topological and flat-band properties remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine this lattice using tight-binding models that include SOC and magnetic flux, uncovering a quantum spin Hall phase with spin Chern number $C_s=1$, crossovers to quantum anomalous Hall phases with $C=1$ and $C=2$, and higher-order topological insulator phases carrying quantized quadrupolar corner charges. The initially dispersionless flat bands evolve into quasi-flat, topologically nontrivial bands with uniform quantum geometry and large flatness ratios, conducive to fractional Chern insulator states. We further identify realistic material candidates, including octagraphene, transition-metal dichalcogenides, synthetic $\\mathrm{MoSi_2N_4}$, and magnetic $α$-MnO$_2$, as potential candidates for realizing tunable topological phases intertwined with flat-band physics, opening new opportunities for correlated topological matter."

    "abstract": "We report a point spread function (PSF) and deconvolution procedure to remove stray light from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) data. Pre-launch calibration observations, post-launch Venus transit and lunar transit data were used to develop the PSF and evaluate how well it reproduced the observed scattering. The PSF reported differs from previous stray light removal efforts since we do not use Gaussians as the central mathematical component. Instead, we use a Lorenztian convolved with an Airy function. In 2018, the HMI team began providing full-disk, stray-light-corrected data daily. Intensity, Doppler, magnetogram, and vector magnetic field data are provided. The deconvolution uses a Richardson-Lucy algorithm and takes less than one second per full-disk image. The results, on average, show decreases in umbral continuum intensity, a doubling of the granulation intensity contrast, increases in the total field strength, most notably in plage by $\\sim$1.4--2.5 the original value, and a partial correction for the convective blueshift. Local helioseismology analyses using corrected data yield results that are consistent with those from uncorrected data, with only negligible differences, except in sunspot regions. The new data are found in JSOC with names similar to the original but with the qualifying term '$\\_dcon$' or '$\\_dconS$' appended, denoting whether the deconvolution was applied to the filtergrams or Stokes images. The HMI team recommends using the corrected data for improved visual clarity, more accurate irradiance reconstruction, better co-alignment with high-resolution data, reduced errors in tracking algorithms, and improved magnetic field strengths."

Recently, we have proposed using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) as the WF method for molecules containing strongly correlated fragments [Beran, P. et al. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2023, 14, 3, 716-722]. In this work, we demonstrate that the accuracy of the DMRG-in-DFT approach is primarily limited by the approximate treatment of the coupling between the active component and its environment through nonadditive exchange-correlation functionals. To address this issue, we combine exact exchange to reduce the nonadditive exchange error with a multireference adiabatic connection (AC) scheme to recover nonadditive correlation. The performance of the improved DMRG-in-DFT embedding is illustrated on two prototypical strongly correlated systems: the dissociation of the H20 chain and the cleavage of a triple CN bond in propionitrile."

    "abstract": "Supervised learning with tabular data presents unique challenges, including low data sizes, the absence of structural cues, and heterogeneous features spanning both categorical and continuous domains. Unlike vision and language tasks, where models can exploit inductive biases in the data, tabular data lacks inherent positional structure, hindering the effectiveness of self-attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based models like TabTransformer, SAINT, and FT-Transformer (which we refer to as 3T) have shown promise on tabular data, they typically operate without leveraging structural cues such as positional encodings (PEs), as no prior structural information is usually available. In this work, we find both theoretically and empirically that structural cues, specifically PEs can be a useful tool to improve generalization performance for tabular transformers. We find that PEs impart the ability to reduce the effective rank (a form of intrinsic dimensionality) of the features, effectively simplifying the task by reducing the dimensionality of the problem, yielding improved generalization. To that end, we propose Tab-PET (PEs for Tabular Transformers), a graph-based framework for estimating and inculcating PEs into embeddings. Inspired by approaches that derive PEs from graph topology, we explore two paradigms for graph estimation: association-based and causality-based. We empirically demonstrate that graph-derived PEs significantly improve performance across 50 classification and regression datasets for 3T. Notably, association-based graphs consistently yield more stable and pronounced gains compared to causality-driven ones. Our work highlights an unexpected role of PEs in tabular transformers, revealing how they can be harnessed to improve generalization."

This approach leverages an iterative self-paced learning pipeline to progressively enhance output quality through synthetic data generation and validation cycles, eliminating the need for extensive manual data annotation. Evaluation across 3,600 diverse samples in five scripting languages demonstrates statistically significant improvements between iterations, showing consistent gains in both summary quality and classification accuracy. Our comprehensive validation approach combines quantitative metrics based on established malware labels with qualitative assessment from both human experts and LLM-based judges, confirming both technical precision and linguistic coherence of generated summaries.

One major challenge in realizing this technology is designing robust electrostatic pulses to realize unitaries on qubits. Current practice when calibrating unitaries involves recursive experimentation to find the highest-fidelity pulses. To accelerate this process for experimentalists, we implement Qalibrate, a fast, JAX-enabled simulator that generates pulses given target unitaries. Specifically, we generate a propagator that models the time evolution of three-electron spin qubits and integrate our gradient-based optimizer to generate the pulses. The simulation involves solving the Lindblad master equation, which we parallelize by employing an approximation of the time evolution called the Magnus expansion. Qalibrate shows up to a 34x speedup compared to an existing ODE simulator, making progress towards generating robust pulses for n-qubit systems."

    "abstract": "Neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping with single-dish experiments is a powerful approach for probing cosmology in the post-reionization epoch. However, the presence of bright foregrounds over four orders of magnitude stronger than the HI signal makes its extraction highly challenging. While all methods perform well when assuming a Gaussian beam degraded to the worst resolution, most of them degrade significantly in the presence of a more realistic beam model. In this work, we investigate the performance of SDecGMCA. This method extends DecGMCA to spherical data, combining sparse component separation with beam deconvolution. Our goal is to evaluate this method in comparison with established foreground removal techniques, assessing its ability to recover the cosmological HI signal from single-dish intensity mapping observations under varying beam conditions. We use simulated HI signal and foregrounds, covering the frequency ranges relevant to MeerKAT and SKA-Mid. The foreground removal techniques tested fall into two main categories: model-fitting methods (polynomial and parametric) and blind source separation methods (PCA, ICA, GMCA, and SDecGMCA). Their effectiveness is evaluated based on the recovery of the HI angular and frequency power spectra under progressively more realistic beam conditions. While all methods perform adequately under a uniform degraded beam, SDecGMCA remains robust when frequency-dependent beam distortions are introduced. In the oscillating beam case, SDecGMCA suppresses the spurious spectral peak at $k_ν\\sim 0.3$ and achieves $\\lesssim 5\\%$ accuracy at intermediate angular scales ($10 < \\ell < 200$), outperforming other methods. Beam inversion, however, remains intrinsically unstable beyond $\\ell \\sim 200$, setting a practical limit on the method."

    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning is one of the state-of-the-art methods for producing near-optimal system controllers. However, deep RL algorithms train a deep neural network, that lacks transparency, which poses challenges when the controller has to meet regulations, or foster trust. To alleviate this, one could transfer the learned behaviour into a model that is human-readable by design using knowledge distilla- tion. Often this is done with a single model which mimics the original model on average but could struggle in more dynamic situations. A key challenge is that this simpler model should have the right balance be- tween flexibility and complexity or right balance between balance bias and accuracy. We propose a new model-agnostic method to divide the state space into regions where a simplified, human-understandable model can operate in. In this paper, we use Voronoi partitioning to find regions where linear models can achieve similar performance to the original con- troller. We evaluate our approach on a gridworld environment and a classic control task. We observe that our proposed distillation to locally- specialized linear models produces policies that are explainable and show that the distillation matches or even slightly outperforms the black-box policy they are distilled from."

    "abstract": "The Metaverse promises immersive, real-time experiences; however, meeting its stringent latency and resource demands remains a major challenge. Conventional optimization techniques struggle to respond effectively under dynamic edge conditions and high user loads. In this study, we explore a slice-enabled in-network edge architecture that combines computing-in-the-network (COIN) with multi-access edge computing (MEC). In addition, we formulate the joint problem of wireless and computing resource management with optimal slice selection as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). Because solving this model online is computationally intensive, we decompose it into three sub-problems (SP1) intra-slice allocation, (SP2) inter-slice allocation, and (SP3) offloading decision and train a distributed hierarchical DeepSets-based model (DeepSets-S) on optimal solutions obtained offline. In the proposed model, we design a slack-aware normalization mechanism for a shared encoder and task-specific decoders, ensuring permutation equivariance over variable-size wireless device (WD) sets. The learned system produces near-optimal allocations with low inference time and maintains permutation equivariance over variable-size device sets. Our experimental results show that DeepSets-S attains high tolerance-based accuracies on SP1/SP2 (Acc1 = 95.26% and 95.67%) and improves multiclass offloading accuracy on SP3 (Acc = 0.7486; binary local/offload Acc = 0.8824). Compared to exact solvers, the proposed approach reduces the execution time by 86.1%, while closely tracking the optimal system cost (within 6.1% in representative regimes). Compared with baseline models, DeepSets-S consistently achieves higher cost ratios and better utilization across COIN/MEC resources."

This system exhibits quantum bistability and supports a logical manifold for a bosonic qubit. Using Kramer's theory together with the $P$-representation, we derive an analytical expression for the bit-flip error rate within the potential-barrier approximation. The agreement is demonstrated between analytical calculations and numerical simulations obtained by diagonalization of the Liouvillian superoperator. In the purely dissipative limit, the switching rate increases monotonically with detuning, as the two metastable states approach each other in phase space. However, the exponential contribution to the bit-flip rate exhibits a nontrivial dependence on system parameters, extending beyond the naive scaling with the average photon number. In the presence of large Kerr nonlinearity, the switching rate becomes a nonmonotonic function of the detuning and reaches a minimum at a finite detuning. This effect arises because detuning lowers the activation barrier for weak nonlinearity but increases it for large ones, ensuring a minimum of the switching-rate at nonzero detuning. These results establish key conditions for optimizing the performance of critical cat qubits and are directly relevant for the design of scalable superconducting bosonic quantum architectures."

Starting from the explicit realization of the free Archimedean $f$-algebra as a sublattice-algebra of $\\mathbb{R}^{E^*}\\!\\!$, we develop a new structure theorem for normed $f$-algebras that allows us to identify the kernel of the maximal submultiplicative lattice seminorm as precisely those functions vanishing on the unit ball $B_{E^*}$.

We prove that this representation extends to an injective map on the completion $\\mathrm{FB{\\it f}A}[E]$ if and only if $\\mathrm{FB{\\it f}A}[E]$ is semiprime, and establish that $\\mathrm{FB{\\it f}A}[E]$ is indeed semiprime whenever $E$ is finite-dimensional or $E=L_1(μ)$. This is closely related to approximating operators into a Banach $f$-algebra by operators into finite-dimensional Banach $f$-algebras. For a finite-dimensional Banach space $E$, a complete description of $\\mathrm{FB{\\it f}A}[E]$ is provided: $\\mathrm{FB{\\it f}A}[E]$ is lattice-algebra isomorphic to $C([0,1]\\times S_{E^{*}})$ equipped with pointwise order and the product given by \\[ (f\\star g)(r,u)=rf(r,u)g(r,u). \\] As a consequence, Banach spaces of the same dimension generate isomorphic free Banach $f$-algebras.

We first introduce an agent to simulate the role of product manager, dubbed PM-Agent, which formulates data requirements to collect data similar to the failure cases. Then, we use a generative model that can simulate both data collection and annotation. However, existing generative models struggle to generate high-fidelity data conditioned on 3D layouts. To address this, we propose DriveSora, which can generate spatiotemporally consistent videos aligned with the 3D annotations requested by PM-Agent. We integrate these components into our self-correcting agentic system, CorrectAD. Importantly, our pipeline is an end-to-end model-agnostic and can be applied to improve any end-to-end planner. Evaluated on both nuScenes and a more challenging in-house dataset across multiple end-to-end planners, CorrectAD corrects 62.5% and 49.8% of failure cases, reducing collision rates by 39% and 27%, respectively."

Besides, unnecessary heading changes, or zig-zag patterns, exist even when no obstacle is nearby, which is inconsistent with the human intuition that the path segments should be straight in wide-open space due to the absence of obstacles. This article puts forward a general and systematic post-processing algorithm for A* and other graph-search-based planners. The A* post-processing algorithm, called APP, is developed based on the costmap, which is widely used in commercial service robots. First, a bidirectional vertices reduction algorithm is proposed to tackle the asymm- etry of the path and the environments. During the forward and backward vertices reduction, a thorough shortcut strategy is put forward to improve the path-shortening performance and avoid unnecessary heading changes. Second, an iterative path perturbation algorithm is adopted to locally reduce the number of unnecessary heading changes and improve the path smooth- ness. Comparative experiments are then carried out to validate the superiority of the proposed method. Quantitative performance indexes show that APP outperforms the existing methods in planning time, path length as well as the number of unnecessary heading changes. Finally, field navigation experiments are carried out to verify the practicability of APP."

In this article, we propose a novel reconciliation framework of the empirical Bayes (EB) and hierarchical Bayes approaches for interval estimation of random effects under a two-level normal model. Our framework shows that a second-order efficient empirical Bayes confidence interval, with EB coverage error of order $O(m^{-3/2})$, $m$ being the number of areas in the area-level model, can also be viewed as a credible interval whose posterior coverage is close to the nominal level, provided a carefully chosen prior - referred to as a 'matching prior' - is placed on the hyperparameters. While existing literature has examined matching priors that reconcile frequentist and Bayesian inference in various settings, this paper is the first to study matching priors with the goal of interval estimation of random effects in a two-level model. We obtain an area-dependent matching prior on the variance component that achieves a proper posterior under mild regularity conditions. The theoretical results in the paper are corroborated through a Monte Carlo simulation study and a real data analysis."

However, the reasoning underlying these solutions is often flawed. Advancing to rigorous proof-based mathematics requires reliable proof verification capabilities. We begin by analyzing multiple evaluation setups and show that focusing on a single benchmark can lead to brittle or misleading conclusions. To address this, we evaluate both proof-based and final-answer reasoning to obtain a more reliable measure of model performance. We then scale two major generative verification methods (GenSelect and LLM-as-a-Judge) to millions of tokens and identify their combination as the most effective framework for solution verification and selection. We further show that the choice of prompt for LLM-as-a-Judge significantly affects the model's performance, but reinforcement learning can reduce this sensitivity. However, despite improving proof-level metrics, reinforcement learning does not enhance final-answer precision, indicating that current models often reward stylistic or procedural correctness rather than mathematical validity.

We report quasi-simultaneous, high-sensitivity, multifrequency very long baseline interferometric polarimetry of M87 spanning 1.4-24.4GHz. We present high-fidelity, Faraday rotation-corrected maps of intrinsic linear polarization that continuously resolve the ACZ in the de-projected distance range of ~9e3 to ~3.6e5 gravitational radii from the black hole. The maps reveal pronounced north-south asymmetries in fractional linear polarization and electric vector position angle (EVPA), peaking in the inner ACZ at a projected distance of ~20mas along the jet and remaining prominent out to ~100mas. These signatures are best reproduced by models with a large-scale, ordered helical field that retains a substantial poloidal component-contrary to the rapid toroidal dominance expected under steady, ideal MHD. This tension implies ongoing magnetic dissipation that limits toroidal buildup over the ACZ. The handedness of the helix provides an independent constraint on the black hole's spin direction, supporting a spin vector oriented away from the observer, consistent with the orientation inferred from horizon-scale imaging. Farther downstream, the asymmetries diminish, and the EVPA and fractional polarization distributions become more symmetric; we tentatively interpret this as evolution toward a more poloidally dominated configuration, while noting current sensitivity and dynamic-range limits."

    "abstract": "A central question in exotic-hadron physics is their internal structure whether these states are loosely bound hadronic molecules or compact multiquark configurations. To shed light on this issue, we develop a model that incorporates mixing between hadronic-molecular and compact multiquark components. We then apply this framework to the specific case of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ and analyze the peak structure in the $D^0D^0π^+$ invariant-mass spectrum reported by LHCb. We find that a scenario based on a predominantly compact tetraquark provides the best fitted solution which can explain the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$. We also find that the model admits two more solutions of comparable quality, both of which imply that the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ is a molecular state: (1) the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ is a $D^{*+}D^0$ molecule and there is a $D^{*0}D^+$ molecular state in addition; (2) the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ is a $D^{*0}D^+$ molecule and an aditional $D^{*+}D^0$ molecular state is found below $D^0D^0π^+$ threshold. These molecular states are not simple $I = 0$ states, but mixtures of $I = 0$ and $I = 1$ states. We show that all three scenarios are also consistent with the experimentally observed near-threshold $D^0D^0$ and $D^0D^+$ invariant-mass distributions."

Such methods have historically overlooked the semantic relevance of the replacement regions to the target object, thereby impairing the model's interpretability and hindering the editing workflow. Addressing these challenges, the present study introduces an innovative methodology named as Weighted Semantic Map with Auto-adaptive Candidate Editing Network (WSAE-Net). Characterized by two significant advancements: the determination of an weighted semantic map and the auto-adaptive candidate editing sequence. First, the generation of the weighted semantic map is designed to maximize the reduction of non-semantic feature units that need to be computed, thereby optimizing computational efficiency. Second, the auto-adaptive candidate editing sequences are designed to determine the optimal computational order among the feature units to be processed, thereby ensuring the efficient generation of counterfactuals while maintaining the semantic relevance of the replacement feature units to the target object. Through comprehensive experimentation, our methodology demonstrates superior performance, contributing to a more lucid and in-depth understanding of visual counterfactual explanations."

We argue that memory is a core ingredient for efficient reasoning: when evidence already exists, models should think less by reusing structured memory instead of recomputing derivations. We present ENGRAM-R, an inference-time memory layer that integrates typed retrieval with compact fact card representations and explicit citation control. On the LoCoMo benchmark, ENGRAM-R reduces input tokens by 85% and reasoning tokens by 75% compared to full context while maintaining high accuracy. On a multi-hop slice of the LongMemEval benchmark, it achieves similar efficiency with substantial accuracy gains. These results show that memory is not only critical for long-horizon correctness but also a practical lever for efficient reasoning under tight compute, memory, and latency budgets."

At the 128-bit level, compared to ISO/IEC standard Grain-128a, the new proposals use Boolean functions with improved cryptographic properties; one of the proposals require a few extra gates, while the other has an overall lower gate count.

A modified form of the ET was proposed for this case, which includes an effective force originating from the interaction of the 1D quantum particle with the box edges. In this work, we derive an amended ET for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which includes the cubic nonlinear term, as well as for the 2D square-shaped potential box. In the latter case, we derive an amended COM equation of motion with an effective force exerted by the edges of the rectangular box, while the nonlinear term makes no direct contribution to the 1D and 2D versions of the ET. Nonetheless, the nonlinearity affects the amended ET through the edge-generated force. As a result, the nonlinearity of the underlying GPE can make the COM motion in the potential box irregular. The validity of the amended ET for the 1D and 2D GPEs with the respective potential boxes is confirmed by the comparison of numerical simulations of the underlying GPE and the corresponding amended COM equation of motion. The reported findings are relevant to the ongoing experiments carried out for atomic Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in the box potentials."

    "abstract": "Contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition yet remain vulnerable to spurious correlations, particularly background over-reliance. We introduce Cluster-based Concept Importance (CCI), a novel interpretability method that uses CLIP's own patch embeddings to group spatial patches into semantically coherent clusters, mask them, and evaluate relative changes in model predictions. CCI sets a new state of the art on faithfulness benchmarks, surpassing prior methods by large margins; for example, it yields more than a twofold improvement on the deletion-AUC metric for MS COCO retrieval. We further propose that CCI, when combined with GroundedSAM, automatically categorizes predictions as foreground- or background-driven, providing a crucial diagnostic ability. Existing benchmarks such as CounterAnimals, however, rely solely on accuracy and implicitly attribute all performance degradation to background correlations. Our analysis shows this assumption to be incomplete, since many errors arise from viewpoint variation, scale shifts, and fine-grained object confusions. To disentangle these effects, we introduce COVAR, a benchmark that systematically varies object foregrounds and backgrounds. Leveraging CCI with COVAR, we present a comprehensive evaluation of eighteen CLIP variants, offering methodological advances and empirical evidence that chart a path toward more robust VLMs."

GrOCE models concepts and their interrelations as a dynamic semantic graph, enabling principled reasoning over dependencies and fine-grained isolation of undesired content. It comprises three components: (1) Dynamic Topological Graph Construction for incremental graph building, (2) Adaptive Cluster Identification for multi-hop traversal with similarity-decay scoring, and (3) Selective Edge Severing for targeted edge removal while preserving global semantics.

    "abstract": "Multivariate time series classification is increasingly investigated in space weather research as a means to predict intense solar flare events, which can cause widespread disruptions across modern technological systems. Magnetic field measurements of solar active regions are converted into structured multivariate time series, enabling predictive modeling across segmented observation windows. However, the inherently imbalanced nature of solar flare occurrences, where intense flares are rare compared to minor flare events, presents a significant barrier to effective learning. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Global Cross-Time Attention Fusion (GCTAF) architecture, a transformer-based model to enhance long-range temporal modeling. Unlike traditional self-attention mechanisms that rely solely on local interactions within time series, GCTAF injects a set of learnable cross-attentive global tokens that summarize salient temporal patterns across the entire sequence. These tokens are refined through cross-attention with the input sequence and fused back into the temporal representation, enabling the model to identify globally significant, non-contiguous time points that are critical for flare prediction. This mechanism functions as a dynamic attention-driven temporal summarizer that augments the model's capacity to capture discriminative flare-related dynamics. We evaluate our approach on the benchmark solar flare dataset and show that GCTAF effectively detects intense flares and improves predictive performance, demonstrating that refining transformer-based architectures presents a high-potential alternative for solar flare prediction tasks."

On the boundary of the disc, the fluid is subjected to a small perturbation of a non zero rotation of rigid body. While at the spacial infinity, the fluid stays at rest. Due to the Prandtl-Batchelor theory, the limiting Euler solution is chosen to be the rotation flow $\\frac{A}{r} e_θ$ for some suitable constant $A$, which is determined by the Batchelor-Wood formula. When the viscosity approaches to zero, we will construct a solution to the 2D Navier-Stokes equations by using higher order asymptotic approximation and show the validity of the boundary layer expansion. Also the asymptotic behavior of the solution at spacial infinity is obtained. Our result partially answers one of the open problems (Problem 11b) raised by V. I. Yudovich in [Eleven great problems of mathematical hydrodynamics, Mosc. Math. J. 3 (2003), no. 2, 711--737].

However, real-world applications also require discovering and classifying multiple anomaly types. Since industrial anomalies are semantically subtle and current methods do not sufficiently exploit image priors, direct clustering approaches often perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose ProtoAnomalyNCD, a prototype-learning-based framework for discovering unseen anomaly classes of multiple types that can be integrated with various anomaly detection methods. First, to suppress background clutter, we leverage Grounded SAM with text prompts to localize object regions as priors for the anomaly classification network. Next, because anomalies usually appear as subtle and fine-grained patterns on the product, we introduce an Anomaly-Map-Guided Attention block. Within this block, we design a Region Guidance Factor that helps the attention module distinguish among background, object regions, and anomalous regions. By using both localized product regions and anomaly maps as priors, the module enhances anomalous features while suppressing background noise and preserving normal features for contrastive learning. Finally, under a unified prototype-learning framework, ProtoAnomalyNCD discovers and clusters unseen anomaly classes while simultaneously enabling multi-type anomaly classification. We further extend our method to detect unseen outliers, achieving task-level unification. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the MVTec AD, MTD, and Real-IAD datasets."

Such a high decline rate makes SN~2016iog one of the fastest declining Type~IIL SNe observed to date. The rapid rise in the light curve, combined with the nearly featureless continuum observed in the spectrum at +9.3 days, suggests the presence of interaction. In the recombination phase, we observed broad H$α$ lines that persist at all epochs. In addition, the prominent double-peaked H$α$ feature observed in the late-time spectrum (+190.8 days) is likely attributable either to significant dust formation within a cool dense shell or to asymmetric circumstellar material. These features suggest the presence of sustained interaction around SN~2016iog. We propose that the observed characteristics of SN~2016iog can be qualitatively explained by assuming a low-mass H-rich envelope surrounding a red supergiant progenitor star with low-density circumstellar material."

The device supports two distinct localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) modes for forward transmission, corresponding to the polarization-dependent (M1) and the polarization-independent (M2) resonances, respectively. This results in the fact that when x-polarized light is incident, only M2 exists; when y-polarized light is incident, both M1 and M2 exist. Besides, both modes yield the maximum isolation ratio of more than 10 dB. The electric field distributions further indicate that M2 exhibits strong confinement and efficient tunneling through the metallic film, while M1 shows weaker but more polarization-sensitive hybridization. The coexistence and tunability of these two modes constitute the physical basis of dual-mode AT, highlighting the AO-GFG structure as a promising platform for high-isolation and polarization-tunable plasmonic devices in the visible and near-infrared regions."

    "abstract": "The cosmological constant problem represents a profound conflict between quantum field theory and general relativity. Unimodular gravity offers a compelling starting point by de-gravitating the vacuum energy of the Standard Model, but this framework traditionally trades the problem of vacuum energy for a fine-tuning of initial conditions, which manifest as a ``shadow\" cosmological constant. In this paper, we resolve this initial conditions problem by proposing a novel modification to gravity based on nonlinear quantum mechanics. We introduce specific state-dependent terms to the Hamiltonian, constructed from expectation values of the metric such as the average Ricci scalar. These terms alter the dynamical equations of gravity such that the shadow energy density associated with unconstrained initial conditions redshifts away with cosmic expansion, rendering it negligible at late times. The resulting cosmology is naturally dominated by matter and radiation without fine-tuning. We demonstrate that this significant infrared modification of gravity is consistent with local and cosmological tests of gravity. We comment on the possibility of testing this solution in cosmological measurements of Newton's constant."

    "abstract": "In post-disaster space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs), terrestrial infrastructure is often impaired, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rapidly restore connectivity for mission-critical ground terminals in cluttered non-line-of-sight (NLoS) urban environments. To enhance coverage, UAVs employ movable antennas (MAs), while reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) on surviving high-rises redirect signals. The key challenge is communication-limited partial observability, leaving each UAV with a narrow, fast-changing neighborhood view that destabilizes value estimation. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches are inadequate--non-communication methods rely on unavailable global critics, heuristic sharing is brittle and redundant, and learnable protocols (e.g., CommNet, DIAL) lose per-neighbor structure and aggravate non-stationarity under tight bandwidth. To address partial observability, we propose a spatiotemporal A2C where each UAV transmits prior-decision messages with local state, a compact policy fingerprint, and a recurrent belief, encoded per neighbor and concatenated. A spatial discount shapes value targets to emphasize local interactions, while analysis under one-hop-per-slot latency explains stable training with delayed views. Experimental results show our policy outperforms IA2C, ConseNet, FPrint, DIAL, and CommNet--achieving faster convergence, higher asymptotic reward, reduced Temporal-Difference(TD)/advantage errors, and a better communication throughput-energy trade-off."

In the extended comparison, BERT demonstrated superior performance (84.49% binary, 72.03% multiclass accuracy) while requiring significantly fewer computational resources (443s vs. 704s training time) than newer architectures. GPT-2 showed lowest overall accuracy (79.34% binary, 71.29% multiclass), while DeBERTa achieved moderate results (80.70% binary, 71.56% multiclass) but at substantially higher computational cost (947s for multiclass training). Error analysis revealed architecture-specific strengths in detecting nuanced hope expressions, with GPT-2 excelling at sarcasm detection (92.46% recall). This study provides a framework for computational analysis of hope, with applications in mental health and social media analysis, while demonstrating that architectural suitability may outweigh model size for specialized emotion detection tasks."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have benefited enormously from scaling, yet these gains are bounded by five fundamental limitations: (1) hallucination, (2) context compression, (3) reasoning degradation, (4) retrieval fragility, and (5) multimodal misalignment. While existing surveys describe these phenomena empirically, they lack a rigorous theoretical synthesis connecting them to the foundational limits of computation, information, and learning. This work closes that gap by presenting a unified, proof-informed framework that formalizes the innate theoretical ceilings of LLM scaling. First, computability and uncomputability imply an irreducible residue of error: for any computably enumerable model family, diagonalization guarantees inputs on which some model must fail, and undecidable queries (e.g., halting-style tasks) induce infinite failure sets for all computable predictors. Second, information-theoretic and statistical constraints bound attainable accuracy even on decidable tasks, finite description length enforces compression error, and long-tail factual knowledge requires prohibitive sample complexity. Third, geometric and computational effects compress long contexts far below their nominal size due to positional under-training, encoding attenuation, and softmax crowding. We further show how likelihood-based training favors pattern completion over inference, how retrieval under token limits suffers from semantic drift and coupling noise, and how multimodal scaling inherits shallow cross-modal alignment. Across sections, we pair theorems and empirical evidence to outline where scaling helps, where it saturates, and where it cannot progress, providing both theoretical foundations and practical mitigation paths like bounded-oracle retrieval, positional curricula, and sparse or hierarchical attention."

In this work, we propose a novel preference-based policy optimization (PbPO) framework that formulates the learning process as a min-max game between the main policy and a reward model (RM). The RM is constrained within a confidence set derived from preference data to ensure reliable exploitation. Our iterative online algorithm actively collects preference data through guided exploration of the evolving policy, enabling continual self-improvement of both the policy and the RM. We provide theoretical guarantees for our method, establishing high-probability regret bounds for both settings with sequence-level RM and token-level RM, demonstrating its effectiveness in bootstrapping LLMs. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art preference optimization techniques."

    "abstract": "We consider routing in reconfigurable networks, which is also known as coflow scheduling in the literature. The algorithmic literature generally (perhaps implicitly) assumes that the amount of data to be transferred is large. Thus the standard way to model a collection of requested data transfers is by an integer demand matrix $D$, where the entry in row $i$ and column $j$ of $D$ is an integer representing the amount of information that the application wants to send from machine/node $i$ to machine/node $j$. A feasible coflow schedule is then a sequence of matchings, which represent the sequence of data transfers that covers $D$. In this work, we investigate coflow scheduling when the size of some of the requested data transfers may be small relative to the amount of data that can be transferred in one round. fractional matchings and/or that employ indirect routing, and compare the relative utility of these options. We design algorithms that perform much better for small demands than the algorithms in the literature that were designed for large data transfers."

    "abstract": "Brain tumors are among the most clinically significant neurological diseases and remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality due to their aggressive growth and structural heterogeneity. As tumors expand, they induce substantial anatomical deformation that disrupts both local tissue organization and global brain architecture, complicating diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. Yet a subject-specific reference of how the brain would appear without tumor-induced changes is fundamentally unobtainable in clinical practice. We present BrainNormalizer, an anatomy-informed diffusion framework that reconstructs pseudo-healthy MRIs directly from tumorous scans by conditioning the generative process on boundary cues extracted from the subject's own anatomy. This boundary-guided conditioning enables anatomically plausible pseudo-healthy reconstruction without requiring paired non-tumorous and tumorous scans. BrainNormalizer employs a two-stage training strategy. The pretrained diffusion model is first adapted through inpainting-based fine-tuning on tumorous and non-tumorous scans. Next, an edge-map-guided ControlNet branch is trained to inject fine-grained anatomical contours into the frozen decoder while preserving learned priors. During inference, a deliberate misalignment strategy pairs tumorous inputs with non-tumorous prompts and mirrored contralateral edge maps, leveraging hemispheric correspondence to guide reconstruction. On the BraTS2020 dataset, BrainNormalizer achieves strong quantitative performance and qualitatively produces anatomically plausible reconstructions in tumor-affected regions while retaining overall structural coherence. BrainNormalizer provides clinically reliable anatomical references for treatment planning and supports new research directions in counterfactual modeling and tumor-induced deformation analysis."

Using span-corruption pretraining and instruction-style fine-tuning on report polishing, paragraph summarization, and terminology question answering, NeuroLex learns the syntax and reasoning patterns characteristic of EEG interpretation. Comprehensive evaluations show that it achieves lower perplexity, higher extraction and summarization accuracy, better label efficiency, and improved robustness to negation and factual hallucination compared with general models of the same scale. With an EEG-aware linguistic backbone, NeuroLex bridges biomedical text modeling and brain-computer interface applications, offering a foundation for interpretable and language-driven neural decoding."

    "abstract": "Generative model-based imitation learning methods have recently achieved strong results in learning high-complexity motor skills from human demonstrations. However, imitation learning of interactive policies that coordinate with humans in shared spaces without explicit communication remains challenging, due to the significantly higher behavioral complexity in multi-agent interactions compared to non-interactive tasks. In this work, we introduce a structured imitation learning framework for interactive policies by combining generative single-agent policy learning with a flexible yet expressive game-theoretic structure. Our method explicitly separates learning into two steps: first, we learn individual behavioral patterns from multi-agent demonstrations using standard imitation learning; then, we structurally learn inter-agent dependencies by solving an inverse game problem. Preliminary results in a synthetic 5-agent social navigation task show that our method significantly improves non-interactive policies and performs comparably to the ground truth interactive policy using only 50 demonstrations. These results highlight the potential of structured imitation learning in interactive settings."

The effectiveness of many PPMs, particularly user-facing controls, depends on user awareness and adoption, which are shaped by manufacturers' public documentations. However, the landscape of academic proposals and commercial disclosures remains underexplored. To address this gap, we investigate: (1) What PPMs have academics proposed, and how are these PPMs evaluated? (2) What PPMs do manufacturers document and what factors affect these documentation? To address these questions, we conduct a two-phase study, synthesizing a systematic review of 117 academic papers with an empirical analysis of 86 SHDs' publicly disclosed documentations. Our review of academic literature reveals a strong focus on novel system- and algorithm-based PPMs. However, these proposals neglect deployment barriers (e.g., cost, interoperability), and lack real-world field validation and legal analysis. Concurrently, our analysis of commercial SHDs finds that advanced academic proposals are absent from public discourse. Industry postures are fundamentally reactive, prioritizing compliance via post-hoc data management (e.g., deletion options), rather than the preventative controls favored by academia. The documented protections correspondingly converge on a small set of practical mechanisms, such as physical buttons and localized processing. By synthesizing these findings, we advocate for research to analyze challenges, provide deployable frameworks, real-world field validation, and interoperability solutions to advance practical PPMs."

    "abstract": "The behaviour of internal waves propagating in a background shear flow is studied in the case where the direction of shear is orthogonal to gravity. Ray-tracing theory is used to predict properties of the wave state at locations where instability occurs. It is found that local wave energy growth may result from two distinct mechanisms: an increase in wave steepness due to refraction by the shear, or an increase in streamwise velocity perturbations due to wave advection of the background flow. Based on the initial conditions, a dimensionless parameter $F$ is constructed to predict the relative importance of these two mechanisms in facilitating wave-breaking according to the local ratio of perturbation kinetic to potential energy. When $F$ is small but wave amplitudes are locally large, energy remains equipartitioned and subsequent instabilities are expected to develop due to a combination of shear and convection. On the other hand, as $F$ increases, kinetic energy dominates and wave advection of momentum may instead cause breaking to become increasingly driven by enhanced vertical shear. To test these predictions, fully nonlinear direct numerical simulations are conducted, spanning a range of wave-breaking dynamics. Good qualitative agreement with the theory is found despite substantial departures from the underlying assumptions. Wave breaking leads to significant turbulent dissipation, which in some cases greatly exceeds the initial wave energy. Momentum and energy transfers between the wave, background flow and turbulence are found to be sensitive to the dynamics of breaking, as are the mixing properties."

The intricate dynamical behavior of these systems is a result of the dramatically reduced connectivity between many-body configurations.

Moreover, this mechanism supports the formation of characteristic elementary excitations, which we investigate here theoretically in a two-dimensional Rydberg lattice gas. We explore their properties as a function of interaction strength and range, and illustrate how they can be experimentally probed via sideband spectroscopy. Here, we show that the transition rate to certain delocalized superposition states of elementary excitations displays collective many-body enhancement."

Applying this approach to the model of De Nardi, French, and Jones (2010) with AHEAD data, we show that including gender and health histories in the discriminator improves identification and precision of bequests motives. The resulting estimates reveal that bequest motives explain between $13\\%$ and $19\\%$ percent of late-life savings across all permanent-income quintiles, not only among the rich. The adversarial estimator precisely disentangles bequest motives from precautionary savings motives.

We further demonstrate that the same antisymmetric generator arises in the adjoint action of any SU(2) unitary operator and fully determines the geometric phase of a qubit, independently of adiabaticity or cyclicity. This identifies a single algebraic structure underlying geometric phases in both classical and quantum two-level systems and provides an operational criterion for isolating geometric-phase contributions either directly from measured Mueller matrices (classical case) or from the adjoint action reconstructed by qubit process tomography"

    "abstract": "We present reproducible, edge-aware baselines for ogbn-proteins in PyTorch Geometric (PyG). We study two system choices that dominate practice: (i) how 8-dimensional edge evidence is aggregated into node inputs, and (ii) how edges are used inside message passing. Our strongest baseline is GraphSAGE with sum-based edge-to-node features. We compare LayerNorm (LN), BatchNorm (BN), and a species-aware Conditional LayerNorm (CLN), and report compute cost (time, VRAM, parameters) together with accuracy (ROC-AUC) and decision quality. In our primary experimental setup (hidden size 512, 3 layers, 3 seeds), sum consistently beats mean and max; BN attains the best AUC, while CLN matches the AUC frontier with better thresholded F1. Finally, post-hoc per-label temperature scaling plus per-label thresholds substantially improves micro-F1 and expected calibration error (ECE) with negligible AUC change, and light label-correlation smoothing yields small additional gains. We release standardized artifacts and scripts used for all of the runs presented in the paper."

    "abstract": "Contact-based grasp generation plays a crucial role in various applications. Recent methods typically focus on the geometric structure of objects, producing grasps with diverse hand poses and plausible contact points. However, these approaches often overlook the physical attributes of the grasp, specifically the contact force, leading to reduced stability of the grasp. In this paper, we focus on stable grasp generation using explicit contact force predictions. First, we define a force-aware contact representation by transforming the normal force value into discrete levels and encoding it using a one-hot vector. Next, we introduce force-aware stability constraints. We define the stability problem as an acceleration minimization task and explicitly relate stability with contact geometry by formulating the underlying physical constraints. Finally, we present a pose optimizer that systematically integrates our contact representation and stability constraints to enable stable grasp generation. We show that these constraints can help identify key contact points for stability which provide effective initialization and guidance for optimization towards a stable grasp. Experiments are carried out on two public benchmarks, showing that our method brings about 20% improvement in stability metrics and adapts well to novel objects."

We introduce De-VQA, a dynamic evaluation for visual question answering, uncovering a phenomenon we term transient blindness, overfitting to edit-similar text while ignoring visuals. Token analysis shows edits disproportionately affect textual tokens. We propose locality-aware adversarial losses to balance cross-modal representations. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines, reducing transient blindness and improving locality by 17% on average."

    "abstract": "This article presents the first systematic review of unsupervised and semi-supervised computational text-based ideal point estimation (CT-IPE) algorithms, methods designed to infer latent political positions from textual data. These algorithms are widely used in political science, communication, computational social science, and computer science to estimate ideological preferences from parliamentary speeches, party manifestos, and social media. Over the past two decades, their development has closely followed broader NLP trends -- beginning with word-frequency models and most recently turning to large language models (LLMs). While this trajectory has greatly expanded the methodological toolkit, it has also produced a fragmented field that lacks systematic comparison and clear guidance for applied use. To address this gap, we identified 25 CT-IPE algorithms through a systematic literature review and conducted a manual content analysis of their modeling assumptions and development contexts. To compare them meaningfully, we introduce a conceptual framework that distinguishes how algorithms generate, capture, and aggregate textual variance. On this basis, we identify four methodological families -- word-frequency, topic modeling, word embedding, and LLM-based approaches -- and critically assess their assumptions, interpretability, scalability, and limitations. Our review offers three contributions. First, it provides a structured synthesis of two decades of algorithm development, clarifying how diverse methods relate to one another. Second, it translates these insights into practical guidance for applied researchers, highlighting trade-offs in transparency, technical requirements, and validation strategies that shape algorithm choice. Third, it emphasizes that differences in estimation outcomes across algorithms are themselves informative, underscoring the need for systematic benchmarking."

To address this, we propose CONFETTI, a novel multi-objective CE method for MTS. CONFETTI identifies key MTS subsequences, locates a counterfactual target, and optimally modifies the time series to balance prediction confidence, proximity and sparsity. This method provides actionable insights with minimal changes, improving interpretability, and decision support. CONFETTI is evaluated on seven MTS datasets from the UEA archive, demonstrating its effectiveness in various domains. CONFETTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CE methods in its optimization objectives, and in six other metrics from the literature, achieving $\\geq10\\%$ higher confidence while improving sparsity in $\\geq40\\%$."

We propose a two-step procedure to estimate the fixed and random components of the model, relying on a functional version of the Iterative Reweighted Least Squares algorithm. We investigate the asymptotic properties of both fixed and random components, and we assess the performance of the proposed model through a simulation study, comparing it with state-of-the-art alternatives from the literature. The proposed methodology is finally applied to the study of hourly nitrogen dioxide concentration data in Lombardy (Italy), using random effects to account for measurement heterogeneity across monitoring stations equipped with different sensor technologies."

It captures Uplink (UL) Sounding Reference Signals (SRS), and requires virtually no coordination with the network infrastructure. A complete signal processing chain is proposed and developed, encompassing synchronization, user identification, and localization, all executed onboard UAV during flight. The system autonomously plans and adapts its mission workflow to estimate multiple user positions within a single deployment, integrating flight control with real-time sensing. Extensive simulations and a full-scale low- altitude experimental campaign validate the approach, showing localization errors below 3 m in rural field tests and below 8 m in urban simulation scenarios, while reliably identifying each user. The results confirm the feasibility of infrastructure-independent sensing UAVs as a core element of the emerging Low Altitude Economy (LAE), supporting situational awareness and rapid deployment in emergency or connectivity-limited environments."

We observed that Mamba-based models, with their linear state-space design, capture long-range dependencies at lower cost, offering a promising balance between efficiency and accuracy. However, existing methods rely on axis-aligned scanning within a fixed window, inevitably discarding spatial information. To address this problem, we propose WinMamba, a novel Mamba-based 3D feature-encoding backbone composed of stacked WinMamba blocks. To enhance the backbone with robust multi-scale representation, the WinMamba block incorporates a window-scale-adaptive module that compensates voxel features across varying resolutions during sampling. Meanwhile, to obtain rich contextual cues within the linear state space, we equip the WinMamba layer with a learnable positional encoding and a window-shift strategy. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate that WinMamba significantly outperforms the baseline. Ablation studies further validate the individual contributions of the WSF and AWF modules in improving detection accuracy. The code will be made publicly available."

Despite the growing interest, existing medical visual benchmarks present notable limitations. They often rely on ambiguous queries that lack sufficient relevance to image content, oversimplify complex diagnostic reasoning into closed-ended shortcuts, and adopt a text-centric evaluation paradigm that overlooks the importance of image generation capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce \\textsc{MedGEN-Bench}, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark designed to advance medical AI research. MedGEN-Bench comprises 6,422 expert-validated image-text pairs spanning six imaging modalities, 16 clinical tasks, and 28 subtasks. It is structured into three distinct formats: Visual Question Answering, Image Editing, and Contextual Multimodal Generation. What sets MedGEN-Bench apart is its focus on contextually intertwined instructions that necessitate sophisticated cross-modal reasoning and open-ended generative outputs, moving beyond the constraints of multiple-choice formats. To evaluate the performance of existing systems, we employ a novel three-tier assessment framework that integrates pixel-level metrics, semantic text analysis, and expert-guided clinical relevance scoring. Using this framework, we systematically assess 10 compositional frameworks, 3 unified models, and 5 VLMs."

Existing adversarial evaluations often rely on perturbations that manifest as unusual textures rarely encountered in everyday indoor environments. Errors under such contrived conditions have limited practical relevance, as real-world agents are unlikely to encounter such artificial patterns. In this work, we focus on indoor lighting, an intrinsic yet largely overlooked scene attribute that strongly influences navigation. We propose Indoor Lighting-based Adversarial Attack (ILA), a black-box framework that manipulates global illumination to disrupt VLN agents. Motivated by typical household lighting usage, we design two attack modes: Static Indoor Lighting-based Attack (SILA), where the lighting intensity remains constant throughout an episode, and Dynamic Indoor Lighting-based Attack (DILA), where lights are switched on or off at critical moments to induce abrupt illumination changes. We evaluate ILA on two state-of-the-art VLN models across three navigation tasks. Results show that ILA significantly increases failure rates while reducing trajectory efficiency, revealing previously unrecognized vulnerabilities of VLN agents to realistic indoor lighting variations."

    "abstract": "Predicting single-cell perturbation outcomes directly advances gene function analysis and facilitates drug candidate selection, making it a key driver of both basic and translational biomedical research. However, a major bottleneck in this task is the unpaired nature of single-cell data, as the same cell cannot be observed both before and after perturbation due to the destructive nature of sequencing. Although some neural generative transport models attempt to tackle unpaired single-cell perturbation data, they either lack explicit conditioning or depend on prior spaces for indirect distribution alignment, limiting precise perturbation modeling. In this work, we approximate Schrödinger Bridge (SB), which defines stochastic dynamic mappings recovering the entropy-regularized optimal transport (OT), to directly align the distributions of control and perturbed single-cell populations across different perturbation conditions. Unlike prior SB approximations that rely on bidirectional modeling to infer optimal source-target sample coupling, we leverage Minibatch-OT based pairing to avoid such bidirectional inference and the associated ill-posedness of defining the reverse process. This pairing directly guides bridge learning, yielding a scalable approximation to the SB. We approximate two SB models, one modeling discrete gene activation states and the other continuous expression distributions. Joint training enables accurate perturbation modeling and captures single-cell heterogeneity. Experiments on public genetic and drug perturbation datasets show that our model effectively captures heterogeneous single-cell responses and achieves state-of-the-art performance."

In order to study reproducibility and scalability, a parametric design framework establishes deterministic rules linking actuator chamber dimensions to lattice unit cell size. Experimental homogenization of lattice specimens provides effective material properties for finite element simulation. Within this simulation environment, sensor placement is treated as a discrete optimization problem, where a finite set of candidate waveguide paths derived from lattice nodes is evaluated by introducing local stiffening, and the configuration minimizing deviation from baseline mechanical response is selected. Optimized models are fabricated and experimentally characterized, validating the preservation of mechanical performance while enabling embedded sensing. The workflow is further extended to scaled units and a two-finger gripper, demonstrating generality of the MU concept. This approach advances monolithic soft robotic design by combining reproducible co-design rules with simulation-informed sensor integration."

However, existing methods may encounter challenges when handling point clouds with changes in orientation and position because the resulting features may vary significantly. To address this problem, we propose a novel Rotationally Invariant Features (RIF) framework for 3D AD. Firstly, to remove the adverse effect of variations on point cloud data, we develop a Point Coordinate Mapping (PCM) technique, which maps each point into a rotationally invariant space to maintain consistency of representation. Then, to learn robust and discriminative features, we design a lightweight Convolutional Transform Feature Network (CTF-Net) to extract rotationally invariant features for the memory bank. To improve the ability of the feature extractor, we introduce the idea of transfer learning to pre-train the feature extractor with 3D data augmentation. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the advanced performance on the Anomaly-ShapeNet dataset, with an average P-AUROC improvement of 17.7\\%, and also gains the best performance on the Real3D-AD dataset, with an average P-AUROC improvement of 1.6\\%.

They exist to identify extraterrestrial neutrino sources and to probe fundamental questions pertaining to the elusive neutrino itself. A central challenge common across neutrino telescopes is to solve a series of inverse problems known as event reconstruction, which seeks to resolve properties of the incident neutrino, based on the detected Cherenkov light. In recent times, significant efforts have been made in adapting advances from deep learning research to event reconstruction, as such techniques provide several benefits over traditional methods. While a large degree of similarity in reconstruction needs and low-level data exists, cross-experimental collaboration has been hindered by a lack of diverse open-source datasets for comparing methods. We present NuBench, an open benchmark for deep learning-based event reconstruction in neutrino telescopes. NuBench comprises seven large-scale simulated datasets containing nearly 130 million charged- and neutral-current muon-neutrino interactions spanning 10 GeV to 100 TeV, generated across six detector geometries inspired by existing and proposed experiments. These datasets provide pulse- and event-level information suitable for developing and comparing machine-learning reconstruction methods in both water and ice environments. Using NuBench, we evaluate four reconstruction algorithms - ParticleNeT and DynEdge, both actively used within the KM3NeT and IceCube collaborations, respectively, along with GRIT and DeepIce - on up to five core tasks: energy and direction reconstruction, topology classification, interaction vertex prediction, and inelasticity estimation."

    "abstract": "Autonomous underwater vehicles rely on precise navigation systems that combine the inertial navigation system and the Doppler velocity log for successful missions in challenging environments where satellite navigation is unavailable. The effectiveness of this integration critically depends on accurate alignment between the sensor reference frames. Standard model-based alignment methods between these sensor systems suffer from lengthy convergence times, dependence on prescribed motion patterns, and reliance on external aiding sensors, significantly limiting operational flexibility. To address these limitations, this paper presents ResAlignNet, a data-driven approach using the 1D ResNet-18 architecture that transforms the alignment problem into deep neural network optimization, operating as an in-situ solution that requires only sensors on board without external positioning aids or complex vehicle maneuvers, while achieving rapid convergence in seconds. Additionally, the approach demonstrates the learning capabilities of Sim2Real transfer, enabling training in synthetic data while deploying in operational sensor measurements. Experimental validation using the Snapir autonomous underwater vehicle demonstrates that ResAlignNet achieves alignment accuracy within 0.8° using only 25 seconds of data collection, representing a 65\\% reduction in convergence time compared to standard velocity-based methods. The trajectory-independent solution eliminates motion pattern requirements and enables immediate vehicle deployment without lengthy pre-mission procedures, advancing underwater navigation capabilities through robust sensor-agnostic alignment that scales across different operational scenarios and sensor specifications."

Consider the Langevin diffusion on $\\R^d$ \\begin{align*} \\dif X_t=-\\nabla U(X_t)dt+\\sqrt{2}dB_t, \\end{align*} under mild conditions, it admits $π(\\dif x)\\propto \\exp(-U(x))\\dif x$ as its unique stationary distribution. Recently, Kandasamy and Nagaraj (2024) introduced a stochastic algorithm called Poisson Randomized Midpoint Langevin Monte Carlo (PRLMC) to enhance the rate of convergence towards the target distribution $π$. In this paper, we first show that under mild conditions, the PRLMC, as a Markov chain, admits a unique stationary distribution $π_η$ ($η$ is the step size) and obtain the convergence rate of PRLMC to $π_η$ in total variation distance. Then we establish a sharp error bound between $π_η$ and $π$ under the 2-Wasserstein distance. Finally, we propose a decreasing-step size version of PRLMC and provide its convergence rate to $π$ which is nearly optimal."

    "abstract": "Modular design of planning-oriented autonomous driving has markedly advanced end-to-end systems. However, existing architectures remain constrained by an over-reliance on ego status, hindering generalization and robust scene understanding. We identify the root cause as an inherent design within these architectures that allows ego status to be easily leveraged as a shortcut. Specifically, the premature fusion of ego status in the upstream BEV encoder allows an information flow from this strong prior to dominate the downstream planning module. To address this challenge, we propose AdaptiveAD, an architectural-level solution based on a multi-context fusion strategy. Its core is a dual-branch structure that explicitly decouples scene perception and ego status. One branch performs scene-driven reasoning based on multi-task learning, but with ego status deliberately omitted from the BEV encoder, while the other conducts ego-driven reasoning based solely on the planning task. A scene-aware fusion module then adaptively integrates the complementary decisions from the two branches to form the final planning trajectory. To ensure this decoupling does not compromise multi-task learning, we introduce a path attention mechanism for ego-BEV interaction and add two targeted auxiliary tasks: BEV unidirectional distillation and autoregressive online mapping. Extensive evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that AdaptiveAD achieves state-of-the-art open-loop planning performance. Crucially, it significantly mitigates the over-reliance on ego status and exhibits impressive generalization capabilities across diverse scenarios."

We present EMSGlass, a smart-glasses system powered by EMSNet, the first multimodal multitask model for Emergency Medical Services (EMS), and EMSServe, a low-latency multimodal serving framework tailored to EMS scenarios. EMSNet integrates text, vital signs, and scene images to construct a unified real-time understanding of EMS incidents. Trained on real-world multimodal EMS datasets, EMSNet simultaneously supports up to five critical EMS tasks with superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art unimodal baselines. Built on top of PyTorch, EMSServe introduces a modality-aware model splitter and a feature caching mechanism, achieving adaptive and efficient inference across heterogeneous hardware while addressing the challenge of asynchronous modality arrival in the field. By optimizing multimodal inference execution in EMS scenarios, EMSServe achieves 1.9x -- 11.7x speedup over direct PyTorch multimodal inference. A user study evaluation with six professional EMTs demonstrates that EMSGlass enhances real-time situational awareness, decision-making speed, and operational efficiency through intuitive on-glass interaction. In addition, qualitative insights from the user study provide actionable directions for extending EMSGlass toward next-generation AI-enabled EMS systems, bridging multimodal intelligence with real-world emergency response workflows."

With the rapid development of intelligent and environmentally friendly trends, higher requirements have been imposed on HST control systems regarding operational efficiency, control accuracy, and adaptability to working conditions. This study focuses on a forklift truck drive system equipped with a dual variable-displacement pump-motor assembly. A mathematical model of the HST system was constructed, with detailed analysis of each stage during vehicle acceleration. A power matching strategy was proposed to enhance dynamic performance, whose core concept consisted of three elements: 1) correlating the driver's pedal signal with the target engine speed of the diesel engine, 2) dynamically adjusting motor displacement to maximize acceleration capability, and 3) coordinating pump displacement variations. Furthermore, a dynamic compensation mechanism for control variables was introduced to improve system responsiveness. The controller was evaluated under multiple operating conditions, with results demonstrating superior acceleration performance, rapid response, and precise control characteristics. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy and its robust load adaptability in hydrostatic drive systems."

The generative and adaptive nature complicates how human oversight and responsibility are specified, delegated, and traced. Existing requirements engineering (RE) approaches remain limited in addressing these phenomena, revealing conceptual, methodological, and artifact-level research gaps.. Objective: This study aims to analyze these research gaps in the context of GenAI-enabled software systems. It seeks to establish a coherent perspective for a systematic analysis of responsibility gaps from a human oversight requirements standpoint, encompassing how these responsibility gaps should be conceptualized, identified, and represented throughout the RE process. Methods: The proposed design methodology is structured across three analytical layers. At the conceptualization layer, it establishes a conceptual framing that defines the key elements of responsibility across the human and system dimensions and explains how potential responsibility gaps emerge from their interactions. At the methodological layer, it introduces a deductive pipeline for identifying responsibility gaps by analyzing interactions between these dimensions and deriving corresponding oversight requirements within established RE frameworks. At the artifact layer, it formalizes the results in a Deductive Backbone Table, a reusable representation that traces the reasoning path from responsibility gaps identification to human oversight requirements derivation. Results: A user study compared the proposed methodology with a baseline goal-oriented RE across two scenarios. Evaluation across six dimensions indicated clear improvements of the proposed methodology, confirming its effectiveness in addressing three research gaps."

    "abstract": "Kernel-based learning methods can dramatically increase the storage capacity of Hopfield networks, yet the dynamical mechanism behind this enhancement remains poorly understood. We address this gap by conducting a geometric analysis of the network's energy landscape. We introduce a novel metric, ``Pinnacle Sharpness,'' to quantify the local stability of attractors. By systematically varying the kernel width and storage load, we uncover a rich phase diagram of attractor shapes. Our central finding is the emergence of a ``ridge of optimization,'' where the network maximizes attractor stability under challenging high-load and global-kernel conditions. Through a theoretical decomposition of the landscape gradient into a direct ``driving'' force and an indirect ``feedback'' force, we reveal the origin of this phenomenon. The optimization ridge corresponds to a regime of strong anti-correlation between the two forces, where the direct force, amplified by the high storage load, dominates the opposing collective feedback force. This demonstrates a sophisticated self-organization mechanism: the network adaptively harnesses inter-pattern interactions as a cooperative feedback control system to sculpt a robust energy landscape. Our findings provide a new physical picture for the stability of high-capacity associative memories and offer principles for their design."

    "abstract": "Language models (LMs) are often adapted through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to specialize their capabilities for downstream tasks. However, in typical scenarios where the fine-tuning data is limited, e.g., compared to pre-training, SFT can lead LMs to overfit, causing them to rely on spurious patterns within the target task or to compromise other broadly useful capabilities as a side effect of narrow specialization. In this paper, we propose Learning-from-the-Undesirable (LfU), a simple yet effective regularization scheme for SFT to mitigate overfitting issues when fine-tuning LMs with limited data. Specifically, we aim to regularize the fine-tuning process to favor solutions that are resilient to \"undesirable\" model updates, e.g., gradient ascent steps that steer the model toward undesirable behaviors. To this end, we propose a novel form of consistency regularization that directly aligns internal representations of the model with those after an undesirable update. By leveraging representation-level data augmentation through undesirable updates, LfU effectively promotes generalization under limited data. Our experiments on diverse LM downstream tasks show that LfU serves as an effective prior that enhances adaptability while preserving pretrained knowledge. For example, our LM from LfU achieves a 16.8% average improvement on math tasks compared to vanilla SFT on the same dataset, where the latter even leads to degraded performance on those tasks. Furthermore, LfU exhibits improved robustness to prompt variations, e.g., yielding a 92.1% lower standard deviation in output performances compared to SFT, highlighting its versatile effects."

    "abstract": "Today's denoising diffusion models do not \"denoise\" in the classical sense, i.e., they do not directly predict clean images. Rather, the neural networks predict noise or a noised quantity. In this paper, we suggest that predicting clean data and predicting noised quantities are fundamentally different. According to the manifold assumption, natural data should lie on a low-dimensional manifold, whereas noised quantities do not. With this assumption, we advocate for models that directly predict clean data, which allows apparently under-capacity networks to operate effectively in very high-dimensional spaces. We show that simple, large-patch Transformers on pixels can be strong generative models: using no tokenizer, no pre-training, and no extra loss. Our approach is conceptually nothing more than \"$\\textbf{Just image Transformers}$\", or $\\textbf{JiT}$, as we call it. We report competitive results using JiT with large patch sizes of 16 and 32 on ImageNet at resolutions of 256 and 512, where predicting high-dimensional noised quantities can fail catastrophically. With our networks mapping back to the basics of the manifold, our research goes back to basics and pursues a self-contained paradigm for Transformer-based diffusion on raw natural data."

We take a principled approach to constructing high-performing and robust spatial intelligence by systematically curating SenseNova-SI-8M: eight million diverse data samples under a rigorous taxonomy of spatial capabilities. SenseNova-SI demonstrates unprecedented performance across a broad range of spatial intelligence benchmarks: 68.7% on VSI-Bench, 43.3% on MMSI, 85.6% on MindCube, 54.6% on ViewSpatial, and 50.1% on SITE, while maintaining strong general multimodal understanding (e.g., 84.9% on MMBench-En). More importantly, we analyze the impact of data scaling, discuss early signs of emergent generalization capabilities enabled by diverse data training, analyze the risk of overfitting and language shortcuts, present a preliminary study on spatial chain-of-thought reasoning, and validate the potential downstream application. SenseNova-SI is an ongoing project, and this report will be updated continuously.

    "abstract": "M dwarfs are magnetically active stars that frequently produce flares, which have implications for both stellar evolution and exoplanet studies. Flare occurrence rates and activity levels of M dwarfs correlate with stellar characteristics such as age, mass, and rotation period. We search TESS observations of a known active population of M dwarfs as well as a volume-limited sample of M dwarfs within 15 parsecs. We detect flares in the light curves of these stars, including 276 of 538 M dwarfs within 15 pc, and calculate cumulative flare frequency distributions (FFDs) for each star. Based on flaring behavior, we categorize stars into relatively higher and lower activity groups and fit power laws to their FFDs to compare the power law exponent ($α$) across activity levels. We find $α=1.99 \\pm 0.07$ for the combined FFD of the lower activity M dwarfs, compared to averages of $α= 1.94 \\pm 0.58$ for highly active stars with 10-100 detected flares, and $α= 2.03 \\pm 0.43$ for those with > 100 detected flares, suggesting little evolution in the power law distribution of flares as M dwarfs transition from high to low activity states. The uncertainties for the active star groups reflect the standard deviation of $α$ values across individual stars within each subset. Because stellar flares and associated stellar activity complicate exoplanet observations, we also examine the subset of M dwarfs with JWST transmission spectroscopy follow-up observations in Cycles 1-3. The flares we detect for these targets are consistent with the broader 15 pc sample, providing context for interpreting planetary atmosphere retrievals from JWST spectra."

If confirmed at galaxy formation forbidden efficiencies, these galaxies could signal new physics beyond standard cosmological structure formation. We develop a galaxy model framework that ties the linear power spectrum to the inferred efficiencies of galaxy growth in order to test the structure formation models. In addition, we incorporate multiple sources of error, including (i) observational sample variance, (ii) asymmetric scatter induced by the steepness of the high-mass halo tail, and (iii) systematic uncertainties in stellar mass estimates. We find that the inferred efficiency of star formation is dominated by systematic uncertainties on the spectral energy distribution inferred stellar mass of the JWST detected galaxies. The systematic uncertainty augments the asymmetry in scatter that largely brings the inferred efficiencies to be in line with that expected from early galaxy formation models. Our framework can be used to test $Λ$CDM as errors are reduced and further detections are made."

However, despite recent breakthroughs such as Veo 3's chain-of-frames reasoning, it remains unclear whether these models can exhibit reasoning capabilities similar to large language models (LLMs). Existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate visual fidelity and temporal coherence, failing to capture higher-order reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we propose TiViBench, a hierarchical benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of image-to-video (I2V) generation models. TiViBench systematically assesses reasoning across four dimensions: i) Structural Reasoning & Search, ii) Spatial & Visual Pattern Reasoning, iii) Symbolic & Logical Reasoning, and iv) Action Planning & Task Execution, spanning 24 diverse task scenarios across 3 difficulty levels. Through extensive evaluations, we show that commercial models (e.g., Sora 2, Veo 3.1) demonstrate stronger reasoning potential, while open-source models reveal untapped potential that remains hindered by limited training scale and data diversity. To further unlock this potential, we introduce VideoTPO, a simple yet effective test-time strategy inspired by preference optimization. By performing LLM self-analysis on generated candidates to identify strengths and weaknesses, VideoTPO significantly enhances reasoning performance without requiring additional training, data, or reward models. Together, TiViBench and VideoTPO pave the way for evaluating and advancing reasoning in video generation models, setting a foundation for future research in this emerging field."

    "abstract": "Understanding the principles that govern dynamical systems is a central challenge across many scientific domains, including biology and ecology. Incomplete knowledge of nonlinear interactions and stochastic effects often renders bottom-up modeling approaches ineffective, motivating the development of methods that can discover governing equations directly from data. In such contexts, parametric models often struggle without strong prior knowledge, especially when estimating intrinsic noise. Nonetheless, incorporating stochastic effects is often essential for understanding the dynamic behavior of complex systems such as gene regulatory networks and signaling pathways. To address these challenges, we introduce Trine (Three-phase Regression for INtrinsic noisE), a nonparametric, kernel-based framework that infers state-dependent intrinsic noise from time-series data. Trine features a three-stage algorithm that com- bines analytically solvable subproblems with a structured kernel architecture that captures both abrupt noise-driven fluctuations and smooth, state-dependent changes in variance. We validate Trine on biological and ecological systems, demonstrating its ability to uncover hidden dynamics without relying on predefined parametric assumptions. Across several benchmark problems, Trine achieves performance comparable to that of an oracle. Biologically, this oracle can be viewed as an idealized observer capable of directly tracking the random fluctuations in molecular concentrations or reaction events within a cell. The Trine framework thus opens new avenues for understanding how intrinsic noise affects the behavior of complex systems."

However, its layered meanings, cultural allusions, and sophisticated grammatical constructions often pose challenges for comprehension, especially for non-native speakers or readers unfamiliar with its context and language. Despite its cultural significance, existing works on poetry have largely overlooked Indian language poems. In this paper, we propose the Translation and Image Generation (TAI) framework, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Latent Diffusion Models through appropriate prompt tuning. Our framework supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of Quality Education (SDG 4) and Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10) by enhancing the accessibility of culturally rich Indian-language poetry to a global audience. It includes (1) a translation module that uses an Odds Ratio Preference Alignment Algorithm to accurately translate morphologically rich poetry into English, and (2) an image generation module that employs a semantic graph to capture tokens, dependencies, and semantic relationships between metaphors and their meanings, to create visually meaningful representations of Indian poems. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation, including both human and quantitative assessments, demonstrates the superiority of TAI Diffusion in poem image generation tasks, outperforming strong baselines. To further address the scarcity of resources for Indian-language poetry, we introduce the Morphologically Rich Indian Language Poems MorphoVerse Dataset, comprising 1,570 poems across 21 low-resource Indian languages.

The area of this surface is expressed through the eigenvalues of the Douglas-Gram matrix of the boundary loop, and is identical for the self-dual and anti-self-dual chiralities related by parity. We prove the Confinement Theorem by showing that the effective string tension sigma_eff[C] (ratio of our Hodge dual area to a Euclidean one bounded by the same loop) is bounded as sigma_eff[C]>= sqrt(2) , remaining finite and positive for all regular loops. Consequently, the Wilson loop decays exponentially with the Euclidean area, providing a purely geometric proof of confinement. Quantization of the quadratic holomorphic action yields a quantum string, with a universal constant correction for each of the two chiral strings. The worldsheet theory is one-loop exact. This construction defines a solvable quantum Hodge-dual string theory reproducing the QCD area law with explicit tension dependence on the loop shape."

    "abstract": "We introduce GS-Light, an efficient, textual position-aware pipeline for text-guided relighting of 3D scenes represented via Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). GS-Light implements a training-free extension of a single-input diffusion model to handle multi-view inputs. Given a user prompt that may specify lighting direction, color, intensity, or reference objects, we employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to parse the prompt into lighting priors. Using off-the-shelf estimators for geometry and semantics (depth, surface normals, and semantic segmentation), we fuse these lighting priors with view-geometry constraints to compute illumination maps and generate initial latent codes for each view. These meticulously derived init latents guide the diffusion model to generate relighting outputs that more accurately reflect user expectations, especially in terms of lighting direction. By feeding multi-view rendered images, along with the init latents, into our multi-view relighting model, we produce high-fidelity, artistically relit images. Finally, we fine-tune the 3DGS scene with the relit appearance to obtain a fully relit 3D scene. We evaluate GS-Light on both indoor and outdoor scenes, comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines including per-view relighting, video relighting, and scene editing methods. Using quantitative metrics (multi-view consistency, imaging quality, aesthetic score, semantic similarity, etc.) and qualitative assessment (user studies), GS-Light demonstrates consistent improvements over baselines.

Here we directly excite phonon modes in a weakly interacting 1D Bose gas and study their time evolution. In the linear response regime, damping is surprisingly fast and quantitatively follows the non-analytic scaling predicted by Andreev's hydrodynamic description. For stronger excitations, we observe a crossover to a highly nonlinear regime characterized by wave breaking, captured by the finite-temperature nonlinear Schrödinger evolution. Our results resolve a long-standing question on the fate of phonons in 1D Bose gases, and open new pathways to study non-linear relaxation in quantum many-body systems."

To elucidate the methodology, we examine two popular runs- and patterns-type statistics: the number of success runs and the scan statistic. Numerical results indicate that the performance of our proposed control charts is comparable to that of existing Phase I nonparametric control charts for individual observations."

Grounded in contingency theory and quality theory, the study examines the role of P-AI fit in managerial decision-making through a proof-of-concept case study involving a real hiring process for a Senior AI Lead. Three decision pathways are compared: (1) independent evaluations by a CEO, CTO, and CSO; (2) an evaluation produced by an augmented human-AI symbiotic intelligence system (H3LIX-LAIZA); and (3) an assessment generated by a general-purpose large language model. The results reveal substantial role-based divergence in human judgments, high alignment between H3LIX-LAIZA and the CEOs implicit decision model-including ethical disqualification of a high-risk candidate and a critical false-positive recommendation from the LLMr. The findings demonstrate that higher P-AI fit, exemplified by the CEO H3LIX-LAIZA relationship, functions as a mechanism linking augmented symbiotic intelligence to accurate, trustworthy, and context-sensitive decisions. The study provides an initial verification of the P-AI fit construct and a proof-of-concept for H3LIX-LAIZA as an augmented human-AI symbiotic intelligence system."

    "abstract": "Combined measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia), have recently challenged the $Λ$-Cold Dark Matter ($Λ$CDM) paradigm, indicating potential evidence for a dynamical dark energy component. These results are usually obtained in the context of the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameterizations, generally implying in phantom-crossing at intermediate redshifts. However, a general mapping between these parameterizations that yields approximately the same background observables clouds the inference of the true nature of dark energy in the context of these parametric methods. In this work, we propose a model-independent reconstruction of the dark energy density, which is more directly constrained than its EoS, based on the Gaussian Process (GP) regression method with the use of DESI DR2 BAO data and the Pantheon+, Union3 and DESY5 SN Ia samples. In addition, we perform a statistical comparison between the energy densities of $Λ$, a non-phantom thawing quintessence-type dark energy, and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterization with the reconstructed function. We find that all models agree with the GP reconstruction at 95\\% C.L., with the largest discrepancy coming from $Λ$CDM with DESY5 at low redshifts. Even in this case, our findings suggest that it may be premature to claim statistically significant evidence for evolving or phantom dark energy with current DESI and SN Ia measurements."

Motivated by sub-transmission operations at RTE, this paper considers the Optimal Transmission Switching with De-energization (OTSD), which captures potential loss of connectivity (and therefore localized blackout) following loss of transmission elements. While directly relevant to real-life operations, this problem has received very little attention in the literature. The paper proposes a new mixed-integer linear programming formulation for OTSD that represents post-contingency loss of connectivity without requiring additional binary variables. This new formulation provides the foundation for a fast, iterative heuristic algorithm. Computational experiments confirms that state-of-the-art optimization solvers struggle to solve the extensive formulation of OTSD, often failing to find even trivial solutions within reasonable time. In contrast, numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed heuristic, which finds high-quality feasible solutions 100-1000x faster than using Gurobi."

Machine learning classifiers can learn from large amounts of training examples to effectively distinguish deceptive reviews from genuine ones. However, the distinguishing features learned by these classifiers are often subtle, fragmented, and difficult for humans to interpret. In this work, we explore using large language models (LLMs) to translate machine-learned lexical cues into human-understandable language phenomena that can differentiate deceptive reviews from genuine ones. We show that language phenomena obtained in this manner are empirically grounded in data, generalizable across similar domains, and more predictive than phenomena either in LLMs' prior knowledge or obtained through in-context learning. These language phenomena have the potential to aid people in critically assessing the credibility of online reviews in environments where deception detection classifiers are unavailable."

    "abstract": "Fault tolerant quantum computation over distributed quantum computing (DQC) platforms requires careful evaluation of resource requirements and noise thresholds. As quantum hardware advances toward modular and networked architectures, various fault tolerant DQC schemes have been proposed, which can be broadly categorized into three architectural types. Type 1 architectures consist of small quantum nodes connected via Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, enabling nonlocal stabilizer measurements. Type 2 architectures distribute a large error correcting code block across multiple modules, with most stabilizer measurements remaining local, except for a small subset at patch boundaries that are performed using nonlocal CNOT gates. Type 3 architectures assign code blocks to distinct modules and can perform fault tolerant operations such as transversal gates, lattice surgery, and teleportation to implement logical operations between code blocks. Using the planar surface code and toric code as representative examples, we analyze how the resource requirements, particularly the number of Bell pairs and the average number of generation attempts, scale with increasing code distance across different architectural designs. This analysis provides valuable insights for identifying architectures well suited to fault tolerant distributed quantum computation under near term hardware and resource constraints."

We find that the quantum isochoric cycle achieves a higher efficiency than both classical counterparts and also surpasses the efficiency of the recently proposed three-stroke quantum isoenergetic cycle. Owing to its reduced number of strokes, the design substantially lowers control complexity in nanoscale thermodynamic devices, offering a more feasible route to experimental realization compared to conventional four-stroke architectures. We further evaluate the cycle in graphene-based systems under an external magnetic field, including monolayer graphene (MLG), AB-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG), and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at both magic and non-magic twist angles. Among these platforms, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) attains the highest efficiency at fixed work output, highlighting its promise for quantum thermodynamic applications."

This structured output serves as a versatile interface to drive downstream geometry-aware modules for part-based generation and editing. By decoupling the symbolic planning from the geometric synthesis, our approach allows any compatible geometry engine to be controlled through a single, language-native frontend. We pre-train a dual-encoder architecture to disentangle structure from semantics and instruction-tune the model on a large-scale, part-centric dataset.

We introduce CacheFlow, a training-free pipeline that pairs Dynamic Token Dropping (DTD) with a compressive long-term memory. DTD prunes per-patch tokens online via cosine similarity to the previous frame, and surviving tokens are packed into fixed-size blocks. This online, per-frame processing makes our approach fundamentally suited for live streaming VQA. As blocks are processed, each one's keys are summarized by a tiny recurrent encoder to form a retrieval index, while the block's full KV pairs are offloaded and later rehydrated for generation, preserving answer fidelity. At inference, a consensus-based retrieval mechanism retrieves only the Top-K most relevant blocks and attends over both the retrieved and local context for precise, long-range reasoning. CacheFlow is drop-in, architecture-agnostic, and requires no fine-tuning. Experiments on both offline and streaming VQA benchmarks demonstrate that CacheFlow outperforms current strong baselines, while processing up to 87% less tokens. Our dual approach enables VLMs to be both efficient and context-aware, paving the way for practical long-form video understanding."

Moreover, we give order-of-magnitude arguments showing that GEM quadratic quasinormal modes (QQNMs) can become relevant in a range of charged and magnetized astrophysical scenarios. Finally, we show through a brief dilaton-theory example that the GEM QQNM spectrum is sensitive to how gravity couples to electromagnetism, thereby providing a model-based way to test minimal coupling and to constrain hidden $U(1)$ sectors with gravitational-wave observations."

Each rate coefficient has an associated uncertainty, which is generally not taken into account when calculating the chemistry. We performed the first uncertainty analysis of a chemical model of C-rich and O-rich AGB outflows using the Rate22 reaction network. Quantifying the error on the model predictions enables us to determine the need for adding complexity to the model. Using a Monte Carlo sampling method, we quantified the impact of the uncertainties on the chemical kinetic data on the predicted fractional abundances and column densities. The errors are caused by a complex interplay of reactions forming and destroying each species. Parent species show an error on their envelope sizes, which is not caused by the uncertainty on their photodissociation rate, but rather the chemistry reforming the parent after its photodissociation. Using photodissociation models to estimate the envelope size might be an oversimplification. The error on the CO envelope impacts retrieved mass-loss rates by up to a factor of two. For daughter species, the error on the peak fractional abundance ranges from a factor of a few to three orders of magnitude, and is on average about 10\\% of its value. This error is positively correlated with the error on the column density. The standard model suffices for many species, e.g., the radial distribution of cyanopolyynes and hydrocarbon radicals around IRC +10216. However, including spherical asymmetries, dust-gas chemistry, and photochemistry induced by a close-by stellar companion are still necessary to explain certain observations."

A major computational bottleneck arises in acquisition function optimization, where multi-start optimization (MSO) with quasi-Newton (QN) methods is required due to the non-convexity of the acquisition function. BoTorch, a widely used BO library, currently optimizes the summed acquisition function over multiple points, leading to the speedup of MSO owing to PyTorch batching. Nevertheless, this paper empirically demonstrates the suboptimality of this approach in terms of off-diagonal approximation errors in the inverse Hessian of a QN method, slowing down its convergence. To address this problem, we propose to decouple QN updates using a coroutine while batching the acquisition function calls. Our approach not only yields the theoretically identical convergence to the sequential MSO but also drastically reduces the wall-clock time compared to the previous approaches."

Recently introduced $α$-divergence loss functions offer a compelling alternative, particularly for their ability to induce sparse solutions (when $α>1$). However, integrating an angular margin-crucial for verification tasks-is not straightforward. We find this integration can be achieved in at least two distinct ways: via the reference measure (prior probabilities) or via the logits (unnormalized log-likelihoods). In this paper, we explore both pathways, deriving two novel margin-based $α$-divergence losses: Q-Margin (margin in the reference measure) and A3M (margin in the logits). We identify and address a critical training instability in A3M-caused by the interplay of penalized logits and sparsity-with a simple yet effective prototype re-initialization strategy. Our methods achieve significant performance gains on the challenging IJB-B and IJB-C face verification benchmarks. We demonstrate similarly strong performance in speaker verification on VoxCeleb. Crucially, our models significantly outperform strong baselines at low false acceptance rates (FAR). This capability is crucial for practical high-security applications, such as banking authentication, when minimizing false authentications is paramount."

The Face Mesh by MediaPipe is a lightweight framework that can identify facial landmarks with high accuracy and efficiency, which is considered to be important in real time use. The system detects the moments of long eye shutdowns or a very low rate of blinking which are manifestations of drowsiness and alerts the driver through sound to get her attention back. This system achieves a high-performance and low-cost driver monitoring solution with the help of the computational power of OpenCV to process the image and the MediaPipe to identify faces. Test data experimental analyses indicate that the system is very accurate and responds quicker; this confirms that it can be a component of the current Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS)."

We show that communication improves performance, but optimal communication design depends on market characteristics. Competitive conversation excels in volatile technology stocks, while collaborative conversation dominates stable general stocks. Finance stocks resist all communication interventions. Surprisingly, all structures, including isolated agents, converge to similar strategy alignments, challenging assumptions that transparency causes harmful diversity loss. Performance differences stem from behavioral mechanisms: competitive agents focus on stock-level allocation while collaborative agents develop technical frameworks. Conversation quality scores show zero correlation with returns. These findings demonstrate that optimal communication design must match market volatility characteristics, and sophisticated discussions don't guarantee better performance."

In this framework, clients employ lightweight models to process private data locally and transmit intermediate outputs to a powerful server for further computation. However, SFL is a double-edged sword: while it enables edge computing and enhances privacy, it also introduces intellectual property ambiguity as both clients and the server jointly contribute to training. Existing watermarking techniques fail to protect both sides since no single participant possesses the complete model. To address this, we propose RISE, a Robust model Intellectual property protection scheme using client-Server watermark Embedding for SFL. Specifically, RISE adopts an asymmetric client-server watermarking design: the server embeds feature-based watermarks through a loss regularization term, while clients embed backdoor-based watermarks by injecting predefined trigger samples into private datasets. This co-embedding strategy enables both clients and the server to verify model ownership. Experimental results on standard datasets and multiple network architectures show that RISE achieves over $95\\%$ watermark detection rate ($p-value \\lt 0.03$) across most settings. It exhibits no mutual interference between client- and server-side watermarks and remains robust against common removal attacks."

The results are minimal form factors which are the product of the undeformed solution and a new function. This function can be fixed by requiring constant asymptotics for large rapidities, smoothness in the limit when the perturbation parameters go to zero, and agreement with standard MFF formulae for particular choices of the perturbation couplings. We observe that, for a certain range of parameters, the new MFF develops a pole at $θ=0$. By considering several UV-complete theories, we argue that such poles can emerge naturally from the MFF integral representation and suggest how they may be eliminated."

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in LLM-powered agents have demonstrated significant potential in generating human-like responses; however, they continue to face challenges in maintaining long-term interactions within complex environments, primarily due to limitations in contextual consistency and dynamic personalization. Existing memory systems often depend on semantic grouping prior to retrieval, which can overlook semantically irrelevant yet critical user information and introduce retrieval noise. In this report, we propose the initial design of O-Mem, a novel memory framework based on active user profiling that dynamically extracts and updates user characteristics and event records from their proactive interactions with agents. O-Mem supports hierarchical retrieval of persona attributes and topic-related context, enabling more adaptive and coherent personalized responses. O-Mem achieves 51.76% on the public LoCoMo benchmark, a nearly 3% improvement upon LangMem,the previous state-of-the-art, and it achieves 62.99% on PERSONAMEM, a 3.5% improvement upon A-Mem,the previous state-of-the-art. O-Mem also boosts token and interaction response time efficiency compared to previous memory frameworks. Our work opens up promising directions for developing efficient and human-like personalized AI assistants in the future."

A rigorous convergence analysis is performed, and we demonstrate global linear convergence under certain sufficient conditions. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that HBNET-GIANT with heavy-ball momentum achieves acceleration, and the corresponding rate of convergence is strictly faster than its non-accelerated version, NETWORK-GIANT. Moreover, we compare HBNET-GIANT with several state-of-the-art algorithms, both momentum-based and without momentum, and report significant performance improvement in convergence to the optimum. We believe that this work lays the groundwork for a broader class of second-order Newton-type algorithms with momentum and motivates further investigation into open problems, including an analytical proof of local acceleration in the fully distributed setting for convex optimization problems."

    "abstract": "Person re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve target pedestrian images given either visual queries (image-to-image, I2I) or textual descriptions (text-to-image, T2I). Although both tasks share a common retrieval objective, they pose distinct challenges: I2I emphasizes discriminative identity learning, while T2I requires accurate cross-modal semantic alignment. Existing methods often treat these tasks separately, which may lead to representation entanglement and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a unified framework named Hierarchical Prompt Learning (HPL), which leverages task-aware prompt modeling to jointly optimize both tasks. Specifically, we first introduce a Task-Routed Transformer, which incorporates dual classification tokens into a shared visual encoder to route features for I2I and T2I branches respectively. On top of this, we develop a hierarchical prompt generation scheme that integrates identity-level learnable tokens with instance-level pseudo-text tokens. These pseudo-tokens are derived from image or text features via modality-specific inversion networks, injecting fine-grained, instance-specific semantics into the prompts. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Modal Prompt Regularization strategy to enforce semantic alignment in the prompt token space, ensuring that pseudo-prompts preserve source-modality characteristics while enhancing cross-modal transferability. Extensive experiments on multiple ReID benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both I2I and T2I tasks."

The energy defect of a given calculation is associated with the electron pair origin of configurations not yet generated and this defect is mapped onto the exchange interaction for the corresponding pair of spatial molecular orbitals. The orbitals can be of opposite spin and thus the contribution includes the self-energy and differs from fermion exchange due to antisymmetry. A single parameter multiplying the exchange integral, is determined from the exact thermodynamic energy of a few reference molecules. The value of the parameter depends on the basis and level of configuration interaction but is the same for all molecules. Calculated energies are compared with experimental thermodynamic data for a set of forty mainly organic molecules representing a wide range of bonding environments. Results are reported for two types of multi- reference CI calculations: 1) a triple-zeta basis plus d-type functions for C, N, O and F and an s, p basis for H, and 2) a severely truncated virtual space in which higher spherical harmonic basis functions are removed. The error of the initial CI calculations is large, however, including the exchange-based contribution brings calculated CI energies into much closer agreement with exact values."

    "abstract": "Understanding rare events is critical across domains ranging from signal processing to reliability and structural safety, extreme-weather forecasting, and insurance. The analysis of rare events is a computationally challenging problem, particularly in high dimensions $d$. In this work, we develop the first asymptotic high-dimensional theory of rare events. First, we exploit asymptotic integral methods recently developed by the first author to provide an asymptotic expansion of rare event probabilities. The expansion employs the geometry of the rare event boundary and the local behavior of the log probability density. Generically, the expansion is valid if $d^2\\llλ$, where $λ$ characterizes the extremity of the event. We prove this condition is necessary by constructing an example in which the first-order remainder is bounded above and below by $d^2/λ$. We also provide a nonasymptotic remainder bound which specifies the precise dependence of the remainder on $d$, $λ$, the density, and the boundary, and which shows that in certain cases, the condition $d^2\\ll λ$ can be relaxed. As an application of the theory, we derive asymptotic approximations to rare probabilities under the standard Gaussian density in high dimensions. In the second part of our work, we provide an asymptotic approximation to densities conditional on rare events. This gives rise to simple procedure for approximately sampling conditionally on the rare event using independent Gaussian and exponential random variables."

Boron oxide (BO) is a recently synthesized 2D monolayer which has yet to be thoroughly explored for its potential applications. In this article, using first principles calculations, we report, for the first time, the visible-light photocatalytic activity of a BO monolayer for water splitting under mechanical strain and surface modification with single- and double-atom decorations (C, N, Si, Ge, P, As). The pristine BO monolayer exhibits an indirect band gap of 3.8 eV with band edges spanning the water redox potentials, but its optical absorption lies in the UV region (~ 4.5 eV). Strain engineering tunes the band gap and band alignment with a minimal shifting in the optical absorption (~0.5 eV). Single atom decoration produces a metallic state for elements like N, P, As, and an insulating state for single C, Si, Ge with a partial shifting in optical absorption. In contrast, double atom decoration produces substantial band gap reduction, improved band alignment, a pronounced red-shift in optical absorption into the visible range (1.6 to 3.2 eV) thus satisfying the criteria for water splitting. The stability of all the adsorbed configurations was confirmed by negative formation energy and ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations. These findings suggest BO monolayer functionalization can improve photocatalytic efficiency, providing hydrogen generation insights."

The key idea is to first simulate the integrated intensity and the counting process using Inverse Gaussian and Poisson distributions, from which the jump times can then be easily recovered. Unlike conventional exact algorithms based on sampling jump times first, which have random computational complexity and can be prohibitive in the presence of high activity or singular kernels, our scheme has deterministic complexity which enables efficient large-scale Monte Carlo simulations and facilitates vectorization. Our method applies to any nonnegative, locally integrable kernel, including singular and non-monotone ones. By reformulating the scheme as a stochastic Volterra equation with a measure-valued kernel, we establish weak convergence to the target Hawkes process in the Skorokhod $J_1$-topology. Numerical experiments confirm substantial computational gains while preserving high accuracy across a wide range of kernels, with remarkably improved performance for a variant of our scheme based on the resolvent of the kernel."

To address these limitations, we propose ForgeDAN, a novel evolutionary framework for generating semantically coherent and highly effective adversarial prompts against aligned LLMs. First, ForgeDAN introduces multi-strategy textual perturbations across \\textit{character, word, and sentence-level} operations to enhance attack diversity; then we employ interpretable semantic fitness evaluation based on a text similarity model to guide the evolutionary process toward semantically relevant and harmful outputs; finally, ForgeDAN integrates dual-dimensional jailbreak judgment, leveraging an LLM-based classifier to jointly assess model compliance and output harmfulness, thereby reducing false positives and improving detection effectiveness. Our evaluation demonstrates ForgeDAN achieves high jailbreaking success rates while maintaining naturalness and stealth, outperforming existing SOTA solutions."

    "abstract": "Generative models have shown remarkable performance in speech enhancement (SE), achieving superior perceptual quality over traditional discriminative approaches. However, existing generative SE approaches often overlook the risk of hallucination under severe noise, leading to incorrect spoken content or inconsistent speaker characteristics, which we term linguistic and acoustic hallucinations, respectively. We argue that linguistic hallucination stems from models' failure to constrain valid phonological structures and it is a more fundamental challenge. While language models (LMs) are well-suited for capturing the underlying speech structure through modeling the distribution of discrete tokens, existing approaches are limited in learning from noise-corrupted representations, which can lead to contaminated priors and hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Phonologically Anchored Speech Enhancer (PASE), a generative SE framework that leverages the robust phonological prior embedded in the pre-trained WavLM model to mitigate hallucinations. First, we adapt WavLM into a denoising expert via representation distillation to clean its final-layer features. Guided by the model's intrinsic phonological prior, this process enables robust denoising while minimizing linguistic hallucinations. To further reduce acoustic hallucinations, we train the vocoder with a dual-stream representation: the high-level phonetic representation provides clean linguistic content, while a low-level acoustic representation retains speaker identity and prosody. Experimental results demonstrate that PASE not only surpasses state-of-the-art discriminative models in perceptual quality, but also significantly outperforms prior generative models with substantially lower linguistic and acoustic hallucinations."

As an alternative to uniform heating in a clean system, here we establish a Floquet superheating regime, where fast heating nucleates at ''hot spots\" generated by rare fluctuations in the local energy with respect to an appropriate effective Hamiltonian. Striking macroscopic consequences include exceptionally long-lived prethermalization and non-ergodic bimodal distributions of macroscopic observables. Superheating is predicated on a heating rate depending strongly on the local fluctuation; in our example, this is supplied by a sharp state-selective spin-echo, where the energy absorption is strongly suppressed for low-energy states, while thermal fluctuations open up excessive heating channels. A simple phenomenological theory is developed to show the existence of a critical droplet size, which incorporates heating by the driving field as well as the heat current out of the droplet. Our results shine light on a new heating mechanism and suggest new routes towards stabilizing non-equilibrium phases of matter in driven systems."

Non-Gaussian deviations in active Brownian particles are captured through excess kurtosis, reflecting heavy-tailed, finite-support, or bimodal distributions that evolve systematically over time. Time-dependent probability distributions exhibit distinct data collapses within different temporal regimes, confirming the robustness of the scaling behavior. Overall, this framework connects multiparticle interactions to microscopic dynamics, revealing experimentally accessible signatures of inertia in active matter."

Having an $\\hbar$-perfect graph opens up several applications: we find efficient schemes for entanglement detection, a connection to the complexity of shadow tomography, tight uncertainty relations and a construction for computing good lower on bounds ground state energies. Conversely this also induces quantum algorithms for computing the independence number. Albeit those algorithms do not immediately promise an advantage in runtime, we show that an approximate Hamilton encoding of the independence number can be achieved with an amount of qubits that typically scales logarithmically in the number of vertices.

At the wall, the inherent inversion symmetry-breaking induces local polar distortions dependent on the wall geometry, which couple to the magnetic order through the octahedral distortions. Noncollinear calculations reveal enhanced out-of-plane magnetic moments on the Mn atoms and a local, finite magnetization confined to the wall. Strain fields across twin walls thus give rise to coexistence of polarization and magnetization as well as magnetoelectric response that is absent and symmetry-forbidden in bulk CaMnO$_3$.

Given a source and a target shape, the composition of the inverse flow (source to anchor) with the forward flow (anchor to target), we continuously map points between the two surfaces. By encoding the shapes with a pointwise task-tailored embedding, this construction provides an invertible and modality-agnostic representation of maps between shapes across point clouds, meshes, signed distance fields (SDFs), and volumetric data. The resulting representation consistently achieves high coverage and accuracy across diverse benchmarks and challenging settings in shape matching. Beyond shape matching, our framework shows promising results in other tasks, including UV mapping and registration of raw point cloud scans of human bodies."

Later, Avramov-Buchweitz extended the notion of complexity from a single module to that of pairs of modules, which measures the polynomial growth rate of the minimal number of generators of their Ext modules. Dao studied a similar notion of Tor-complexity. Recently, Dey-Ghosh-Saha initiated the study of Ext and Tor curvature of a pair of modules, which measure the exponential growth rates of the corresponding Ext and Tor, respectively. On the other hand, the concept of Burch ideals was introduced by Dao-Kobayashi-Takahashi, motivated by classical work of Burch. This class includes several large and well-studied families of ideals in a Noetherian local ring $(R,\\mathfrak{m},k)$. For example, every nonzero ideal of the form $\\mathfrak{a}\\mathfrak{m}$ (e.g., $\\mathfrak{m}^n$ for $n\\ge 1$), and under mild conditions every integrally closed ideal $I$ with $\\mathrm{depth}(R/I)=0$, is a Burch ideal. Suppose $I$ and $J$ are Burch ideals such that $I$ is $\\mathfrak{m}$-primary. One of the main results of this article is $\\mathrm{cx}_R(I,J)=\\mathrm{tcx}_R(I,J)=\\mathrm{cx}_R(k)$.

Microscopic insights into these systems are often inferred from our understanding of the air-water interface, which is assumed to exhibit similar behavior. Here, we challenge this paradigm by combining heterodyne-detected vibrational sum-frequency generation spectroscopy with machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations at first-principles accuracy to investigate the graphene-NaCl(aq) interface as a prototypical hydrophobic solid-water system. Spectroscopic results suggest that ions have a minimal effect on the structure of the interfacial water, while simulations reveal that Na$^{+}$ and Cl$^{-}$ accumulate densely at the surface. Together, these findings reveal a new adsorption mechanism that departs from the established air-water interface paradigm, where interfacial ion adsorption is typically associated with, and often detected through, pronounced alteration of the interfacial water alignment and orientation. This difference arises because ions cannot penetrate the solid boundary and reside at a similar depth as the interfacial water molecules. As a consequence, large ion populations can be accommodated within the extended two-dimensional hydrogen-bond network at the interface, causing only minor local distortions but significant changes to its longer-range connectivity. These results reveal a distinct mechanism of electrolyte organization at aqueous-carbon interfaces, relevant to energy applications, where performance is highly sensitive to the local organization of interfacial water."

To generalize this, we introduce the local rotational subspace, $\\mathcal{T}_i$, which contains all motions, including deformations, that are locally invisible to the controller at node $i$. These two geometric objects provide a complete decomposition of the uncontrollable subspace. Finally, we demonstrate the dynamic implications of this structure by proving that the system's ability to recover its shape is determined by an input's alignment with the local component of the standard rotational rigid-body mode, directly linking the geometry of hidden modes to disturbance rejection.

    "abstract": "The time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) in real space is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of many-electron quantum systems, with applications ranging from quantum chemistry to condensed matter physics and materials science. However, solving the TDSE for complex fermionic systems remains a significant challenge, particularly due to the need to capture the time-evolving many-body correlations, while the antisymmetric nature of fermionic wavefunctions complicates the function space in which these solutions must be represented. We propose a general-purpose neural network framework for solving the real-space TDSE, Fermionic Antisymmetric Spatio-Temporal Network, which treats time as an explicit input alongside spatial coordinates, enabling a unified spatiotemporal representation of complex, antisymmetric wavefunctions for fermionic systems. This approach formulates the TDSE as a global optimization problem, avoiding step-by-step propagation and supporting highly parallelizable training. The method is demonstrated on four benchmark problems: a 1D harmonic oscillator, interacting fermions in a time-dependent harmonic trap, 3D hydrogen orbital dynamics, and a laser-driven H$_2$ molecule, achieving excellent agreement with reference solutions across all cases. These results confirm our method's scalability, accuracy, and flexibility across various dimensions and interaction regimes, while demonstrating its ability to accurately simulate long-time dynamics in complex systems. Our framework offers a highly expressive alternative to traditional basis-dependent or mean-field methods, opening new possibilities for ab initio simulations of time-dependent quantum systems, with applications in quantum dynamics, molecular control, and ultrafast spectroscopy."

    "abstract": "In this work we investigate the potential of a thermal infrared (IR) space telescope to remotely characterize the component temperatures of a satellite. With the rapid increase in the number of objects launched in recent years, the ability to detect, track, identify and determine the intent of satellites has become of increasing importance. Spectral modeling of satellites from multi-wavelength photometry in the thermal IR is a technique that has the potential to derive information about the temperature and operational status of a satellite in orbit, without the requirement to spatially resolve the target. Previous work has focused on determination of a single/effective temperature for a Resident Space Objects (RSOs) - such as satellites, asteroids, debris and rocket bodies - from remote observations, obtaining mixed results in terms of ability to classify objects. To progress, we explore a two-greybody component spectral model. Using this analytical model, we investigate which temperature characteristics may be identified from unresolved multi-wavelength photometric observations as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio, under the assumption of Poisson noise-dominated data. With this instrument-agnostic framework, we then quantify the potential of this model to discriminate between RSOs with a single temperature (e.g. natural rocks) versus human-made satellites with a chassis and deployed solar panels where significant component temperature differences exist under typical orbital configurations. Last, we comment on promising prospects of this model for applications to existing and future space telescope observations to characterize RSOs from spatially unresolved photometry"

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of reconstructing the intrinsic geometry of a manifold from noisy pairwise distance observations. Specifically, let $M$ denote a diameter 1 d-dimensional manifold and $μ$ a probability measure on $M$ that is mutually absolutely continuous with the volume measure. Suppose $X_1,\\dots,X_N$ are i.i.d. samples of $μ$ and we observe noisy-distance random variables $d'(X_j, X_k)$ that are related to the true geodesic distances $d(X_j,X_k)$. With mild assumptions on the distributions and independence of the noisy distances, we develop a new framework for recovering all distances between points in a sufficiently dense subsample of $M$. Our framework improves on previous work which assumed i.i.d. additive noise with known moments. Our method is based on a new way to estimate $L_2$-norms of certain expectation-functions $f_x(y)=\\mathbb{E}d'(x,y)$ and use them to build robust clusters centered at points of our sample. Using a new geometric argument, we establish that, under mild geometric assumptions--bounded curvature and positive injectivity radius--these clusters allow one to recover the true distances between points in the sample up to an additive error of $O(\\varepsilon \\log \\varepsilon^{-1})$. We develop two distinct algorithms for producing these clusters. The first achieves a sample complexity $N \\asymp \\varepsilon^{-2d-2}\\log(1/\\varepsilon)$ and runtime $o(N^3)$. The second introduces novel geometric ideas that warrant further investigation. In the presence of missing observations, we show that a quantitative lower bound on sampling probabilities suffices to modify the cluster construction in the first algorithm and extend all recovery guarantees. Our main technical result also elucidates which properties of a manifold are necessary for the distance recovery, which suggests further extension of our techniques to a broader class of metric probability spaces."

However, in fields that rely on professional knowledge, such as medicine and law, such large-scale preference labels are often unachievable. In this paper, we propose a generative entropy-guided preference modeling approach named GEM for LLMs aligment at low-resource and domain-specific scenarios. Instead of training a discriminative reward model on preference data, we directly train the LLM to internalize a closed-loop optimization architecture that can extract and exploit the multi-dimensional, fine-grained cognitive signals implicit in human preferences. Specifically, our Cognitive Filtering module, based on entropy theory in decision making, first leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to generate diverse candidate reasoning chains (CoTs) from preference data. Subsequently, it introduces a token scoring mechanism to rank and weight the sampled CoTs, boosting the importance of high-confidence answers and strategically high-entropy tokens. Building on these filtered preferences, we fine-tune the LLM using a novel self-evaluated group advantage algorithm, SEGA, which effectively aggregates group-level cognitive signals and transforms the entropy-based scores into implicit rewards for policy optimization. In these ways, GEM empowers the LLM to rely on its own judgments and establishes an entropy-guided closed-loop cognitive optimization framework, enabling highly efficient few-shot alignment of LLMs. Experiments on general benchmarks and domain-specific tasks (such as mathematical reasoning and medical dialogues) demonstrate that our GEM achieves significant improvements with few-shot preference data."

    "abstract": "Large vision-language models, such as CLIP, have shown strong zero-shot classification performance by aligning images and text in a shared embedding space. However, CLIP models often develop multimodal spurious biases, which is the undesirable tendency to rely on spurious features. For example, CLIP may infer object types in images based on frequently co-occurring backgrounds rather than the object's core features. This bias significantly impairs the robustness of pre-trained CLIP models on out-of-distribution data, where such cross-modal associations no longer hold. Existing methods for mitigating multimodal spurious bias typically require fine-tuning on downstream data or prior knowledge of the bias, which undermines the out-of-the-box usability of CLIP. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze the impact of multimodal spurious bias in zero-shot classification. Based on this insight, we propose Spuriousness-Aware Guided Exploration (SAGE), a simple and effective method that mitigates spurious bias through guided prompt selection. SAGE requires no training, fine-tuning, or external annotations. It explores a space of prompt templates and selects the prompts that induce the largest semantic separation between classes, thereby improving worst-group robustness. Extensive experiments on four real-world benchmark datasets and five popular backbone models demonstrate that SAGE consistently improves zero-shot performance and generalization, outperforming previous zero-shot approaches without any external knowledge or model updates."

Built upon a scale-wise autoregressive model, our method addresses two key challenges in consistent T2I generation: identity inconsistency and style inconsistency. To overcome these issues, we introduce three complementary techniques: Identity Prompt Replacement, which mitigates context bias in text encoders to align identity attributes across prompts; and a unified attention guidance mechanism comprising Adaptive Style Injection and Synchronized Guidance Adaptation, which jointly enforce global style and identity appearance consistency while preserving prompt fidelity. Unlike prior diffusion-based approaches that require fine-tuning or suffer from slow inference, Infinite-Story operates entirely at test time, delivering high identity and style consistency across diverse prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art generation performance, while offering over 6X faster inference (1.72 seconds per image) than the existing fastest consistent T2I models, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world visual storytelling."

However, audit artifacts are heterogeneous and often lack reproducible, executable PoC tests suitable for automated validation, leading to costly, ad hoc manual verification. Large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to turn audit reports into PoC test cases, but have three major challenges: noisy inputs, hallucinations, and missing runtime oracles. In this paper, we present SmartPoC, an automated framework that converts textual audit reports into executable, validated test cases. First, the input audit report is processed to reduce noise, and only bug-related functions are extracted and fed to LLMs as context. To curb hallucinations and ensure compile-and-run readiness, we leverage LLMs to synthesize PoC test cases with specially-designed pre-/post-execution repair. We further utilize differential verification as oracles to confirm exploitability of the PoC test cases. On the SmartBugs-Vul and FORGE-Vul benchmarks, SmartPoC generates executable, validated Foundry test cases for 85.61% and 86.45% of targets, respectively. Applied to the latest Etherscan verified-source corpus, SmartPoC confirms 236 real bugs out of 545 audit findings at a cost of only $0.03 per finding."

However, this crucial trait is severely undermined by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), a common technique for model specialization. Existing recovery methods rely on data-intensive global parameter adjustments, implicitly assuming that SFT deeply corrupts the models' ability to recognize their knowledge boundaries. However, we observe that fine-tuned LLMs still preserve this ability; what is damaged is their capacity to faithfully express that awareness. Building on this, we propose Honesty-Critical Neurons Restoration (HCNR) to surgically repair this suppressed capacity. HCNR identifies and restores key expression-governing neurons to their pre-trained state while harmonizing them with task-oriented neurons via Hessian-guided compensation. Experiments on four QA tasks and five LLM families demonstrate that HCNR effectively recovers 33.25% of the compromised honesty while achieving at least 2.23x speedup with over 10x less data compared to baseline methods, offering a practical solution for trustworthy LLM deployment."

The test statistic measures variance reduction when comparing within group to between group dispersions in the Wasserstein space. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method suppresses small random perturbations while maintaining sensitivity to genuine topological differences, particularly when applied to Hodge decomposed flows rather than raw edge weights.

X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on multiple ZBLAN samples representing distinct structural states: fully amorphous, incipiently crystalline, and highly crystalline, produced through thermal treatments at 250C and 350C and vibration-assisted processing at 400C under low (L2) and high (H5) vibration levels. High-resolution F 1s, Zr 3d, Hf 4f, Ba 3d, La 3d, and Na 1s spectra show progressive peak sharpening and intensity enhancement with increasing temperature and vibration, indicating reduced surface disorder and greater local structural ordering. The most pronounced changes occur under high vibration at 400C. No binding-energy shifts were detected, confirming that all elements retain their expected oxidation states and that the observed evolution reflects structural rather than chemical changes. These results provide direct evidence that thermomechanical input enhances surface ordering in ZBLAN and clarify its role in crystallization behavior relevant to infrared optical applications."

    "abstract": "The growing scale of datasets in deep learning has introduced significant computational challenges. Dataset pruning addresses this challenge by constructing a compact but informative coreset from the full dataset with comparable performance. Previous approaches typically establish scoring metrics based on specific criteria to identify representative samples. However, these methods predominantly rely on sample scores obtained from the model's performance during the training (i.e., fitting) phase. As scoring models achieve near-optimal performance on training data, such fitting-centric approaches induce a dense distribution of sample scores within a narrow numerical range. This concentration reduces the distinction between samples and hinders effective selection. To address this challenge, we conduct dataset pruning from the perspective of generalization, i.e., scoring samples based on models not exposed to them during training. We propose a plug-and-play framework, UNSEEN, which can be integrated into existing dataset pruning methods. Additionally, conventional score-based methods are single-step and rely on models trained solely on the complete dataset, providing limited perspective on the importance of samples. To address this limitation, we scale UNSEEN to multi-step scenarios and propose an incremental selection technique through scoring models trained on varying coresets, and optimize the quality of the coreset dynamically. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K. Notably, on ImageNet-1K, UNSEEN achieves lossless performance while reducing training data by 30\\%."

This paper introduces MCAQ-YOLO, a morphological complexity-aware quantization framework for object detection. The framework employs five morphological metrics - fractal dimension, texture entropy, gradient variance, edge density, and contour complexity - to characterize local visual morphology and guide spatially adaptive bit allocation. By correlating these metrics with quantization sensitivity, MCAQ-YOLO dynamically adjusts bit precision according to spatial complexity. In addition, a curriculum-based quantization-aware training scheme progressively increases quantization difficulty to stabilize optimization and accelerate convergence. Experimental results demonstrate a strong correlation between morphological complexity and quantization sensitivity and show that MCAQ-YOLO achieves superior detection accuracy and convergence efficiency compared with uniform quantization. On a safety equipment dataset, MCAQ-YOLO attains 85.6 percent mAP@0.5 with an average of 4.2 bits and a 7.6x compression ratio, yielding 3.5 percentage points higher mAP than uniform 4-bit quantization while introducing only 1.8 ms of additional runtime overhead per image. Cross-dataset validation on COCO and Pascal VOC further confirms consistent performance gains, indicating that morphology-driven spatial quantization can enhance efficiency and robustness for computationally constrained, safety-critical visual recognition tasks."

Many learning-based and model-based methods exist that estimate event-based optical flow, however the temporally dense yet spatially sparse nature of events poses significant challenges. To address these issues, contrast maximization (CM) is a prominent model-based optimization methodology that estimates the motion trajectories of events within an event volume by optimally warping them. Since its introduction, the CM framework has undergone a series of refinements by the computer vision community. Nonetheless, it remains a highly non-convex optimization problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel biologically-inspired hybrid CM method for event-based optical flow estimation that couples visual and inertial motion cues. Concretely, we propose the use of orientation maps, derived from camera 3D velocities, as priors to guide the CM process. The orientation maps provide directional guidance and constrain the space of estimated motion trajectories. We show that this orientation-guided formulation leads to improved robustness and convergence in event-based optical flow estimation. The evaluation of our approach on the MVSEC, DSEC, and ECD datasets yields superior accuracy scores over the state of the art."

Impressive progress has been achieved by learning-based algorithms which require LDR-HDR image pairs. However, these pairs are hard to obtain, which motivates researchers to delve into the problem of annotation-efficient HDR image reconstructing: how to achieve comparable performance with limited HDR ground truths (GTs). This work attempts to address this problem from the view of semi-supervised learning where a teacher model generates pseudo HDR GTs for the LDR samples without GTs and a student model learns from pseudo GTs. Nevertheless, the confirmation bias, i.e., the student may learn from the artifacts in pseudo HDR GTs, presents an impediment. To remove this impediment, an uncertainty-based masking process is proposed to discard unreliable parts of pseudo GTs at both pixel and patch levels, then the trusted areas can be learned from by the student. With this novel masking process, our semi-supervised HDR reconstructing method not only outperforms previous annotation-efficient algorithms, but also achieves comparable performance with up-to-date fully-supervised methods by using only 6.7% HDR GTs."

We construct a partial decryption verifiable threshold multi client function encryption scheme, and apply it to Federated learning to implement the federated learning verifiable threshold security aggregation protocol (VTSAFL). VTSAFL empowers clients to verify aggregation results, concurrently minimizing both computational and communication overhead. The size of the functional key and partial decryption results of the scheme are constant, which provides efficiency guarantee for large-scale deployment. The experimental results on MNIST dataset show that vtsafl can achieve the same accuracy as the existing scheme, while reducing the total training time by more than 40%, and reducing the communication overhead by up to 50%. This efficiency is critical for overcoming the resource constraints inherent in Internet of Things (IoT) devices."

    "abstract": "We propose PFAvatar (Pose-Fusion Avatar), a new method that reconstructs high-quality 3D avatars from ``Outfit of the Day'' (OOTD) photos, which exhibit diverse poses, occlusions, and complex backgrounds. Our method consists of two stages: (1) fine-tuning a pose-aware diffusion model from few-shot OOTD examples and (2) distilling a 3D avatar represented by a neural radiance field (NeRF). In the first stage, unlike previous methods that segment images into assets (e.g., garments, accessories) for 3D assembly, which is prone to inconsistency, we avoid decomposition and directly model the full-body appearance. By integrating a pre-trained ControlNet for pose estimation and a novel Condition Prior Preservation Loss (CPPL), our method enables end-to-end learning of fine details while mitigating language drift in few-shot training. Our method completes personalization in just 5 minutes, achieving a 48$\\times$ speed-up compared to previous approaches. In the second stage, we introduce a NeRF-based avatar representation optimized by canonical SMPL-X space sampling and Multi-Resolution 3D-SDS. Compared to mesh-based representations that suffer from resolution-dependent discretization and erroneous occluded geometry, our continuous radiance field can preserve high-frequency textures (e.g., hair) and handle occlusions correctly through transmittance. Experiments demonstrate that PFAvatar outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction fidelity, detail preservation, and robustness to occlusions/truncations, advancing practical 3D avatar generation from real-world OOTD albums. In addition, the reconstructed 3D avatar supports downstream applications such as virtual try-on, animation, and human video reenactment, further demonstrating the versatility and practical value of our approach."

    "abstract": "In industrial recommendation systems, pre-ranking models based on deep neural networks (DNNs) commonly adopt a sequential execution framework: feature fetching and model forward computation are triggered only after receiving candidates from the upstream retrieval stage. This design introduces inherent bottlenecks, including redundant computations of identical users/items and increased latency due to strictly sequential operations, which jointly constrain the model's capacity and system efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the Asynchronous Inference Framework (AIF), a cost-effective computational architecture that decouples interaction-independent components, those operating within a single user or item, from real-time prediction. AIF reorganizes the model inference process by performing user-side computations in parallel with the retrieval stage and conducting item-side computations in a nearline manner. This means that interaction-independent components are calculated just once and completed before the real-time prediction phase of the pre-ranking stage. As a result, AIF enhances computational efficiency and reduces latency, freeing up resources to significantly improve the feature set and model architecture of interaction-independent components. Moreover, we delve into model design within the AIF framework, employing approximated methods for interaction-dependent components in online real-time predictions. By co-designing both the framework and the model, our solution achieves notable performance gains without significantly increasing computational and latency costs. This has enabled the successful deployment of AIF in the Taobao display advertising system."

Based on the benchmarked (TD)DFT protocol, a computational set studying six systematic analogues allowed us to study the influence of electron-donating (-OMe) and electron-withdrawing (-CF3) substituents on the common backbone, revealing the impact of substitution on the geometry and photophysics of light-atom analogues of HM610 and paving the way for future studies where the introduction of heavy atoms and their impact on triplet sensitization by this family of chromophores can be probed."

    "abstract": "Object 6D pose estimation, a crucial task for robotics and augmented reality applications, becomes particularly challenging when dealing with novel objects whose 3D models are not readily available. To reduce dependency on 3D models, recent studies have explored one-reference-based pose estimation, which requires only a single reference view instead of a complete 3D model. However, existing methods that rely on real-valued coordinate regression suffer from limited global consistency due to the local nature of convolutional architectures and face challenges in symmetric or occluded scenarios owing to a lack of uncertainty modeling. We present CoordAR, a novel autoregressive framework for one-reference 6D pose estimation of unseen objects. CoordAR formulates 3D-3D correspondences between the reference and query views as a map of discrete tokens, which is obtained in an autoregressive and probabilistic manner. To enable accurate correspondence regression, CoordAR introduces 1) a novel coordinate map tokenization that enables probabilistic prediction over discretized 3D space; 2) a modality-decoupled encoding strategy that separately encodes RGB appearance and coordinate cues; and 3) an autoregressive transformer decoder conditioned on both position-aligned query features and the partially generated token sequence. With these novel mechanisms, CoordAR significantly outperforms existing methods on multiple benchmarks and demonstrates strong robustness to symmetry, occlusion, and other challenges in real-world tests."

This paper proposes the Chain-of-Scheduling (CoS) framework, which activates the event scheduling capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a guided, efficient scheduling process. CoS enhances LLM by formulating the schedule task into three atomic stages, i.e., exploration, verification and integration. Then we enable the LLMs to generate CoS autonomously via Knowledge Distillation (KD). Experimental results show that CoS achieves near-theoretical optimal effectiveness with high efficiency on three real-world datasets in a interpretable manner. Moreover, it demonstrates strong zero-shot learning ability on out-of-domain data."

    "abstract": "As renewable energy sources become more prevalent, accurately modeling power grid dynamics is becoming increasingly more complex. Concurrently, data acquisition and realtime system state monitoring are becoming more available for control centers. This motivates shifting from \\textit{model- and Lyapunov-based} feedback controller designs toward \\textit{model-free} ones. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a key tool for designing model-free controllers. Various studies have been carried out to study voltage/frequency control strategies via RL. However, usually a simplified system model is used neglecting detailed dynamics of solar, wind, and composite loads -- and damping system-wide oscillations and modeling power flows are all usually ignored. To that end, we pose an optimal feedback control problem for a detailed renewables-heavy power system, defined by a set of nonlinear differential algebraic equations (NDAE). The control problem is solved using a completely model-free design via RL as well as using a model-based approach built upon the Lyapunov stability theory with guarantees. The paper in its essence seeks to explore whether data-driven feedback control should be used in power grids over its model-driven counterpart. Theoretical developments and thorough case studies are presented with an eye on this exploration. Finally, a detailed analysis is provided to delineate the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches for renewables-heavy grids."

    "abstract": "Sports video understanding presents unique challenges, requiring models to perceive high-speed dynamics, comprehend complex rules, and reason over long temporal contexts. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in genral domains, the current state of research in sports remains narrowly focused: existing approaches are either single-sport centric, limited to specific tasks, or rely on training-free paradigms that lack robust, learned reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce DeepSport, the first end-to-end trained MLLM framework designed for multi-task, multi-sport video understanding. DeepSport shifts the paradigm from passive frame processing to active, iterative reasoning, empowering the model to ``think with videos'' by dynamically interrogating content via a specialized frame-extraction tool. To enable this, we propose a data distillation pipeline that synthesizes high-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectories from 10 diverse data source, creating a unified resource of 78k training data. We then employ a two-stage training strategy, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel gated tool-use reward, to optimize the model's reasoning process. Extensive experiments on the testing benchmark of 6.7k questions demonstrate that DeepSport achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baselines of both proprietary model and open-source models. Our work establishes a new foundation for domain-specific video reasoning to address the complexities of diverse sports."

It has been implemented and validated across multiple frequency regimes, including ion cyclotron (ICRF), lower hybrid (LHRF), and electron cyclotron (ECRF) ranges of frequencies, with results benchmarked against conventional $Z(ζ)$ and Bessel function expansions. Integrated into the BORAY ray-tracing code, the method uses expressions derived from the anti-Hermitian part of the dielectric tensor to compute absorption ratios.

In particular, black hole solutions such as the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics feature central singularities that signal the incompleteness of the theory in high curvature regimes. This thesis is devoted to the study of modified theories of gravity that aim to resolve these singularities and construct physically viable models of regular black holes: black holes that retain an event horizon but exhibit no curvature divergence anywhere in the spacetime ... Throughout the thesis, particular care is taken to ensure that the proposed models are physically sensible: they reduce to GR in the appropriate limits and lead to well behaved curvature scalars. Collectively, these results highlight the viability of regular black hole models in modified gravity theories, providing a promising path toward a consistent semiclassical description of black holes that avoids the need for quantum gravitational resolution of singularities.

    "abstract": "Due to the diversity of brain anatomy and the scarcity of annotated data, supervised anomaly detection for brain MRI remains challenging, driving the development of unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) approaches. Current UAD methods typically utilize artificially generated noise perturbations on healthy MRIs to train generative models for normal anatomy reconstruction, enabling anomaly detection via residual mapping. However, such simulated anomalies lack the biophysical fidelity and morphological complexity characteristic of true clinical lesions. To advance UAD in brain MRI, we conduct the first systematic frequency-domain analysis of pathological signatures, revealing two key properties: (1) anomalies exhibit unique frequency patterns distinguishable from normal anatomy, and (2) low-frequency signals maintain consistent representations across healthy scans. These insights motivate our Frequency-Decomposition Preprocessing (FDP) framework, the first UAD method to leverage frequency-domain reconstruction for simultaneous pathology suppression and anatomical preservation. FDP can integrate seamlessly with existing anomaly simulation techniques, consistently enhancing detection performance across diverse architectures while maintaining diagnostic fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that FDP consistently improves anomaly detection performance when integrated with existing methods. Notably, FDP achieves a 17.63% increase in DICE score with LDM while maintaining robust improvements across multiple baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/ls1rius/MRI_FDP."

To address this, we propose ActVAR, a dynamic activation framework that introduces dual sparsity across model weights and token sequences to enhance efficiency without sacrificing capacity. ActVAR decomposes feedforward networks (FFNs) into lightweight expert sub-networks and employs a learnable router to dynamically select token-specific expert subsets based on content. Simultaneously, a gated token selector identifies high-update-potential tokens for computation while reconstructing unselected tokens to preserve global context and sequence alignment. Training employs a two-stage knowledge distillation strategy, where the original VAR model supervises the learning of routing and gating policies to align with pretrained knowledge. Experiments on the ImageNet $256\\times 256$ benchmark demonstrate that ActVAR achieves up to $21.2\\%$ FLOPs reduction with minimal performance degradation."

However, current assessment practices still rely heavily on expert-based subjective scoring, which is both labor-intensive and inherently subjective. In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework for automatic and interpretable creativity assessment from drawings. Motivated by the cognitive understanding that creativity can emerge from both what is drawn (content) and how it is drawn (style), we reinterpret the creativity score as a function of these two complementary dimensions.Specifically, we first augment an existing creativity labeled dataset with additional annotations targeting content categories. Based on the enriched dataset, we further propose a multi-modal, multi-task learning framework that simultaneously predicts creativity scores, categorizes content types, and extracts stylistic features. In particular, we introduce a conditional learning mechanism that enables the model to adapt its visual feature extraction by dynamically tuning it to creativity-relevant signals conditioned on the drawing's stylistic and semantic cues.Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing regression-based approaches and offers interpretable visualizations that align well with human judgments.

LAMP follows a Think-Speak-Decide pipeline: (1) Think interprets numerical observations to extract short-term shocks and long-term trends, caching high-value reasoning trajectories; (2) Speak crafts and exchanges strategic messages based on reasoning, updating beliefs by parsing peer communications; and (3) Decide fuses numerical data, reasoning, and reflections into a MARL policy to optimize language-augmented decision-making.

While existing approaches in multi-view setups with fully overlapping sensors benefit from consistent view coverage, partially overlapping settings where actions are visible in only a subset of views remain underexplored. This challenge becomes more severe in real-world scenarios, as many systems provide only limited input modalities and rely on sequence-level annotations instead of dense frame-level labels. In this study, we propose View-aware Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ViCoKD), a framework that distills knowledge from a fully supervised multi-modal teacher to a modality- and annotation-limited student. ViCoKD employs a cross-modal adapter with cross-modal attention, allowing the student to exploit multi-modal correlations while operating with incomplete modalities. Moreover, we propose a View-aware Consistency module to address view misalignment, where the same action may appear differently or only partially across viewpoints. It enforces prediction alignment when the action is co-visible across views, guided by human-detection masks and confidence-weighted Jensen-Shannon divergence between their predicted class distributions. Experiments on the real-world MultiSensor-Home dataset show that ViCoKD consistently outperforms competitive distillation methods across multiple backbones and environments, delivering significant gains and surpassing the teacher model under limited conditions."

The algorithm provides theoretical guarantees on performance, including expected false alarm rate and worst-case average detection delay. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RoS-Guard and demonstrate significant computational speedup in large-scale system scenarios."

    "abstract": "This study introduces a novel iron-based gas diffusion electrode-photocatalytic system aimed at enhancing the degradation of phenolic compounds in wastewater. Phenolic compounds are toxic environmental pollutants with significant resistance to biodegradation. The traditional methods for treating phenol wastewater, including biological treatments and adsorption techniques, often fall short in achieving complete mineralization. Our approach utilizes a dual-chamber electrochemical setup integrating stainless steel felt-2-EAQ gas diffusion electrodes with TiO2 photocatalysis. This combination significantly boosts hydroxyl radical production, critical for effective pollutant breakdown. Experimentally, the system achieved up to 92% degradation efficiency for phenol at an optimized operating current of 10 mA/cm^2 in 3 hours, surpassing traditional methods. Additionally, energy consumption was reduced by 40% compared to conventional electro-Fenton systems. The stability tests indicated that the electrodes maintain over 80% of their initial activity after five cycles of use. These findings suggest that our system offers a more sustainable and efficient solution for treating phenolic wastewater by enhancing both degradation rates and energy efficiency."

    "abstract": "In this study, piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) are designed to offer dual functionality in structural health monitoring (SHM): harvesting electric power from bridge vibrations while serving as intrinsic damage sensors. This strategy utilises the voltage signal directly as the sensing input, eliminating the need for traditional sensing modules and thereby reducing system complexity and energy consumption. A bi-objective optimisation framework is proposed to maximise both power output and damage detection accuracy of a PEH modelled as a composite cantilevered Kirchhoff-Love plate. Voltage responses under realistic bridge inputs are predicted via isogeometric analysis. The approach is validated in two scenarios: a numerical vehicle-bridge interaction model and a laboratory-scale beam test using a toy car, each evaluated in both healthy and damaged states. Unsupervised damage detection is achieved using a convolutional variational autoencoder (CVAE) trained solely on healthy voltage signatures. The NSGA-II algorithm is applied to explore trade-offs between energy yield and sensing precision, including parametric studies on damage severity, damage location, and harvester geometry. Results indicate that optimised PEHs not only act as an effective filter and sensing component but also outperform traditional acceleration-based sensing, improving damage detection accuracy by 13% while reducing energy consumption by 98%. The multi-parameter design space further highlights the importance of bi-objective optimisation due to variations in performance even under resonant conditions. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of replacing traditional sensors with lightweight, self-powered PEHs and pave the way for sustainable simultaneous energy harvesting and sensing (SEHS) systems."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method for transient stability analysis (TSA) that circumvents the limitations of sequential numerical integration and energy functions. The proposed method begins by constructing a trajectory-dependent stability indicator function to distinguish the system's destiny. To overcome the difficulty in analyzing the asymptotic behavior at infinite time, a strategic time contraction mapping is then applied. This allows TSA to be recast as a pole-placement detection problem for the indicator function. By leveraging high-order derivatives at the initial state, a rational function approximation is derived, yielding a mathematically direct and computationally efficient prediction. Numerical validations on benchmark systems demonstrate that the method not only provides a direct mathematical shortcut for TSA in power systems but also establishes a promising new methodology for evaluating the transient stability of a broad class of nonlinear dynamical systems."

Current training methods train a unified large language model (LLM) for all agents in the system. This may limit the performances due to different distributions underlying for different agents. Therefore, training multi-agent systems with distinct LLMs should be the next step to solve. However, this approach introduces optimization challenges. For example, agents operate at different frequencies, rollouts involve varying sub-agent invocations, and agents are often deployed across separate servers, disrupting end-to-end gradient flow. To address these issues, we propose M-GRPO, a hierarchical extension of Group Relative Policy Optimization designed for vertical Multi-agent systems with a main agent (planner) and multiple sub-agents (multi-turn tool executors). M-GRPO computes group-relative advantages for both main and sub-agents, maintaining hierarchical credit assignment. It also introduces a trajectory-alignment scheme that generates fixed-size batches despite variable sub-agent invocations. We deploy a decoupled training pipeline in which agents run on separate servers and exchange minimal statistics via a shared store. This enables scalable training without cross-server backpropagation. In experiments on real-world benchmarks (e.g., GAIA, XBench-DeepSearch, and WebWalkerQA), M-GRPO consistently outperforms both single-agent GRPO and multi-agent GRPO with frozen sub-agents, demonstrating improved stability and sample efficiency. These results show that aligning heterogeneous trajectories and decoupling optimization across specialized agents enhances tool-augmented reasoning tasks."

In this work, we demonstrate a novel programmable photonic Ising solver based on a hexagonal mesh general-purpose programmable photonic platform. The integrated system allows reconfigurable matrix multiplication and computes the Hamiltonian iteratively using an annealing algorithm that facilitates spin updates and effectively searches for the ground state. As a proof of concept, we experimentally solve two benchmark optimization problems, a fundamental three-node ferromagnetic coupling problem with external bias that demonstrates nontrivial spin interactions, and a four-node Max-Cut problem with arbitrary coupling matrices. Furthermore, to establish a large-scale capability, we emulated Ising problems with sizes up to N = 50, achieving success probabilities exceeding 80\\%. Additionally, we examined the impact of errors, such as phase and coupling, on the performance of the programmable photonic Ising machine.

This work presents SF-Recon, a method that directly reconstructs lightweight building surfaces from multi-view images without post-hoc mesh simplification. We first train an initial 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) field to obtain a view-consistent representation. Building structure is then distilled by a normal-gradient-guided Gaussian optimization that selects primitives aligned with roof and wall boundaries, followed by multi-view edge-consistency pruning to enhance structural sharpness and suppress non-structural artifacts without external supervision. Finally, a multi-view depth-constrained Delaunay triangulation converts the structured Gaussian field into a lightweight, structurally faithful building mesh. Based on a proposed SF dataset, the experimental results demonstrate that our SF-Recon can directly reconstruct lightweight building models from multi-view imagery, achieving substantially fewer faces and vertices while maintaining computational efficiency.

Existing research has primarily focused on GenAI's ability to complete educational tasks and its impact on student performance, often overlooking its effects on knowledge gains. In this study, we investigate how GenAI assistance compares to conventional online resources in supporting knowledge gains across different proficiency levels. We conducted a controlled user experiment with 24 undergraduate students of two different levels of programming experience (beginner, intermediate) to examine how students interact with ChatGPT while solving programming tasks. We analyzed task performance, conceptual understanding, and interaction behaviors. Our findings reveal that generating complete solutions with GenAI significantly improves task performance, especially for beginners, but does not consistently result in knowledge gains. Importantly, usage strategies differ by experience: beginners tend to rely heavily on GenAI toward task completion often without knowledge gain in the process, while intermediates adopt more selective approaches. We find that both over-reliance and minimal use result in weaker knowledge gains overall. Based on our results, we call on students and educators to adopt GenAI as a learning rather than a problem solving tool. Our study highlights the urgent need for guidance when integrating GenAI into programming education to foster deeper understanding."

    "abstract": "Real-world tasks and environments exhibit differences from the static datasets that large language models (LLMs) are typically evaluated on. Such tasks can involve sequential interaction, requiring coherent updating of beliefs in light of new evidence, and making appropriate decisions based on those beliefs. Predicting how LLMs will perform in such dynamic environments is important, but can be tricky to determine from measurements in static settings. In this work, we examine two critical components of LLM performance: the ability of LLMs to coherently update their beliefs, and the extent to which the actions they take are consistent with those beliefs. First, we find that LLMs are largely inconsistent in how they update their beliefs; models can exhibit up to a 30% average difference between the directly elicited posterior, and the correct update of their prior. Second, we find that LLMs also often take actions which are inconsistent with the beliefs they hold. On a betting market, for example, LLMs often do not even bet in the same direction as their internally held beliefs over the underlying outcomes. We also find they have moderate self-inconsistency in how they respond to challenges by users to given answers. Finally, we show that the above properties hold even for strong models that obtain high accuracy or that are well-calibrated on the tasks at hand. Our results highlight the difficulties of predicting LLM behavior in complex real-world settings."

However, realizing such extreme confinement in a stable and controllable manner remains a key challenge. Here, we introduce a van der Waals material-based nano-cQED platform by coupling monolayer MoS2 excitons to plasmonic sub-nanocavities formed via assembly of ultrasmall gold clusters (3-5 nm) in the nanogap of a nanoparticle-on-mirror nanocavity. These clusters emulate the field-confining role of atomic protrusions of the picocavities through a resonance-insensitive lightning-rod effect, achieving deep-subwavelength mode volumes. In this nano-cQED testbed, we observe pronounced multi-branch Rabi splittings and ultrastrong lower-branch polaritonic photoluminescence with up to 10^4-fold enhancement. This deterministic architecture provides a controllable pathway to access picocavity-like behavior and opens new opportunities for single-molecule spectroscopy and the exploration of nano-cQED."

For example, a seemingly natural strategy is incremental, where the robot verbalizes its planned actions in plan order. However, an important aspect of this type of strategy is that it misses considerations on what is effectively informative to communicate, because not considering what the user knows prior to explanations. In this paper we propose a verbalization strategy to communicate robot plans informatively, by measuring the information gain that verbalizations have against a second-order theory of mind of the user capturing his prior knowledge on the robot. As shown in our experiments, this strategy allows to understand the robot's goal much quicker than by using strategies such as increasing or decreasing plan order. In addition, following our formulation we hint to what is informative and why when a robot communicates its plan."

    "abstract": "Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are most commonly optimised with first-order optimisers such as stochastic gradient descent. However, when optimising for parameters of probabilistic models, incorporating second order information during optimisation can lead to a more direct path in the distribution space and faster convergence. In this work we examine whether using natural gradient descent can improve the performance of variational inference based classification of radio galaxies. We use the Improved Variational Online Newton (iVON) algorithm and compare its performance against a recent benchmark for BNNs for radio galaxy classification. We find that iVON results in better uncertainty calibration out of all the methods previously considered while providing similar predictive performance to the best performing inference methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Bayes by Backprop based variational inference. Models trained with iVON can distinguish far out-of-distribution optical galaxy data, but they cannot reliably detect radio galaxy images from a telescope with different resolution and sensitivity. We find that the cold posterior effect persists in the models trained with iVON. Our results suggest that the choice of the optimiser can lead to qualitatively different solutions and future work using probabilistic neural network models should carefully consider the inductive biases being encoded through the optimisation process, in addition to the data, architecture and inference method."

    "abstract": "Emerging reasoning LLMs such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved strong performance on complex reasoning tasks by generating long chain-of-thought (CoT) traces. However, these long CoTs result in increased token usage, leading to higher inference latency and memory consumption. As a result, balancing accuracy and reasoning efficiency has become essential for deploying reasoning LLMs in practical applications. Existing long-to-short (Long2Short) methods aim to reduce inference length but often sacrifice accuracy, revealing a need for an approach that maintains performance while lowering token costs. To address this efficiency-accuracy tradeoff, we propose TokenSqueeze, a novel Long2Short method that condenses reasoning paths while preserving performance and relying exclusively on self-generated data. First, to prevent performance degradation caused by excessive compression of reasoning depth, we propose to select self-generated samples whose reasoning depth is adaptively matched to the complexity of the problem. To further optimize the linguistic expression without altering the underlying reasoning paths, we introduce a distribution-aligned linguistic refinement method that enhances the clarity and conciseness of the reasoning path while preserving its logical integrity. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenSqueeze in reducing token usage while maintaining accuracy. Notably, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B fine-tuned using our proposed method achieved a 50\\% average token reduction while preserving accuracy on the MATH500 benchmark. TokenSqueeze exclusively utilizes the model's self-generated data, enabling efficient and high-fidelity reasoning without relying on manually curated short-answer datasets across diverse applications.

We address the question of whether there exist energy functionals with a clear physical interpretation whose stationary points, the zeros of their first variation, correspond to solutions of the Helmholtz problem. Starting from Hamilton's principle for the wave equation, we derive time-harmonic energies. The resulting functionals are generally indefinite. As a next step, we construct strongly coercive augmentations of these indefinite functionals that preserve their physical interpretation. Finally, we show how these variational principles lead to practical numerical methods based on finite element spaces and neural network architectures."

    "abstract": "Deployment of legged robots for navigating challenging terrains (e.g., stairs, slopes, and unstructured environments) has gained increasing preference over wheel-based platforms. In such scenarios, accurate odometry estimation is a preliminary requirement for stable locomotion, localization, and mapping. Traditional proprioceptive approaches, which rely on leg kinematics sensor modalities and inertial sensing, suffer from irrepressible vertical drift caused by frequent contact impacts, foot slippage, and vibrations, particularly affected by inaccurate roll and pitch estimation. Existing methods incorporate exteroceptive sensors such as LiDAR or cameras. Further enhancement has been introduced by leveraging gravity vector estimation to add additional observations on roll and pitch, thereby increasing the accuracy of vertical pose estimation. However, these approaches tend to degrade in feature-sparse or repetitive scenes and are prone to errors from double-integrated IMU acceleration. To address these challenges, we propose GaRLILEO, a novel gravity-aligned continuous-time radar-leg-inertial odometry framework. GaRLILEO decouples velocity from the IMU by building a continuous-time ego-velocity spline from SoC radar Doppler and leg kinematics information, enabling seamless sensor fusion which mitigates odometry distortion. In addition, GaRLILEO can reliably capture accurate gravity vectors leveraging a novel soft S2-constrained gravity factor, improving vertical pose accuracy without relying on LiDAR or cameras. Evaluated on a self-collected real-world dataset with diverse indoor-outdoor trajectories, GaRLILEO demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly in vertical odometry estimation on stairs and slopes.

Our objective is to produce a baseline schedule that can be reused multiple times in an industrial setting regardless of the actual duration scenario. We leverage Graph Neural Networks in conjunction with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to develop an effective policy for task scheduling. This policy operates similarly to a priority dispatch rule and is paired with a Serial Schedule Generation Scheme to produce a schedule. Our empirical evaluation on standard benchmarks demonstrates the approach's superiority in terms of performance and its ability to generalize. The developed framework, Wheatley, is made publicly available online to facilitate further research and reproducibility."

    "abstract": "Solar hard X-ray observations provide diagnostics of the hottest plasmas and of nonthermal electron populations present during solar flares and coronal mass ejections. HXR images of specific energy ranges often contain overlapping contributions of these components, complicating their interpretation. This is even more challenging as HXR imagers generally use an indirect imaging system. Our work aims to separately image individual spectral components, such as thermal loops, superhot sources, and nonthermal footpoint sources, rather than obtaining images of specific energy ranges that show a combination of all components. We introduce a new method called spectral component imaging and apply it to observations provided by the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) aboard Solar Orbiter. First, the flare integrated HXR spectrum is fitted with individual spectral components to get the relative contributions of each component in each native STIX energy channel. In a second step, a set of linear equations is created based on these weights and the observed, energy-dependent STIX visibilities. The visibilities of the individual spectral components are derived by means of a linear least-squares approach and are subsequently utilized for image reconstructions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of spectral component imaging on four different flares observed by STIX. This method provides powerful diagnostics, particularly for flares with hot and superhot components, allowing us to spatially separate these two thermal components. We apply our methodology to the nonthermal peak of the X7.1 flare SOL2024-10-01, and we find that the superhot component is located 4.8 Mm away from the hot thermal loops. The thermal energy of the superhot component is approximately 20% of the energy content of the hot component, highlighting the significance of superhot components in the total flare energy budget."

    "abstract": "Modeling and congestion mitigation of mixed-autonomy traffic systems consisting of human-driven vehicles (HVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs) have become increasingly critical with the rapid development of autonomous driving technology. This paper develops an event-triggered control (ETC) framework for mitigating congestion in such systems, which are modeled using an extended Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) formulation consisting of coupled 4 x 4 hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Ramp metering is employed as the boundary actuation mechanism. To reduce computational and communication burdens while avoiding excessive ramp signal changes, we design the ETC strategy based on the backstepping method, together with an observer-based ETC formulation for practical implementation under limited sensing. Rigorous Lyapunov analysis ensures exponential convergence and avoidance of Zeno behavior. Extensive simulations validate the proposed approach under diverse traffic scenarios, including varying AV penetration rates, different spacing policies, multiple demand levels, and non-recurrent congestion patterns. Results show that ETC not only stabilizes mixed traffic flows but also significantly reduces control updates, improving driver comfort, and roadway safety. Higher AV penetration rates lead to longer release time and fewer triggering events, indicating the positive impact of AVs in mitigating traffic congestion while reducing computational resource usage. Compared to continuous backstepping controllers, the proposed ETC achieves near-equivalent stabilization performance with far fewer controller updates, resulting in longer signal release time that reduces driver distraction, which demonstrates great potential for ETC applications in traffic management."

However, existing methods often oversimplify the anomaly space by treating all abnormal events as a single category, overlooking the diverse semantic and temporal characteristics intrinsic to real-world anomalies. Inspired by how humans perceive anomalies, by jointly interpreting temporal motion patterns and semantic structures underlying different anomaly types, we propose RefineVAD, a novel framework that mimics this dual-process reasoning. Our framework integrates two core modules. The first, Motion-aware Temporal Attention and Recalibration (MoTAR), estimates motion salience and dynamically adjusts temporal focus via shift-based attention and global Transformer-based modeling. The second, Category-Oriented Refinement (CORE), injects soft anomaly category priors into the representation space by aligning segment-level features with learnable category prototypes through cross-attention. By jointly leveraging temporal dynamics and semantic structure, explicitly models both \"how\" motion evolves and \"what\" semantic category it resembles. Extensive experiments on WVAD benchmark validate the effectiveness of RefineVAD and highlight the importance of integrating semantic context to guide feature refinement toward anomaly-relevant patterns."

In recent research, graph structures have been integrated into RAG to enhance the capture of semantic relations between entities. However, it primarily focuses on low-order pairwise entity relations, limiting the high-order associations among multiple entities. Hypergraph-enhanced approaches address this limitation by modeling multi-entity interactions via hyperedges, but they are typically constrained to inter-chunk entity-level representations, overlooking the global thematic organization and alignment across chunks. Drawing inspiration from the top-down cognitive process of human reasoning, we propose a theme-aligned dual-hypergraph RAG framework (Cog-RAG) that uses a theme hypergraph to capture inter-chunk thematic structure and an entity hypergraph to model high-order semantic relations. Furthermore, we design a cognitive-inspired two-stage retrieval strategy that first activates query-relevant thematic content from the theme hypergraph, and then guides fine-grained recall and diffusion in the entity hypergraph, achieving semantic alignment and consistent generation from global themes to local details. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Cog-RAG significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline approaches."

Although recent advances in generative models have enabled visually compelling painting synthesis, most existing methods focus solely on final image generation or patch-based process simulation, lacking explicit stroke structure and failing to produce smooth, realistic shading. In this work, we present a differentiable stroke reconstruction framework that unifies painting, stylized texturing, and smudging to faithfully reproduce the human painting-smudging loop. Given an input image, our framework first optimizes single- and dual-color Bezier strokes through a parallel differentiable paint renderer, followed by a style generation module that synthesizes geometry-conditioned textures across diverse painting styles. We further introduce a differentiable smudge operator to enable natural color blending and shading. Coupled with a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy, our method jointly optimizes stroke geometry, color, and texture under geometric and semantic guidance. Extensive experiments on oil, watercolor, ink, and digital paintings demonstrate that our approach produces realistic and expressive stroke reconstructions, smooth tonal transitions, and richly stylized appearances, offering a unified model for expressive digital painting creation.

However, enabling robust video spatial reasoning-the ability to comprehend object locations, orientations, and inter-object relationships in dynamic 3D scenes-remains a key unsolved challenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on spatially grounded supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, yet we observe that such models often exhibit query-locked reasoning, focusing narrowly on objects explicitly mentioned in the prompt while ignoring critical contextual cues. To address this limitation, we propose Object-Centric 3D Rollout (OCR), a novel strategy that introduces structured perturbations to the 3D geometry of selected objects during training. By degrading object-specific visual cues and projecting the altered geometry into 2D space, OCR compels the model to reason holistically across the entire scene. We further design a rollout-based training pipeline that jointly leverages vanilla and region-noisy videos to optimize spatial reasoning trajectories. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: our 3B-parameter model achieves 47.5% accuracy on VSI-Bench, outperforming several 7B baselines. Ablations confirm OCR's superiority over prior rollout strategies (e.g., T-GRPO, NoisyRollout)."

    "abstract": "Pedestrians in crowds frequently move as part of small groups, constituting up to 70% of individuals. Dyads (groups of two) are the most frequent. Understanding quantitatively the dynamics of dyads walking in crowds is therefore an essential building block towards a fundamental comprehension of crowd behavior as a whole, and mandatory for accurate crowd dynamics models. Unavoidably, due to the non-deterministic behavior of pedestrians, characterizations of the dynamics must be probabilistic. In this work, we analyze the dynamics of over 6M dyads: a statistical ensemble of unprecedented resolution within a multi-year real-life pedestrian trajectory measurement campaign (21M trajectories, from Eindhoven Station, NL). We provide phenomenological models for dyad behavior in dependence of the surrounding crowds state. We present a thorough collection of fundamental diagrams that probabilistically relate both dyad velocity and formation to the state of the surrounding crowd (density, relative velocity). Depending on the surrounding crowd, dyads adjust interpersonal distance and may shift in formation, possibly turning from abreast states (which favors social interaction) to in-line (which favors navigationing dense crowds). To quantitatively investigate formation changes, we introduce a scalar indicator, which we dub Orientation Log-Odds (OLO), that quantifies the relative log-likelihood of abreast versus in-file formations. Conceptually, the OLO quantifies energy difference of the abreast vs. in-file configuration under a Boltzmann-like assumption. We model how OLO depends on the crowd state, showcasing that its derivative is a product of two velocity-density fundamental diagrams. Together, these results provide a statistically robust, data-driven description of dyad configuration dynamics in real-world crowds, establishing a foundation towards new predictive, group-aware crowd models."

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based methods have shown great promise in single image super-resolution (SISR); however, existing approaches often produce blurred fine details due to insufficient guidance in the high-frequency domain. To address this issue, we propose a High-Frequency Guided Diffusion Network based on Wavelet Decomposition (HDW-SR), which replaces the conventional U-Net backbone in diffusion frameworks. Specifically, we perform diffusion only on the residual map, allowing the network to focus more effectively on high-frequency information restoration. We then introduce wavelet-based downsampling in place of standard CNN downsampling to achieve multi-scale frequency decomposition, enabling sparse cross-attention between the high-frequency subbands of the pre-super-resolved image and the low-frequency subbands of the diffused image for explicit high-frequency guidance. Moreover, a Dynamic Thresholding Block (DTB) is designed to refine high-frequency selection during the sparse attention process. During upsampling, the invertibility of the wavelet transform ensures low-loss feature reconstruction. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that HDW-SR achieves competitive super-resolution performance, excelling particularly in recovering fine-grained image details. The code will be available after acceptance."

To solve this, we introduce the first publicly available, 20,000-row Bangla corpus, manually annotated to explicitly distinguish between these two phenomena in noisy ASR transcripts. We benchmark this novel resource using two paradigms: state-of-the-art multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) and task-specific fine-tuning of encoder models. LLMs achieve competitive performance (up to 82.68\\% accuracy) with few-shot prompting. However, fine-tuning proves superior, with the language-specific BanglaBERT model achieving the highest accuracy of 84.78\\% and an F1 score of 0.677.

To address communication costs while embracing data heterogeneity, we propose pFed1BS, a novel personalized federated learning framework that achieves extreme communication compression through one-bit random sketching. In personalized FL, the goal shifts from training a single global model to creating tailored models for each client. In our framework, clients transmit highly compressed one-bit sketches, and the server aggregates and broadcasts a global one-bit consensus. To enable effective personalization, we introduce a sign-based regularizer that guides local models to align with the global consensus while preserving local data characteristics. To mitigate the computational burden of random sketching, we employ the Fast Hadamard Transform for efficient projection. Theoretical analysis guarantees that our algorithm converges to a stationary neighborhood of the global potential function. Numerical simulations demonstrate that pFed1BS substantially reduces communication costs while achieving competitive performance compared to advanced communication-efficient FL algorithms."

Digital phenotyping offers a potential solution, yet existing tools fail to balance scalable non-manual phenotype generation and biological interpretability of these quantitative traits. Here we report AIPheno, the first generative AI-driven \"phenotype sequencer\" that bridges this gap. It enables high-throughput, unsupervised extraction of digital phenotypes from imaging data and unlocks their biological meaning via generative network analysis. AIPheno transforms imaging modalities into a rich source of quantitative traits, dramatically enhancing cross-species genetic discovery, including novel loci such as CCBE1 (humans), KITLG-TMTC3 (domestic pigeons), and SOD2-IGF2R (swine). Critically, its generative module decodes AI-derived phenotypes by synthesizing variant-specific images to yield actionable biological insights. For example, it clarifies how the OCA2-HERC2 locus pleiotropically links pigmentation to retinal vascular traits via vascular visibility modulation. Integrating scalable non-manual phenotyping, enhanced genetic discovery power, and generative mechanistic decoding, AIPheno establishes a transformative closed-loop paradigm.

Two types of external-field setups are considered: One is a circularly polarized electromagnetic field and the other is a combination of a circularly polarized electric field and a static magnetic field. The system is modeled by a classical frustrated Heisenberg model on a triangular lattice, whose ground state is a single-$Q$ spiral spin configuration. The effects of irradiated electric and magnetic fields are taken into account by the inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction and the Zeeman coupling, respectively, without heating effects. By numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we find that the two field configurations lead to distinct skyrmion crystal (SkX) phases and their associated topological phase transitions: in the former setup, SkXs composed of skyrmions with skyrmion numbers of one and two with opposite signs emerge, whereas in the latter setup, SkXs with the same sign appear. The stabilization mechanisms of these SkXs are accounted for by the competition among electromagnetic-field-induced chiral DM interactions, electric-field-induced three-spin interactions, and the Zeeman coupling based on the high-frequency expansion within the Floquet formalism. Furthermore, for the latter setup, we find that the stability region of the SkX phase varies significantly depending on the timing of the application of the circularly polarized electric field and the static magnetic field. Our findings would broaden the possible routes to generate and control SkXs by time-dependent electromagnetic fields, advancing both the theoretical comprehension and experimental control of topological spin crystals."

For region-wise representation, the GPS trajectories are first mapped to grid sequences, and spatial context are captured by structural features and semantic context enriched by visual features. For point-wise representation, three lightweight expert networks extract local, correlation, and continuous movement patterns from dense GPS sequences. Then, a router network adaptively fuses the learned point-wise features, which are subsequently combined with region-wise features using cross-attention to produce the final trajectory embedding.

However, existing approaches are primarily designed for modest viewpoint variations, which struggle in capturing fine-grained details in close-up scenarios since input information is severely limited. In this paper, we present a diffusion-based framework, called CloseUpShot, for close-up novel view synthesis from sparse inputs via point-conditioned video diffusion. Specifically, we observe that pixel-warping conditioning suffers from severe sparsity and background leakage in close-up settings. To address this, we propose hierarchical warping and occlusion-aware noise suppression, enhancing the quality and completeness of the conditioning images for the video diffusion model. Furthermore, we introduce global structure guidance, which leverages a dense fused point cloud to provide consistent geometric context to the diffusion process, to compensate for the lack of globally consistent 3D constraints in sparse conditioning inputs. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, especially in close-up novel view synthesis, clearly validating the effectiveness of our design."

    "abstract": "Zero-shot event extraction (ZSEE) remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to the need for complex reasoning and domain-specific understanding. Direct prompting often yields incomplete or structurally invalid outputs--such as misclassified triggers, missing arguments, and schema violations. To address these limitations, we present Agent-Event-Coder (AEC), a novel multi-agent framework that treats event extraction like software engineering: as a structured, iterative code-generation process. AEC decomposes ZSEE into specialized subtasks--retrieval, planning, coding, and verification--each handled by a dedicated LLM agent. Event schemas are represented as executable class definitions, enabling deterministic validation and precise feedback via a verification agent. This programming-inspired approach allows for systematic disambiguation and schema enforcement through iterative refinement. By leveraging collaborative agent workflows, AEC enables LLMs to produce precise, complete, and schema-consistent extractions in zero-shot settings. Experiments across five diverse domains and six LLMs demonstrate that AEC consistently outperforms prior zero-shot baselines, showcasing the power of treating event extraction like code generation. The code and data are released on https://github.com/UESTC-GQJ/Agent-Event-Coder."

While existing deraining methods have made considerable progress, they often struggle with fidelity of semantic and spatial details. To address these limitations, we propose the Multi-Prior Hierarchical Mamba (MPHM) network for image deraining. This novel architecture synergistically integrates macro-semantic textual priors (CLIP) for task-level semantic guidance and micro-structural visual priors (DINOv2) for scene-aware structural information. To alleviate potential conflicts between heterogeneous priors, we devise a progressive Priors Fusion Injection (PFI) that strategically injects complementary cues at different decoder levels. Meanwhile, we equip the backbone network with an elaborate Hierarchical Mamba Module (HMM) to facilitate robust feature representation, featuring a Fourier-enhanced dual-path design that concurrently addresses global context modeling and local detail recovery. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate MPHM's state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 0.57 dB PSNR gain on the Rain200H dataset while delivering superior generalization on real-world rainy scenarios."

    "abstract": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise for large-scale network control, yet existing methods face two major limitations. First, they typically rely on assumptions leading to decay properties of local agent interactions, limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies such as cascading power failures or epidemic outbreaks. Second, most approaches lack generalizability across network topologies, requiring retraining when applied to new graphs. We introduce STACCA (Shared Transformer Actor-Critic with Counterfactual Advantage), a unified transformer-based MARL framework that addresses both challenges. STACCA employs a centralized Graph Transformer Critic to model long-range dependencies and provide system-level feedback, while its shared Graph Transformer Actor learns a generalizable policy capable of adapting across diverse network structures. Further, to improve credit assignment during training, STACCA integrates a novel counterfactual advantage estimator that is compatible with state-value critic estimates. We evaluate STACCA on epidemic containment and rumor-spreading network control tasks, demonstrating improved performance, network generalization, and scalability. These results highlight the potential of transformer-based MARL architectures to achieve scalable and generalizable control in large-scale networked systems."

By observing the evolution of these caustic-linked wave packets, we directly visualize both the geometric phase and the Gouy phase. This visual detection method provides new insight into geometric phases in complex optical fields and expands the possibilities for designing optical systems that exploit phase geometry."

    "abstract": "Low-cost micro-electromechanical accelerometers are widely used in navigation, robotics, and consumer devices for motion sensing and position estimation. However, their performance is often degraded by bias errors. To eliminate deterministic bias terms a calibration procedure is applied under stationary conditions. It requires accelerom- eter leveling or complex orientation-dependent calibration procedures. To overcome those requirements, in this paper we present a model-free learning-based calibration method that estimates accelerometer bias under stationary conditions, without requiring knowledge of the sensor orientation and without the need to rotate the sensors. The proposed approach provides a fast, practical, and scalable solution suitable for rapid field deployment. Experimental validation on a 13.39-hour dataset collected from six accelerometers shows that the proposed method consistently achieves error levels more than 52% lower than traditional techniques. On a broader scale, this work contributes to the advancement of accurate calibration methods in orientation-free scenarios. As a consequence, it improves the reliability of low-cost inertial sensors in diverse scientific and industrial applications and eliminates the need for leveled calibration."

The benchmark introduces 15 corruption types at 5 severity levels across CASIA-B, CCPG, and SUSTech1K, with in-the-wild validation on MEVID, and evaluates six state-of-the-art gait systems. We came across several exciting insights. First, applying noise at the RGB level better reflects real-world degradation, and reveal how distortions propagate through silhouette extraction to the downstream gait recognition systems. Second, gait accuracy is highly sensitive to silhouette extractor biases, revealing an overlooked source of benchmark bias. Third, robustness is dependent on both the type of perturbation and the architectural design. Finally, we explore robustness-enhancing strategies, showing that noise-aware training and knowledge distillation improve performance and move toward deployment-ready systems."

We extend this inequality to prox-regular and weakly convex settings, obtaining robust guarantees beyond the convex case. We also give an operational recipe for estimating and monitoring the four terms via simple $2\\times 2$ randomized experiments and streaming diagnostics (effective sample size, clipping rate, interaction heatmaps).

    "abstract": "Modern autonomous systems are driving the critical need for next-generation adaptive materials and structures with embodied intelligence, i.e., the embodiment of memory, perception, learning, and decision-making within the mechanical domain. A fundamental challenge is the seamless and efficient integration of memory with information processing in a physically interpretable way that enables cognitive learning and decision-making under uncertainty. Prevailing paradigms, from intricate logic cascades to black-box morphological computing or physical neural networks, are seriously limited by trade-offs among efficiency, scalability, interpretability, transparency, and reliance on additional electronics. Here, we introduce in-memory phononic learning, a paradigm-shifting framework that unifies nonvolatile mechanical memory with wave-based perception within a phononic metastructure. Our system encodes spatial information into stable structural states as mechanical memory that directly programs its elastic wave-propagation landscape. This memory/wave-dynamics coupling enables effective sensory perception, decomposing complex patterns into informative geometric features through frequency-selective wave localization. Learning is created by optimizing input waveforms to selectively probe these features for memory-pattern classification, with decisions inferred directly from the output wave energy, thereby completing the entire information loop mechanically through an efficient and physically transparent mechanism without hidden architectures or electronics. This work transcends the paradigm of 'materials that compute' to cognitive matter capable of interpreting dynamic environments, paving the way for future intelligent structural-material systems with low power consumption, more direct interaction with surroundings, and enhanced cybersecurity and resilience in harsh conditions."

We present BootOOD, a fully self-supervised OOD detection framework that bootstraps exclusively from ID data and is explicitly designed to handle semantically challenging OOD samples. BootOOD synthesizes pseudo-OOD features through simple transformations of ID representations and leverages Neural Collapse (NC), where ID features cluster tightly around class means with consistent feature norms. Unlike prior approaches that aim to constrain OOD features into subspaces orthogonal to the collapsed ID means, BootOOD introduces a lightweight auxiliary head that performs radius-based classification on feature norms. This design decouples OOD detection from the primary classifier and imposes a relaxed requirement: OOD samples are learned to have smaller feature norms than ID features, which is easier to satisfy when ID and OOD are semantically close. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-200 show that BootOOD outperforms prior post-hoc methods, surpasses training-based methods without outlier exposure, and is competitive with state-of-the-art outlier-exposure approaches while maintaining or improving ID accuracy."

In Europe, multi-year storage reduces system costs by 4.1%, fossil imports by 86%, and curtailment by 60%. The benefit of multi-year storage is that a renewable surplus in one year is not curtailed but converted to synthetic oil, with hydrogen as an intermediate product, and stored to balance a future deficit. We find that the required energy capacity for liquid hydrocarbons is 525 TWh, a quarter of the European Union's current oil and gas reserves, complemented by 116 TWh for hydrogen storage. Security of supply remains high and unserved energy only amounts to 0.0035 per thousand, well below the common target of 0.02 per thousand."

The limit of steepness is imposed, among others, by such factors as the efficiency of pedalling, which is related -- among others -- to feasible cadence, maintaining balance and preventing skidding of the rear wheel. This article, however, is focused on the primary issue of power available to the cyclist, which can be viewed as a necessary condition to examine other aspects of climbing strategy. We show that -- for given start and end points, and for any fixed average-power constraint -- the brachistochrone, which is the trajectory of minimum ascent time, is the straight line connecting these points, covered with a constant speed, which along such a line is equivalent to a constant power. This is in contrast to the classical solution of a descent brachistochrone under gravity, which is a cycloid along which the speed is not constant."

Less important messages can be censored in order to save energy for later communications. The problem is modeled using a joint Markov Decision Process of the whole network dynamics, and a theoretically optimal censoring policy, which maximizes a long-term reward, is found. Though the optimal censoring rules are computationally prohibitive, our analysis suggests that, under some conditions, they can be approximated by a finite collection of constant-threshold rules. A centralized algorithm for the computation of these thresholds is proposed. The experimental simulations show that cooperative censoring policies are energy-efficient, and outperform other non-cooperative schemes."

We aim to derive precise constraints on WASP-80 b's bulk metal mass fraction, atmospheric composition, and thermal structure. We conducted a suite of retrievals using three approaches: traditional interior-only, atmosphere-only, and joint interior-atmosphere retrievals. We coupled the open-source models GASTLI and petitRADTRANS, which describe planetary structure and thermal evolution, and atmospheric chemistry and clouds, respectively. Our retrievals combine mass and age with panchromatic spectra from JWST and HST in both transmission (0.5-4 $μ$m) and emission (1-12 $μ$m) as observational constraints. We identify two fiducial scenarios. In the first, WASP-80 b has an internal temperature consistent with its age in the absence of external heating sources, and its atmosphere is in chemical equilibrium, with an atmospheric metallicity M/H = 2.75$^{+0.88}_{-0.56}$x solar, a bulk metal mass fraction $Z_{planet}=0.12\\pm0.02$, and a core mass $M_{core}=3.49^{+3.49}_{-1.59} \\ M_{\\oplus}$. In the second scenario, WASP-80 b may be inflated by an additional heat source - possibly induced by magnetic fields - with an atmospheric metallicity M/H = 10.00$^{+8.20}_{-4.75}$x solar, $Z_{planet}=0.28\\pm0.11$, and $M_{core}=31.8^{+21.3}_{-17.5} \\ M_{\\oplus}$. The super-solar M/H and sub-solar C/O ratios in both scenarios suggest late pebble or planetesimal accretion, while additional heating is required to reconcile the data with the more massive core predicted by the core accretion paradigm. In general, joint retrievals are inherently affected by a degeneracy between atmospheric chemistry and internal structure. Together with flexible cloud treatment and an unweighted likelihood, this leads to larger uncertainties in bulk and atmospheric compositions than previously claimed."

    "abstract": "Understanding sentiment in financial documents is crucial for gaining insights into market behavior. These reports often contain obfuscated language designed to present a positive or neutral outlook, even when underlying conditions may be less favorable. This paper presents a novel approach using Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) to decode obfuscated sentiment in Thai financial annual reports. We develop specific guidelines for annotating obfuscated sentiment in these texts and annotate more than one hundred financial reports. We then benchmark various text classification models on this annotated dataset, demonstrating strong performance in sentiment classification. Additionally, we conduct an event study to evaluate the real-world implications of our sentiment analysis on stock prices. Our results suggest that market reactions are selectively influenced by specific aspects within the reports. Our findings underscore the complexity of sentiment analysis in financial texts and highlight the importance of addressing obfuscated language to accurately assess market sentiment."

    "abstract": "Magnetic imaging techniques are widespread critical tools used in fields such as magnetism, spintronics or even superconductivity. Among them, one of the most versatile methods is the magneto-optical Kerr effect. However, as soon as light is blocked from interacting with the magnetic layer, such as in deeply buried layers, optical techniques become ineffective. In this work, we present a spin-accumulation based magneto-optical Kerr effect (SA-MOKE) microscopy technique that enables imaging of a magnetic thin-films covered by thick and opaque metallic layers. The technique is based on the generation and detection of transient spin-accumulations that propagate through the thick metallic layer. These spin-accumulation signals are directly triggered and detected optically on the same side, lifting any substrate transparency requirements. The spin-accumulation signals detected on a Cu layer decay with a characteristic length of 60 nm, much longer than the 12 nm optical penetration depth, allowing for detection of magnetic contrast with Cu capping layers up to hundreds of nm. This method should enable magnetic imaging in a wide-range of experiments where the surface of interest is covered by electrodes."

    "abstract": "Analytic Translation Quality Evaluation (TQE), based on Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM), traditionally uses a linear error-to-penalty scale calibrated to a reference sample of 1000-2000 words. However, linear extrapolation biases judgment on samples of different sizes, over-penalizing short samples and under-penalizing long ones, producing misalignment with expert intuition. Building on the Multi-Range framework, this paper presents a calibrated, non-linear scoring model that better reflects how human content consumers perceive translation quality across samples of varying length. Empirical data from three large-scale enterprise environments shows that acceptable error counts grow logarithmically, not linearly, with sample size. Psychophysical and cognitive evidence, including the Weber-Fechner law and Cognitive Load Theory, supports this premise by explaining why the perceptual impact of additional errors diminishes while the cognitive burden grows with scale. We propose a two-parameter model E(x) = a * ln(1 + b * x), a, b > 0, anchored to a reference tolerance and calibrated from two tolerance points using a one-dimensional root-finding step. The model yields an explicit interval within which the linear approximation stays within +/-20 percent relative error and integrates into existing evaluation workflows with only a dynamic tolerance function added. The approach improves interpretability, fairness, and inter-rater reliability across both human and AI-generated translations. By operationalizing a perceptually valid scoring paradigm, it advances translation quality evaluation toward more accurate and scalable assessment. The model also provides a stronger basis for AI-based document-level evaluation aligned with human judgment. Implementation considerations for CAT/LQA systems and implications for human and AI-generated text evaluation are discussed."

Our study reveals that the interplay between nonreciprocity, quasiperiodicity, and the power-law exponent $p$ gives rise to a variety of phase transitions and localization phenomena. In the Hermitian case, the system undergoes a direct transition from extended to localized phases for $p=1, 2$, while for \\(p \\geq 3\\), an intermediate mixed phase emerges, characterized by the coexistence of extended and localized states and the presence of mobility edges. Importantly, we find that high inverse participation ratio (IPR) states appear at specific energy levels, whose positions are accurately described by the universal relation \\(x_n = nβ- \\lfloor nβ\\rfloor\\), with a mirror-symmetric spatial distribution. In the non-Hermitian regime, the energy spectrum becomes complex and the \\(\\mathcal{PT}\\) transition coincides with the extended-to-localized phase boundary for \\(p = 1, 2\\), whereas for \\(p \\geq 3\\), \\(\\mathcal{PT}\\)-symmetry breaking occurs at the mixed-to-localized phase transition.

The goal is to drive large populations of interacting agents toward consensus with minimal control effort.

The resulting nonsmooth optimization problem is solved via a three-operator splitting (TOS) method that separately handles smooth, nonsmooth, and constraint components through gradient, shrinkage, and projection steps. A particle-based Monte Carlo discretization with random batch interactions enables scalable computation while preserving the mean-field structure. Numerical experiments on the Cucker-Smale model demonstrate effective consensus formation with sparse, localized control actions, confirming the efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) technologies, including multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and diffusion models, image generation and manipulation have become remarkably effortless. Existing image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) methods often struggle to generalize across diverse datasets and offer limited interpretability. Nowadays, MLLMs demonstrate strong generalization potential across diverse vision-language tasks, and some studies introduce this capability to IFDL via large-scale training. However, such approaches cost considerable computational resources, while failing to reveal the inherent generalization potential of vanilla MLLMs to address this problem. Inspired by this observation, we propose Foresee, a training-free MLLM-based pipeline tailored for image forgery analysis. It eliminates the need for additional training and enables a lightweight inference process, while surpassing existing MLLM-based methods in both tamper localization accuracy and the richness of textual explanations. Foresee employs a type-prior-driven strategy and utilizes a Flexible Feature Detector (FFD) module to specifically handle copy-move manipulations, thereby effectively unleashing the potential of vanilla MLLMs in the forensic domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves superior localization accuracy and provides more comprehensive textual explanations. Moreover, Foresee exhibits stronger generalization capability, outperforming existing IFDL methods across various tampering types, including copy-move, splicing, removal, local enhancement, deepfake, and AIGC-based editing. The code will be released in the final version."

Long-range flights often trigger frequent inter-cell handovers, which may introduce delays and synchronization overhead. We jointly optimize the continuous trajectory and BS association to minimize handovers, path length, and flying time, subject to communication reliability and kinematic constraints. To address this problem, we reformulate it as an optimization based on the graph of convex sets (GCS). First, the URLLC requirement is translated into spatially feasible regions in the flight plane for each BS. And an intersection graph is constructed including the start and goal points. Each graph node is associated with a smooth and dynamically feasible trajectory segment. The trajectory is parameterized in space by Bézier curves and in time by a monotonic Bézier scaling, together with convex constraints that ensure continuity and enforce speed bounds. Next, we impose unit-flow constraints to enforce a single path, and by coupling the resulting binary edge-selection variables with the convex constraints, we obtain a mixed-integer convex program (MICP). Applying a convex relaxation and rounding to the mixed-integer convex program produces nearly globally optimal routes, and a final refinement yields smooth, dynamically feasible trajectories. Simulations verify that the method preserves URLLC connectivity while achieving a clear trade-off between fewer handovers and flight efficiency."

These are right-invariant Lagrangians defined on the tangent bundle of a half-Lie group with quadratic growth on each fiber. The main examples of half-Lie groups are groups of $H^s$ or $C^k$ diffeomorphisms of compact manifolds. We show that the Euler--Lagrange flow exists globally. We then introduce three thresholds of the energy, called the Ma~ne critical values, and prove that under mild regularity and completeness assumptions on the half-Lie group, any two points can be connected by a global Tonelli minimizer above the lowest of these energy thresholds. Under an additional assumption on the Lagrangian, such a minimizer is a flow line of the Euler--Lagrange flow. This extends the work of Contreras from closed finite-dimensional manifolds to the infinite-dimensional context. Moreover, our results also extend the recent work of Bauer, Harms, and Michor from geodesic flows to Euler--Lagrange flows of Tonelli Lagrangians. As an application, we obtain global well-posedness of all Euler--Poincare'e equations associated with Tonelli Lagrangians on half-Lie groups equipped with strong right-invariant Riemannian metrics."

    "abstract": "While data scaling laws of large language models (LLMs) have been widely examined in the one-pass regime with massive corpora, their form under limited data and repeated epochs remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of how a common workaround, training for multiple epochs on the same dataset, reshapes the data scaling laws in linear regression. Concretely, we ask: to match the performance of training on a dataset of size $N$ for $K$ epochs, how much larger must a dataset be if the model is trained for only one pass? We quantify this using the \\textit{effective reuse rate} of the data, $E(K, N)$, which we define as the multiplicative factor by which the dataset must grow under one-pass training to achieve the same test loss as $K$-epoch training. Our analysis precisely characterizes the scaling behavior of $E(K, N)$ for SGD in linear regression under either strong convexity or Zipf-distributed data: (1) When $K$ is small, we prove that $E(K, N) \\approx K$, indicating that every new epoch yields a linear gain; (2) As $K$ increases, $E(K, N)$ plateaus at a problem-dependent value that grows with $N$ ($Θ(\\log N)$ for the strongly-convex case), implying that larger datasets can be repeated more times before the marginal benefit vanishes. These theoretical findings point out a neglected factor in a recent empirical study (Muennighoff et al. (2023)), which claimed that training LLMs for up to $4$ epochs results in negligible loss differences compared to using fresh data at each step, \\textit{i.e.}, $E(K, N) \\approx K$ for $K \\le 4$ in our notation. Supported by further empirical validation with LLMs, our results reveal that the maximum $K$ value for which $E(K, N) \\approx K$ in fact depends on the data size and distribution, and underscore the need to explicitly model both factors in future studies of scaling laws with data reuse."

However, little attention has been paid to hallucinations in voluntary imagination tasks, e.g., story writing, where the models are expected to generate novel content beyond the given image. In these tasks, it is inappropriate to simply regard such imagined novel content as hallucinations. To address this limitation, we introduce Voluntary-imagined Object Presence Evaluation (VOPE)-a novel method to assess LVLMs' hallucinations in voluntary imagination tasks via presence evaluation. Specifically, VOPE poses recheck-based questions to evaluate how an LVLM interprets the presence of the imagined objects in its own response. The consistency between the model's interpretation and the object's presence in the image is then used to determine whether the model hallucinates when generating the response. We apply VOPE to several mainstream LVLMs and hallucination mitigation methods, revealing two key findings: (1) most LVLMs hallucinate heavily during voluntary imagination, and their performance in presence evaluation is notably poor on imagined objects; (2) existing hallucination mitigation methods show limited effect in voluntary imagination tasks, making this an important direction for future research."

AGREE leverages cross-modal attention from multimodal large language models as proxy local supervision to guide the identification of relevant document regions.

Experiments on the challenging ViDoRe V2 benchmark show that AGREE significantly outperforms the global-supervision-only baseline. Quantitative and qualitative analyses further demonstrate that AGREE promotes deeper alignment between query terms and document regions, moving beyond surface-level matching toward more accurate and interpretable retrieval.

    "abstract": "Quantum algorithms based on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have enabled a wide range of applications on near-term quantum devices. However, existing PQC architectures face several challenges, among which the ``barren plateaus\" phenomenon is particularly prominent. In such cases, the loss function concentrates exponentially with increasing system size, thereby hindering effective parameter optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a general and hardware-efficient method for eliminating barren plateaus in an arbitrary PQC. Specifically, our approach achieves this by inserting a layer of easily implementable quantum channels into the original PQC, each channel requiring only one ancilla qubit and four additional gates, yielding a modified PQC (MPQC) that is provably at least as expressive as the original PQC and, under mild assumptions, is guaranteed to be free from barren plateaus. Furthermore, by appropriately adjusting the structure of MPQCs, we rigorously prove that any parameter in the original PQC can be made trainable. Importantly, the absence of barren plateaus in MPQCs is robust against realistic noise, making our approach directly applicable to current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Numerically, we demonstrate the practicality of our method by modifying a commonly used PQC for thermal-state preparation. The results show that {barren plateaus are effectively eliminated} in this class of circuits with up to 100 qubits and 2400 layers, whereas the original ansatz suffers from severe gradient vanishing."

    "abstract": "We have carried out a detailed analysis of the 3.4 micron spectral feature arising from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH), using JWST archival data. For the first time in an external galaxy (NGC 6240), we have identified two distinct spectral components of the PAH 3.4 micron feature: a shorter wavelength component at 3.395 micron, which we attribute to short aliphatic chains tightly attached to the aromatic rings of the PAH molecules; and a longer wavelength feature at 3.405 microns that arises from longer, more fragile, aliphatic chains that are weakly attached to the parent PAH molecule. These longer chains are more easily destroyed by far-ultraviolet photons (>5eV) and PAH thermal emission only occurs where PAH molecules are shielded from more energetic photons by dense molecular gas. We see a very strong correlation in the morphology of the PAH 3.395 micron feature with the PAH 3.3 micron emission, the latter arising from robust aromatic PAH molecules. We also see an equally strong correlation between the PAH 3.405 micron morphology and the warm molecular gas, as traced by H2 vibrational lines. We show that the flux ratio PAH_3.395/PAH_3.405 < 0.3 corresponds strongly to regions where the PAH molecules are shielded by dense molecular gas, so that only modestly energetic UV photons penetrate to excite the PAHs. Our work shows that PAH 3.405 micron and PAH 3.395 micron emission features can provide robust diagnostics of the physical conditions of the interstellar medium in external galaxies, and can be used to quantify the energies of the photon field penetrating molecular clouds."

    "abstract": "Since Isaac Newton first studied the Kissing Number Problem in 1694, determining the maximal number of non-overlapping spheres around a central sphere has remained a fundamental challenge. This problem represents the local analogue of Hilbert's 18th problem on sphere packing, bridging geometry, number theory, and information theory. Although significant progress has been made through lattices and codes, the irregularities of high-dimensional geometry and exponentially growing combinatorial complexity beyond 8 dimensions, which exceeds the complexity of Go game, limit the scalability of existing methods. Here we model this problem as a two-player matrix completion game and train the game-theoretic reinforcement learning system, PackingStar, to efficiently explore high-dimensional spaces. The matrix entries represent pairwise cosines of sphere center vectors; one player fills entries while another corrects suboptimal ones, jointly maximizing the matrix size, corresponding to the kissing number. This cooperative dynamics substantially improves sample quality, making the extremely large spaces tractable. PackingStar reproduces previous configurations and surpasses all human-known records from dimensions 25 to 31, with the configuration in 25 dimensions geometrically corresponding to the Leech lattice and suggesting possible optimality. It achieves the first breakthrough beyond rational structures from 1971 in 13 dimensions and discovers over 6000 new structures in 14 and other dimensions. These results demonstrate AI's power to explore high-dimensional spaces beyond human intuition and open new pathways for the Kissing Number Problem and broader geometry problems."

    "abstract": "We present a novel multiscale numerical approach that combines parallel-in-time computation with hybrid domain adaptation for linear collisional kinetic equations in the diffusive regime. The method addresses the computational challenges of kinetic simulations by integrating two complementary strategies: a parareal temporal parallelization method and a dynamic spatial domain adaptation based on perturbative analysis. The parallel in time approach employs a coarse fluid solver for efficient temporal propagation coupled with a fine, spatially-hybridized, kinetic solver for accurate resolution. Domain adaptation is governed by two criteria: one measuring the deviation from local velocity equilibrium, and another based on macroscopic quantities available throughout the computational domain. An asymptotic preserving micro-macro decomposition framework handles the stiffness of the original problem. This fully hybrid methodology significantly reduces computational costs compared to full kinetic approaches by exploiting the lower dimensionality of asymptotic fluid models while maintaining accuracy through selective kinetic resolution. The method demonstrates substantial speedup capabilities and efficiency gains across various kinetic regimes."

    "abstract": "Diagrams are crucial yet underexplored tools in many disciplines, demonstrating the close connection between visual representation and scholarly reasoning. However, their iconic form poses obstacles to visual studies, intermedial analysis, and text-based digital workflows. In particular, Charles S. Peirce consistently advocated the use of diagrams as essential for reasoning and explanation. His manuscripts, often combining textual content with complex visual artifacts, provide a challenging case for studying documents involving heterogeneous materials. In this preliminary study, we investigate whether Visual Language Models (VLMs) can effectively help us identify and interpret such hybrid pages in context. First, we propose a workflow that (i) segments manuscript page layouts, (ii) reconnects each segment to IIIF-compliant annotations, and (iii) submits fragments containing diagrams to a VLM. In addition, by adopting Peirce's semiotic framework, we designed prompts to extract key knowledge about diagrams and produce concise captions. Finally, we integrated these captions into knowledge graphs, enabling structured representations of diagrammatic content within composite sources."

    "abstract": "The astrophysical site(s) of the r-process are uncertain, with candidates such as neutron star mergers and magneto-rotational supernovae predicting different event rates, delay times, and heavy-element yields. Galactic chemical evolution models constrain these properties by comparing model predictions with observed abundances. We explore, in a systematic and data-driven way, the astrophysical conditions under which r-process enrichment can reproduce the observed trends of multiple neutron-capture elements in the Milky Way. Rather than assuming a fixed site, we adopt a flexible, parametric approach to test whether a common set of r-process parameters can explain the chemical evolution of several heavy elements. We compute a grid of one-infall, homogeneous models varying: Eu yield per event, r-process event rate, enrichment delay time, and progenitor mass range. For each of the $\\sim 1.5 \\times 10^5$ models, we predict [X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] trends by scaling Eu yields with the solar r-process pattern. A multi-objective optimisation based on Pareto fronts identifies models that best reproduce the abundance trends. Best-fitting models favour short delay times ($\\leq 30\\ \\rm Myr$), low-mass progenitors ($\\sim 20-25\\ \\rm M_\\odot$), and an effective Eu injection of $\\sim 2 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\rm M_\\odot$ per event. Stars more massive than $\\sim 80\\ \\rm M_\\odot$ are too rare to dominate the enrichment. While heavy elements can be reproduced, lighter ones show stronger conflicts with Eu, reflecting that the solar r-process scaling relation becomes less valid toward lighter elements. No single class of r-process events, under solar-scaled yields, can explain light and heavy neutron-capture elements; at least two components are required: a main r-process consistent with solar and r-rich stars, and a weaker component producing enhanced light r-process elements, similar to that observed in r-poor stars."

This characterization allows us to apply the Brezzi-Rappaz-Raviart approximation theorem in combination with discrete L p maximal regularity estimates to prove existence of solutions to the semidiscrete MFG system and to derive the error estimate. Finally, for solutions satisfying sufficient regularity assumptions, we establish quasi-optimal error bounds, meaning the approximation achieves the best possible convergence rate when the solution has sufficient smoothness."

    "abstract": "Heritage materials are already affected by climate change, and increasing climatic variations reduces the lifespan of monuments. As weathering depends on many factors, it is also difficult to link its progression to climatic changes. To predict weathering, it is essential to gather climatic data while simultaneously monitoring the progression of deterioration. The multimodal nature of collected data (images, text{\\ldots}) makes correlations difficult, particularly on different time scales. To address this issue, the COLISEUM project proposes a methodology for collecting data in three French sites to predict heritage material behaviour using artificial intelligence computer models. Over time, prediction models will allow the prediction of future material behaviours using known data from different climate change scenarios by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). Thus, a climate monitoring methodology has been set up in three cultural sites in France: Notre-Dame cathedral in Strasbourg ( 67), Bibracte archaeological site (71), and the Saint-Pierre chapel in Villefranche-sur-Mer (06). Each site has a different climate and specific materials. In situ, microclimatic sensors continuously record variations parameters over time. The state of alteration is monitored at regular intervals by means of chemical analyses, cartographic measurements and scientific imaging campaigns. To implement weathering models, data is gathered in alteration matrix by mean of a calculated weathering index. This article presents the instrumentation methodology, the initial diagnostic and the first results with the example of Strasbourg Cathedral site."

    "abstract": "In modern software development workflows, the open-source software supply chain contributes significantly to efficient and convenient engineering practices. With increasing system complexity, using open-source software as third-party dependencies has become a common practice. However, the lack of maintenance for underlying dependencies and insufficient community auditing create challenges in ensuring source code security and the legitimacy of repository maintainers, especially under high-stealthy backdoor attacks exemplified by the XZ-Util incident. To address these problems, we propose a fine-grained project evaluation framework for backdoor risk assessment in open-source software. The framework models stealthy backdoor attacks from the viewpoint of the attacker and defines targeted metrics for each attack stage. In addition, to overcome the limitations of static analysis in assessing the reliability of repository maintenance activities such as irregular committer privilege escalation and limited participation in reviews, the framework uses large language models (LLMs) to conduct semantic evaluation of code repositories without relying on manually crafted patterns. The framework is evaluated on sixty six high-priority packages in the Debian ecosystem. The experimental results indicate that the current open-source software supply chain is exposed to various security risks."

A dual-base-station (BS) architecture is adopted, in which the BSs collaboratively perform integrated sensing of the eavesdropper (the target) and communication tasks. To address the security challenge when the sensing target is located on the main communication link, the problem of maximizing the secrecy rate (SR) under sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio requirements and discrete constraints is formulated. This problem involves the joint optimization of the array pose, the antenna distribution on the array surface, the multi-layer transmitting RIS phase matrices, and the beamforming matrices, which is non-convex. To solve this challenge, an two-stage online algorithm based on the generalized Rayleigh quotient and an offline algorithm based on the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient are proposed. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Compared to conventional schemes without array pose adjustment, the proposed approach achieves approximately 22\\% improvement in SR. Furthermore, array rotation provides higher performance gains than position changes."

Nevertheless, recent research has shown that EaaS is vulnerable to model extraction attacks, which could lead to significant economic losses for model providers. For copyright protection, existing methods inject watermark embeddings into text embeddings and use them to detect copyright infringement. However, current watermarking methods often resist only a subset of attacks and fail to provide \\textit{comprehensive} protection. To this end, we present the region-triggered semantic watermarking framework called RegionMarker, which defines trigger regions within a low-dimensional space and injects watermarks into text embeddings associated with these regions. By utilizing a secret dimensionality reduction matrix to project onto this subspace and randomly selecting trigger regions, RegionMarker makes it difficult for watermark removal attacks to evade detection. Furthermore, by embedding watermarks across the entire trigger region and using the text embedding as the watermark, RegionMarker is resilient to both paraphrasing and dimension-perturbation attacks. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that RegionMarker is effective in resisting different attack methods, thereby protecting the copyright of EaaS."

However, large-scale blockchain data collection remains prohibitively expensive, as many RPC providers only offer enhanced APIs with high pricing tiers that are unsuitable for budget-constrained research or industrial-scale applications, which has significantly slowed down academic studies and product development. Moreover, there is a clear lack of a systematic framework that allows flexible integration of new modules for analyzing on-chain data. To address these challenges, we introduce LinkXplore, the first open framework for collecting and managing on-chain data. LinkXplore enables users to bypass costly blockchain data providers by directly analyzing raw data from RPC queries or streams, thereby offering high-quality blockchain data at a fraction of the cost. Through a simple API and backend processing logic, any type of chain data can be integrated into the framework. This makes it a practical alternative for both researchers and developers with limited budgets.

In this study, we conducted 12-night multicolor optical monitoring using an 85 cm telescope from 2020 September to 2024 June and collected long-term broad-band archived data from radio to $γ$-rays. Intraday variabilities were detected on four nights, and most of them exhibited a bluer-when-brighter behavior. Both clockwise and counterclockwise spectral hysteresis loops were found within a single night. However, no reliable intraband time lag was detected for the intranight variabilities. On long timescales, the cross-correlation analysis shows that the variations of the optical, X-ray, and $γ$-ray bands do not reveal an obvious time delay, while the variations in the radio bands lagged them by about 370 days. The measured time lags suggest two distinct emission regions respectively responsible for the optical to $γ$-ray radiation and for the radio radiation, with a spatial separation of approximately $4.50\\times10^{19}\\ \\rm cm$. We modeled the broad-band spectral energy distributions during four flaring epochs and one quiescent epoch, and found evidence for the possible persistent existence of a very high energy emission region. We also confirmed a spectral evolution of the source from an intermediate synchrotron peaked BL Lac object to a low synchrotron peaked BL Lac object."

Herein, we propose an area-selective wetting strategy for optical fibers, which utilizes hydrophobic sidewalls and hydrophilic end facets to reliably hold small precursor droplets. By introducing a space confinement strategy to suppress the kinetics of solvent evaporation, Methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) perovskite single crystals were successfully grown in-situ on the fiber end facet. The versatility of this in-situ growth method for single crystals on fiber end facets of various sizes has also been verified. In a separate approach, the controllable in-situ preparation of CsPbBr3 polycrystalline thin films was achieved through vacuum-assisted rapid crystallization. Our strategy provides a controllable platform for the integration of perovskite materials and optical fibers, enabling further development in optical applications."

    "abstract": "Human grasps can be roughly categorized into two types: power grasps and precision grasps. Precision grasping enables tool use and is believed to have influenced human evolution. Today's multi-fingered robotic hands are effective in power grasps, but for tasks requiring precision, parallel grippers are still more widely adopted. This contrast highlights a key limitation in current robotic hand design: the difficulty of achieving both stable power grasps and precise, fine-grained manipulation within a single, versatile system. In this work, we bridge this gap by jointly optimizing the control and hardware design of a multi-fingered dexterous hand, enabling both power and precision manipulation. Rather than redesigning the entire hand, we introduce a lightweight fingertip geometry modification, represent it as a contact plane, and jointly optimize its parameters along with the corresponding control. Our control strategy dynamically switches between power and precision manipulation and simplifies precision control into parallel thumb-index motions, which proves robust for sim-to-real transfer. On the design side, we leverage large-scale simulation to optimize the fingertip geometry using a differentiable neural-physics surrogate model. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both sim-to-real and real-to-real settings. Our method achieves an 82.5% zero-shot success rate on unseen objects in sim-to-real precision grasping, and a 93.3% success rate in challenging real-world tasks involving bread pinching. These results demonstrate that our co-design framework can significantly enhance the fine-grained manipulation ability of multi-fingered hands without reducing their ability for power grasps.

Unfortunately, $\\mathsf{CDL}$ turns out to be intractable to even weakly approximate in the offline setting, given black-box access to the predictions and labels. We suggest circumventing this by restricting attention to structured families of post-processing functions $K$. We define the calibration decision loss relative to $K$, denoted $\\mathsf{CDL}_K$ where we consider all proper losses but restrict post-processings to a structured family $K$. We develop a comprehensive theory of when $\\mathsf{CDL}_K$ is information-theoretically and computationally tractable, and use it to prove both upper and lower bounds for natural classes $K$. In addition to introducing new definitions and algorithmic techniques to the theory of calibration for decision making, our results give rigorous guarantees for some widely used recalibration procedures in machine learning."

In this study we analyze the evolution of ion distributions around a reformation cycle of a quasi-parallel shock. We use multi-point in-situ observations in the foreshock region of the Earths bow shock of a transient foreshock structure as it generates a shock. We find that backstreaming ions in the foreshock create a density and magnetic field depletion known as caviton which locally changes the shock geometry. Gyrating suprathermal ions that emerge within the caviton and reach the upstream edge of the core create a cross-field current imbalance that results in the nonlinear growth of a new shock layer. The new shock forms from the background foreshock fields over a distance of ~6 ion inertial lengths ($l_i$) and within 4.5 to 11.2 $l_i$ from the main bow shock. We find that plasma compression at the new thin shock layer is due to compactification of the cold upstream ion beam by high amplitude magnetic field-aligned electrostatic fields. At later stages, the plasma compression expands to form a new sheath."

We used multi-epoch high-resolution FEROS spectra and spectral disentangling paired with stellar templates to derive effective temperatures, $T_\\mathrm{eff}$; stellar radii, R*; and projected rotational velocities, v$\\sin{i}$ for both components in all systems along with the mass ratio, q = $M_\\mathrm{accretor}/M_\\mathrm{donor}$ and the components' flux ratio as a function of wavelength. Results. Our analysis directly confirms that all systems are post-mass-transfer binaries with two luminous stars, i.e. no black hole companions. Each system contains an A-type accretor component that is rapidly rotating and a cooler very low-mass donor (~ 0.25M$\\odot$) that is overluminous. Five of the systems show no trace of any emission lines, implying that there is no current mass transfer, consistent with our inferred radii, in all cases within the Roche volume. The data are generally consistent with stable case AB mass transfer with $β$ (the fraction of mass lost from the accretor) less than 0.7. While the accretor components rotate rapidly, they rotate well below the critical rotation rate, $v_\\mathrm{crit}$, even though there must have been enough mass transfer to spin them up to a significant fraction of $v_\\mathrm{crit}$, according to theoretical models of angular momentum transfer. As neither magnetic braking nor tidal synchronisation should have been effective in spinning down the stars, our results suggest that either mass accretion does not increase the angular momentum of the accretors to their critical values or the systems never reached these values in the first place."

    "abstract": "Let $p_n$ denote the $n$-th prime. In 2000, Panaitopol established the inequality $p_1 \\cdots p_n > p_{n+1}^{n - π(n)}$ for all $n \\geq 2$, where $π(x)$ is the prime counting function. In 2021, Yang and Liao refined this by introducing the exponent $k(n,x) = n - π(n) + \\frac{π(n)}{π(\\log n)} - x \\cdot π(π(n))$, proving the inequality holds for $x = 2$ and $n \\geq 8$. In 2022, Marques and Trojovský extended this to $x = 1.4$ for $n \\geq 21$ and conjectured its validity for $x = 0.1$ when $n \\geq 24,154,953$. This paper confirms the conjecture by analyzing the error term $E_n(x) = \\log(p_1 \\cdots p_n) - k(n,x) \\log p_{n+1}$. Also, we derive the asymptotic expansion to $E_n(x)$ demonstrating that it is positive for all sufficiently large $n$ when $x > -2$. For each $x > -2$, we identify a minimal integer $Ψ(x)$ such that $E_n(x) > 0$ for all $n \\geq Ψ(x)$, precisely determining $Ψ(0.1) = 24,154,953$. Additionally, we establish effective upper bounds for $Ψ(x)$ both unconditionally and under the Riemann Hypothesis, with the conditional bounds showing a significant improvement. Our analysis fully resolves the conjecture and characterizes $Ψ(x)$ as a non-increasing, piecewise constant function, exhibiting discontinuities at a discrete set of threshold points. These results advance the understanding of Bonse-type inequalities and their asymptotic behavior."

    "abstract": "Realizing distributed architectures for quantum computing is crucial to scaling up computational power. A key component of such architectures is a scheduler that coordinates operations over a short-range quantum network required to enable the necessary non-local entangling gates between quantum processing units (QPUs). It is desirable to determine schedules of minimum make span, which in the case of networks with constrained resources hinges on their efficient usage. Here we compare and contrast two approaches to solving the make span minimization problem, an approach based on the resource constrained project scheduling (RCPSP) framework, and another based on a greedy heuristic algorithm. The workflow considered is as follows. Firstly, the computational circuit is partitioned and assigned to different QPUs such that the number of nonlocal entangling gates acting across partitions is minimized while the qubit load is nearly uniform on the individual QPUs, which can be accomplished using, e.g., the METIS solver. Secondly, the nonlocal entangling gate requirements with respect to the partitions are identified, and mapped to network operation sequences that deliver the necessary entanglement between the QPUs. Finally, the network operations are scheduled such that the make span is minimized. As illustrative examples, we analyze the implementation of a small instance of the Quantum Fourier Transform algorithm over instances of a simple hub and spoke (star) network architecture comprised of a quantum switch as the hub and QPUs as spokes, each with a finite qubit resource budget. In one instance, our results show the RCPSP approach outperforming the greedy heuristic. In another instance, we find the two performing equally well. Our results thus illustrate the effectiveness of the RCPSP framework, while also underlining the relevance and usefulness of greedy heuristics."

The source exhibits a stable flux across the entire exposure with no detectable pulsations by any instrument on their X-ray light curves, placing pulsed-fraction upper limits of 10% and 32% for XMM$-$Newton and NuSTAR, respectively. The X-ray spectrum is dominated by two thermal components consistent with the emission from an accretion disk, and shows a weak high-energy tail above 10 keV, with no statistical requirement for an additional nonthermal component. The unabsorbed $0.3-20$ keV luminosity is ${\\sim}2\\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, evidencing the ULX nature of the source. The parameters obtained from spectral modeling are consistent with the hard ultraluminous state.

    "abstract": "Proprietary workflow modeling languages such as Smart Forms & Smart Flow hamper interoperability and reuse because they lock process knowledge into closed formats. To address this vendor lock-in and ease migration to open standards, we introduce an ontology-driven model-to-model pipeline that systematically translates domain-specific workflow definitions to Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0. The pipeline comprises three phases: RML-based semantic lifting of JSON to RDF/OWL, ontology alignment and reasoning, and BPMN generation via the Camunda Model API. By externalizing mapping knowledge into ontologies and declarative rules rather than code, the approach supports reusability across vendor-specific formats and preserves semantic traceability between source definitions and target BPMN models. We instantiated the pipeline for Instituto Superior Técnico (IST)'s Smart Forms & Smart Flow and implemented a converter that produces standard-compliant BPMN diagrams. Evaluation on a corpus of 69 real-world workflows produced 92 BPMN diagrams with a 94.2% success rate. Failures (5.81%) stemmed from dynamic behaviors and time-based transitions not explicit in the static JSON. Interviews with support and development teams indicated that the resulting diagrams provide a top-down view that improves comprehension, diagnosis and onboarding by exposing implicit control flow and linking tasks and forms back to their sources. The pipeline is generalizable to other proprietary workflow languages by adapting the ontology and mappings, enabling interoperability and reducing vendor dependency while supporting continuous integration and long-term maintainability. The presented case study demonstrates that ontology-driven M2M transformation can systematically bridge domain-specific workflows and standard notations, offering quantifiable performance and qualitative benefits for stakeholders."

    "abstract": "The problem of finding short vectors in Euclidean lattices is a central hard problem in complexity theory. The case of module lattices (i.e., lattices which are also modules over a number ring) is of particular interest for cryptography and computational number theory. The hardness of finding short vectors in the asymptotic regime where the rank (as a module) is fixed is supporting the security of quantum-resistant cryptographic standards such as ML-DSA and ML-KEM. In this article we prove the average-case hardness of this problem for uniformly random module lattices (with respect to the natural invariant measure on the space of module lattices of any fixed rank). More specifically, we prove a polynomial-time worst-case to average-case self-reduction for the approximate Shortest Independent Vector Problem ($γ$-SIVP) where the average case is the (discretized) uniform distribution over module lattices, with a polynomially-bounded loss in the approximation factor, assuming the Extended Riemann Hypothesis. This result was previously known only in the rank-1 case (so-called ideal lattices). That proof critically relied on the fact that the space of ideal lattices is a compact group. In higher rank, the space is neither compact nor a group. Our main tool to overcome the resulting challenges is the theory of automorphic forms, which we use to prove a new quantitative rapid equidistribution result for random walks in the space of module lattices."

Supported by theory and experiments, our study spans a variety of practical deployment settings, including centralized training, ensemble learning, and distributed training. We uncover a striking dichotomy: for transfer-based attacks, decreasing the learning rate significantly enhances robustness by up to $64\\%$. In contrast, for query-based attacks, increasing the learning rate consistently leads to improved robustness by up to $28\\%$ across various settings and data distributions. Leveraging these findings, we explore -- for the first time -- the optimization hyperparameter design space to jointly enhance robustness against both transfer-based and query-based attacks. Our results reveal that distributed models benefit the most from hyperparameter tuning, achieving a remarkable tradeoff by simultaneously mitigating both attack types more effectively than other training setups."

    "abstract": "Finding human-understandable circuits in language models is a central goal of the field of mechanistic interpretability. We train models to have more understandable circuits by constraining most of their weights to be zeros, so that each neuron only has a few connections. To recover fine-grained circuits underlying each of several hand-crafted tasks, we prune the models to isolate the part responsible for the task. These circuits often contain neurons and residual channels that correspond to natural concepts, with a small number of straightforwardly interpretable connections between them. We study how these models scale and find that making weights sparser trades off capability for interpretability, and scaling model size improves the capability-interpretability frontier. However, scaling sparse models beyond tens of millions of nonzero parameters while preserving interpretability remains a challenge. In addition to training weight-sparse models de novo, we show preliminary results suggesting our method can also be adapted to explain existing dense models. Our work produces circuits that achieve an unprecedented level of human understandability and validates them with considerable rigor."

We present Rebound, a general-purpose security framework that preserves rollback protection while enabling policy-authorized legitimate rollbacks of application binaries, configuration, and data. Key to Rebound is a reference monitor that mediates state transitions, enforces authorization policy, guarantees atomicity of state updates and rollbacks, and emits a tamper-evident log that provides transparency to applications and auditors. We formally prove Rebound's security properties and show through an application case study -- with software deployment workflows in GitLab CI -- that it enables robust control over binary, configuration, and raw data versioning with low end-to-end overhead."

Here, we demonstrate ultrafast propagation of magnon-polaritons-hybrid quasiparticles arising from the coupling between spin waves and electromagnetic fields in thin pure, bismuth-, and gallium substituted yttrium iron garnet (YIG, Bi:YIG and Ga:YIG) films. Using time- and phase-resolved Brillouin light scattering microscopy and time-resolved scanning transmission microscopy, we show that magnon-polaritons can propagate faster than 100 km/s, nearly three orders of magnitude more than conventional spin waves, and can be observed at distances exceeding 40 micrometers in 20 nm thick films. Analytical modeling based on retarded Maxwell equations and Polder tensor formalism confirms the hybridized nature of the excitations and captures the nontrivial dispersion and attenuation profiles. Notably, the magnon-polaritons maintain high initial magnetization amplitudes and long decay lengths, enabling ultrafast manipulation of the magnetization far away from the excitation source. We show, that they can move domain walls or stabilize nonlinear magnetization processes. The unprecedentedly high propagation velocities make magnon-polaritons promising candidates for high-speed information transfer in future spin-based computing architectures, potentially overcoming long-standing group delay bottlenecks in magnonic logic circuits."

To accommodate for this, we propose the STRIDE method, which improves on previous external-sensor-based EMI removal methods by exploiting inherent MR image smoothness in its total variation. STRIDE measures data from both EMI detectors and primary MR imaging coils, transforms this data into the image domain, and for each column of the resulting image array, combines and subtracts data from the EMI detectors in a way that optimizes for total-variation smoothness. Performance was tested on phantom and in-vivo datasets with a 0.5T scanner. STRIDE resulted in visually better EMI removal, higher temporal SNR, larger EMI removal percentage, and lower RMSE than standard implementations. STRIDE is a robust technique that leverages inherent MR image properties to provide improved EMI removal performance over standard algorithms, particularly for time-varying noise sources."

This study addresses the decision-making problem faced by a battery energy storage system, which must determine optimal charging and discharging times based on day-ahead electricity price forecasts. To explore the relationship between forecast accuracy and economic value, we generate a pool of 192 forecasts. These are evaluated using seven statistical metrics that go beyond RMSE and MAE, capturing various characteristics of the predictions and associated errors. We calculate the dynamic correlation between the statistical measures and gained profits to reveal that both RMSE and MAE are only weakly correlated with revenue. In contrast, measures that assess the alignment between predicted and actual daily price curves have a stronger relationship with profitability and are thus more effective for selecting optimal forecasts."

    "abstract": "Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) task aims at improving contrast while restoring details and textures for images captured in low-light conditions. HVI color space has made significant progress in this task by enabling precise decoupling of chrominance and luminance. However, for the interaction of chrominance and luminance branches, substantial distributional differences between the two branches prevalent in natural images limit complementary feature extraction, and luminance errors are propagated to chrominance channels through the nonlinear parameter. Furthermore, for interaction between different chrominance branches, images with large homogeneous-color regions usually exhibit weak correlation between chrominance branches due to concentrated distributions. Traditional pixel-wise losses exploit strong inter-branch correlations for co-optimization, causing gradient conflicts in weakly correlated regions. Therefore, we propose an Inter-Chrominance and Luminance Interaction (ICLR) framework including a Dual-stream Interaction Enhancement Module (DIEM) and a Covariance Correction Loss (CCL). The DIEM improves the extraction of complementary information from two dimensions, fusion and enhancement, respectively. The CCL utilizes luminance residual statistics to penalize chrominance errors and balances gradient conflicts by constraining chrominance branches covariance. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that the proposed ICLR framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods."

However, the production of quantum light across multiple frequency combs remains unexplored. In this work, we theoretically explore a mechanism that generates a series of nonlinearly coupled frequency combs through cascaded three-wave upconversion and downconversion processes mediated by a single idler comb. We show how this system generates inter- and intracomb two-mode squeezing and entanglement spanning a very large spectral range, from ultraviolet to mid-IR frequencies.

The analysis shows that using a logic paradigm is an efficient way to attack complex graph problems."

    "abstract": "Text-to-SQL datasets are essential for training and evaluating text-to-SQL models, but existing datasets often suffer from limited coverage and fail to capture the diversity of real-world applications. To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy for text-to-SQL classification based on dimensions including core intents, statement types, syntax structures, and key actions. Using this taxonomy, we evaluate widely used public text-to-SQL datasets (e.g., Spider and Bird) and reveal limitations in their coverage and diversity. We then introduce a taxonomy-guided dataset synthesis pipeline, yielding a new dataset named SQL-Synth. This approach combines the taxonomy with Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure the dataset reflects the breadth and complexity of real-world text-to-SQL applications. Extensive analysis and experimental results validate the effectiveness of our taxonomy, as SQL-Synth exhibits greater diversity and coverage compared to existing benchmarks. Moreover, we uncover that existing LLMs typically fall short in adequately capturing the full range of scenarios, resulting in limited performance on SQL-Synth. However, fine-tuning can substantially improve their performance in these scenarios. The proposed taxonomy has significant potential impact, as it not only enables comprehensive analysis of datasets and the performance of different LLMs, but also guides the construction of training data for LLMs."

    "abstract": "Visual autoregressive (AR) generation models have demonstrated strong potential for image generation, yet their next-token-prediction paradigm introduces considerable inference latency. Although speculative decoding (SD) has been proven effective for accelerating visual AR models, its \"draft one step, then verify one step\" paradigm prevents a direct reduction of the forward passes, thus restricting acceleration potential. Motivated by the visual token interchangeability, we for the first time to explore verification skipping in the SD process of visual AR model generation to explicitly cut the number of target model forward passes, thereby reducing inference latency. Based on an analysis of the drafting stage's characteristics, we observe that verification redundancy and stale feature reusability are key factors to retain generation quality and speedup for verification-free steps. Inspired by these two observations, we propose a novel SD framework VVS to accelerate visual AR generation via partial verification skipping, which integrates three complementary modules: (1) a verification-free token selector with dynamical truncation, (2) token-level feature caching and reuse, and (3) fine-grained skipped step scheduling. Consequently, VVS reduces the number of target model forward passes by a factor of $2.8\\times$ relative to vanilla AR decoding while maintaining competitive generation quality, offering a superior speed-quality trade-off over conventional SD frameworks and revealing strong potential to reshape the SD paradigm."

We start with establishing a general link between the density of resonances and the distribution of the reflection coefficient $r=|R(E,L)|^2$, where $R(E,L)$ is the reflection amplitude, at {\\it complex} energies $E = {\\cal E} +iη$, identifying the parameter $η>0$ with the uniform rate of absorption within the disordered medium. We show that leveraging this link allows for a detailed analysis of the resonance density in the weak disorder limit. In particular, for a (semi)infinite sample, it yields an explicit formula for $ρ({\\cal E},Γ)$, describing the crossover from narrow to broad resonances in a unified way. Similarly, our approach yields a limiting formula for $ρ({\\cal E},Γ)$ in the opposite case of a short disordered sample, with size much smaller than the localization length. This regime seems to have not been systematically addressed in the literature before, with the corresponding analysis requiring an accurate and rather non-trivial implementation of WKB-like asymptotics in the scattering problem. Finally, we study the resonance statistics numerically for the one-dimensional Anderson tight-binding model and compare the results with our analytic expressions."

These decompositions enable a direct and efficient mapping of the Potts model dynamics into hardware-efficient qudit gate sequences for trapped-ion platform. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of a Suzuki-Trotter approximation with our evolution-into-gates framework, for detecting the dynamical quantum phase transition. Our results establish a pathway toward qudit-based digital quantum simulation of many-body models and provide a new perspective on probing nonanalytic behavior in high-dimensional quantum many-body models."

In flat space, the approach reproduces the known relaxation behaviour for massive fields and reveals qualitatively distinct dynamics in the massless case. In de Sitter space, we find that the late-time decay of quench-induced corrections depends sensitively on the mass and may influence the behaviour of cosmological observables such as the power spectrum. The framework also extends straightforwardly to non-Gaussian initial states, providing a basis for future studies of loop effects and primordial non-Gaussianities."

In this method, we introduce the ``maximal SO(3) gauge'' by minimizing the SU(3)/SO(3) part of the SU(3) gauge variable. In the Monte Carlo calculation, the SO(3) real algebra method employs the SO(3) fermionic determinant, i.e., the fermionic determinant of the SO(3) part of the SU(3) gauge variable, in the maximal SO(3) gauge, as well as the positive SU(3) gauge action factor $e^{-S_G}$. Here, the SO(3) fermionic determinant is real, and it is non-negative for the even-number flavor case ($N_f=2n$) of the same quark mass, e.g., $m_u=m_d$. The SO(3) real algebra method alternates between the maximal SO(3) gauge fixing and Monte Carlo updates on the SO(3) determinant and $e^{-S_G}$. After the most importance sampling, the ratio of the SU(3) and SO(3) fermionic determinants is treated as a weight factor. If the phase factor of the ratio does not fluctuate significantly in the sampled gauge configurations, then lattice QCD calculations at finite densities would be feasible."

The massive Chern-Simons field also obeys the equations of motion of a massive vector in AdS3. The lowest energy single particle excitation of this field is dual to the primary operator of conformal dimensions M + 1 with spin one in the dual CFT, all other single particle excitations are dual to its global descendants. We compare the result for the entanglement entropy from the Faulkner-Lewkowycz-Maldacena formula to the single interval entanglement entropy in large charge holographic CFT obtained using the replica trick for the primary and its tower of holomorphic descendants. The two results agree precisely in the leading and sub-leading terms of the short interval expansion.

Next, a generalised hyperbolic controller form with different variants is proposed and a new flatnesss-based scheme to compute said form is presented. Therein, the system is treated in an algebraic setting where generalised polynomials with real exponents are used to describe the predictions and delays in the system. The proposed algorithm is then applied to the motivating example."

In this work, we explore the sensitivity of current and future double beta decay experiments to a massive Majoron-like scalar particle coupled to neutrinos and potentially dark sector fermions, and compare their reach to the relevant cosmological constraints. On- and off-shell production of such scalar particles leads to characteristic distortions in the double beta decay electron spectrum.

However, most existing methods assume full access to the original training dataset, which is often impractical. We address a more realistic yet challenging setting: few-shot zero-glance, where only a small subset of the retained data is available and the forget set is entirely inaccessible. We introduce GFOES, a novel framework comprising a Generative Feedback Network (GFN) and a two-phase fine-tuning procedure. GFN synthesises Optimal Erasure Samples (OES), which induce high loss on target classes, enabling the model to forget class-specific knowledge without access to the original forget data, while preserving performance on retained classes. The two-phase fine-tuning procedure enables aggressive forgetting in the first phase, followed by utility restoration in the second. Experiments on three image classification datasets demonstrate that GFOES achieves effective forgetting at both logit and representation levels, while maintaining strong performance using only 5% of the original data. Our framework offers a practical and scalable solution for privacy-preserving machine learning under data-constrained conditions."

In this work, we propose two protocols to improve the accuracy of QEM for probability distributions, inspired by techniques in software engineering. The first is the N-version programming method, which compares probability distributions obtained via different QEM strategies and excludes the outlier distribution, certifying the feasibility of the error-mitigated distributions. The second is a consistency-based method for selecting an appropriate extrapolation strategy. Specifically, we prepare $K$ data points at different error rates, choose $L<K$ of them for extrapolation, and evaluate error-mitigated results for all $\\binom{K}{L}$ possible choices. We then select the extrapolation method that yields the smallest variance in the error-mitigated results. This procedure can also be applied bitstring-wise, enabling adaptive error mitigation for each probability in the distribution."

Coupling to photonic crystal cavities (PCCs) promises to further enhance the SnV light-matter interface and unlock a diverse range of entanglement generation protocols. Recent pioneering experiments showing Purcell enhancement of SnV centers in PCCs underscore this potential. However, optical coupling that is coherent - the key ingredient for use in quantum protocols - has so far remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate above-unity coherent cooperativity of SnV centers embedded in photonic crystal cavities. We fabricate free-standing PCCs using a quasi-isotropic undercut. Across two samples, we conduct room-temperature characterizations, measuring resonances for 327 cavities, with an average quality factor exceeding $Q = 1.0(3) \\times 10^4$. Two cavity-coupled emitters are examined in detail, exhibiting quality factors up to $Q = 25.4(4) \\times 10^3$ and Purcell-reduced lifetimes corresponding to cooperativities up to $C = 20.6(11)$. Furthermore, the single SnVs are observed to strongly modulate the cavity transmission with an extinction contrast up to $98.8(4) \\%$ on resonance. Finally, SnV linewidth measurements reveal above-unity coherent cooperativities in both devices, with the highest value being $C_\\mathrm{coh} = 8.3(12)$. These results open the door to using cavity-coupled SnV centers as efficient, coherent light-matter interfaces for future quantum networks."

As an illustrative example, we consider nonlinear dynamics governed by the one-dimensional Burgers' equation, which has broad applications in computational fluid dynamics. In particular, we show that the proposed non-unitary quantum circuits can efficiently represent fluid flow configurations in both laminar and turbulent regimes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, when noise is taken into account, these circuits are advantageous in regimes where two-qubit gate error rates are relatively low compared to idling error rates."

It offers new means of studying the behaviour of complex physical systems, for which conventionally software-intensive simulation codes based on numerical high-performance computing are used. Instead, quantum simulations map properties and characteristics of subject systems, for instance chemical molecules, onto quantum devices that then mimic the system under study. Currently, the use of these techniques is largely limited to fundamental science, as the overall approach remains tailored for specific problems: We lack infrastructure and modelling abstractions that are provided by the software engineering community for other computational domains. In this paper, we identify critical gaps in the quantum simulation software stack-particularly the absence of general-purpose frameworks for model specification, Hamiltonian construction, and hardware-aware mappings. We advocate for a modular model-driven engineering (MDE) approach that supports different types of quantum simulation (digital and analogue), and facilitates automation, performance evaluation, and reusability. Through an example from high-energy physics, we outline a vision for a quantum simulation framework capable of supporting scalable, cross-platform simulation workflows."

Existing methods are typically optimized to capture features within the in-distribution (ID) data and calculate OOD scores, which often limits pre-trained models from representing distributional boundaries, leading to unreliable OOD detection. Moreover, the latent structure of graph data is often governed by multiple underlying factors, which remains less explored. To address these challenges, we propose a novel test-time graph OOD detection method, termed BaCa, that calibrates OOD scores using dual dynamically updated dictionaries without requiring fine-tuning the pre-trained model. Specifically, BaCa estimates graphons and applies a mix-up strategy solely with test samples to generate diverse boundary-aware discriminative topologies, eliminating the need for exposing auxiliary datasets as outliers. We construct dual dynamic dictionaries via priority queues and attention mechanisms to adaptively capture latent ID and OOD representations, which are then utilized for boundary-aware OOD score calibration. To the best of our knowledge, extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that BaCa significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in OOD detection."

    "abstract": "We prove a refinement of Quillen's Theorem A, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for a functor to be cofinal with respect to diagrams valued in a fixed $\\infty$-category. We deduce this from a general duality phenomenon for weighted colimits, which is of independent interest. As a sample application, due to Betts and Dan-Cohen, we describe a simplified formula for the free $\\mathbb{E}_\\infty$-algebra on an $\\mathbb{E}_0$-algebra in a stable rational $\\infty$-category ."

    "abstract": "Patch-wise multi-label classification provides an efficient alternative to full pixel-wise segmentation on high-resolution images, particularly when the objective is to determine the presence or absence of target objects within a patch rather than their precise spatial extent. This formulation substantially reduces annotation cost, simplifies training, and allows flexible patch sizing aligned with the desired level of decision granularity. In this work, we focus on a special case, patch-wise binary classification, applied to the detection of a single class of interest (tumor) on high-resolution multimodal nonlinear microscopy images. We show that, although this simplified formulation enables efficient model development, it can introduce spurious correlations between patch composition and labels: tumor patches tend to contain larger tissue regions, whereas non-tumor patches often consist mostly of background with small tissue areas. We further quantify the bias in model predictions caused by this spurious correlation, and propose to use a debiasing strategy to mitigate its effect. Specifically, we apply GERNE, a debiasing method that can be adapted to maximize worst-group accuracy (WGA). Our results show an improvement in WGA by approximately 7% compared to ERM for two different thresholds used to binarize the spurious feature. This enhancement boosts model performance on critical minority cases, such as tumor patches with small tissues and non-tumor patches with large tissues, and underscores the importance of spurious correlation-aware learning in patch-wise classification problems."

    "abstract": "Accurate uncertainty quantification is a critical challenge in machine learning. While neural networks are highly versatile and capable of learning complex patterns, they often lack interpretability due to their ``black box'' nature. On the other hand, probabilistic ``white box'' models, though interpretable, often suffer from a significant performance gap when compared to neural networks. To address this, we propose a novel quantum physics-based ``white box'' method that offers both accurate uncertainty quantification and enhanced interpretability. By mapping the kernel mean embedding (KME) of a time series data vector to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), we construct a tensor network-inspired 1D spin chain Hamiltonian, with the KME as one of its eigen-functions or eigen-modes. We then solve the associated Schr{ö}dinger equation and apply perturbation theory to quantify uncertainty, thereby improving the interpretability of tasks performed with the quantum tensor network-based model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology, compared to state-of-the-art ``white box\" models, in change point detection and time series clustering, providing insights into the uncertainties associated with decision-making throughout the process."

    "abstract": "We consider a random walk on a homogeneous space $G/Λ$ where $G$ is a non-compact simple Lie group and $Λ$ is a lattice. The walk is driven by a probability measure $μ$ on $G$ whose support generates a Zariski-dense subgroup. We show that the random walk equidistributes toward the Haar measure unless it is trapped in a finite $μ$-invariant set. Moreover, under arithmetic assumptions on the pair $(Λ, μ)$, we show the convergence occurs at an exponential rate, tempered by the obstructions that the starting point may be high in a cusp or close to a finite orbit. The main challenge is to show that the dimensional properties of a given probability distribution on $G/Λ$ improve under convolution by $μ$. For this, we develop a new method, which combines a dimensional stability result and a dimensional increase alternative. This approach allows us to bypass inherent geometric obstructions. To show dimensional stability, we establish a general subcritical projection theorem under optimal non-concentration assumptions on the projector, and a corresponding submodular inequality in simple Lie algebras which allows its application to random walks. Both are of independent interest. The dimensional increase alternative aligns with the spirit of Bourgain's projection theorem. It is fine-tuned for random walks and has the advantage of being valid in situations lacking transversality."

    "abstract": "Public Narratives (PNs) are key tools for leadership development and civic mobilization, yet their systematic analysis remains challenging due to their subjective interpretation and the high cost of expert annotation. In this work, we propose a novel computational framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate the qualitative annotation of public narratives. Using a codebook we co-developed with subject-matter experts, we evaluate LLM performance against that of expert annotators. Our work reveals that LLMs can achieve near-human-expert performance, achieving an average F1 score of 0.80 across 8 narratives and 14 codes. We then extend our analysis to empirically explore how PN framework elements manifest across a larger dataset of 22 stories. Lastly, we extrapolate our analysis to a set of political speeches, establishing a novel lens in which to analyze political rhetoric in civic spaces. This study demonstrates the potential of LLM-assisted annotation for scalable narrative analysis and highlights key limitations and directions for future research in computational civic storytelling."

    "abstract": "This study presents a systematic evaluation of time-frequency feature design for binaural sound source localization (SSL), focusing on how feature selection influences model performance across diverse conditions. We investigate the performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using various combinations of amplitude-based features (magnitude spectrogram, interaural level difference - ILD) and phase-based features (phase spectrogram, interaural phase difference - IPD). Evaluations on in-domain and out-of-domain data with mismatched head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) reveal that carefully chosen feature combinations often outperform increases in model complexity. While two-feature sets such as ILD + IPD are sufficient for in-domain SSL, generalization to diverse content requires richer inputs combining channel spectrograms with both ILD and IPD. Using the optimal feature sets, our low-complexity CNN model achieves competitive performance. Our findings underscore the importance of feature design in binaural SSL and provide practical guidance for both domain-specific and general-purpose localization."

    "abstract": "Conservation of symmetries plays a crucial role in both classical and quantum simulations of many-body systems, enabling the tracking of states with specific symmetry properties and leading to substantial reductions in the number of optimization parameters. The design of efficient quantum circuits that enforce all symmetries typically encountered in chemistry has remained elusive, mainly due to the interplay of point group and spin symmetries. By exploiting Lie algebraic techniques, we derive exact product formulas representing symmetry-adapted unitaries. These decompositions allow us to design the most efficient symmetry-preserving quantum circuits to date. Finally, we introduce a minimum universal symmetry-adapted operator pool to further reduce the required quantum resources."

    "abstract": "Flow networks are fundamental for understanding systems such as animal and plant vasculature or power distribution grids. These networks can encode, transmit, and transform information embodied in the spatial and temporal distribution of their flows. In this work, we focus on a minimal yet physically grounded system that allows us to isolate the fundamental mechanisms by which active flow networks generate and regulate emergent dynamics capable of supporting information transmission. The system is composed of active units that pump fluid and elastic units that store volume. From first principles, we derive a discrete model-an active flow network-that enables the simulation of large systems with many interacting units. Numerically, we show that the pressure field can develop solitary waves, resulting in the spontaneous creation and transmission of localized packets of information stored in the physical properties of the flow. We characterize how these solitary waves emerge from disordered initial conditions in a one-dimensional network, and how their size and propagation speed depend on key system parameters. Finally, when the elastic units are coupled to their neighbors, the solitary waves exhibit even richer dynamics, with diverse shapes and finite lifetimes that display power-law behaviors that we can predict analytically. Together, these results show how simple fluidic elements can collectively create, shape and transport information, laying the foundations for understanding-and ultimately engineering-information processing in active flow systems."

This study introduces a high-resolution, hierarchical modeling framework that provides detailed insights from the solar cell to the system level. Rigorously validated against field-test data from calibrated equipment, the model demonstrates high accuracy in predicting minute-wised dynamic electrical characteristics (R2 > 0.90). A key finding is the critical shortcoming of conventional, coarser-resolution models under realistic shading; these are shown to overestimate the actual string operating power by up to 163% and the monthly energy yield by up to 54%. The proposed framework avoids these errors by precisely capturing mismatch losses and the time-varying phenomena of system components, such as bypass diode activations. Furthermore, the model accurately quantifies the effectiveness of mitigation technologies, showing that Module-Level Power Electronics (MLPEs) can increase the monthly energy yield of a heavily shaded string by over 20%. This research provides a crucial tool for reliable system design, accurate power forecasting, and the optimization of PV systems in complex urban settings."

    "abstract": "Accurate delineation of agricultural field boundaries from satellite imagery is essential for land management and crop monitoring, yet existing methods often produce incomplete boundaries, merge adjacent fields, and struggle to scale. We present the Delineate Anything Flow (DelAnyFlow) methodology, a resolution-agnostic approach for large-scale field boundary mapping. DelAnyFlow combines the DelAny instance segmentation model, based on a YOLOv11 backbone and trained on the large-scale Field Boundary Instance Segmentation-22M (FBIS 22M) dataset, with a structured post-processing, merging, and vectorization sequence to generate topologically consistent vector boundaries. FBIS 22M, the largest dataset of its kind, contains 672,909 multi-resolution image patches (0.25-10m) and 22.9million validated field instances. The DelAny model delivers state-of-the-art accuracy with over 100% higher mAP and 400x faster inference than SAM2. DelAny demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization and supports national-scale applications: using Sentinel 2 data for 2024, DelAnyFlow generated a complete field boundary layer for Ukraine (603,000km2) in under six hours on a single workstation. DelAnyFlow outputs significantly improve boundary completeness relative to operational products from Sinergise Solutions and NASA Harvest, particularly in smallholder and fragmented systems (0.25-1ha). For Ukraine, DelAnyFlow delineated 3.75M fields at 5m and 5.15M at 2.5m, compared to 2.66M detected by Sinergise Solutions and 1.69M by NASA Harvest. This work delivers a scalable, cost-effective methodology for field delineation in regions lacking digital cadastral data.

The synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments confirm the superconducting transition originates from a structure transition to the P6/mmm phase under high pressure, suggesting the observation of graphene-like phosphorus layers in transition metal phosphides. By first-principles calculations, we provide more evidence for the stability of the graphene-like phosphorus layers in LaP2. Our findings are helpful for the understanding of the LaP2 phase diagram under high pressure, and could shed light on the research of unique structures in transition metal phosphides under high pressure."

    "abstract": "Scene Text Editing (STE) aims to naturally modify text in images while preserving visual consistency, the decisive factors of which can be divided into three parts, i.e., text style, text content, and background. Previous methods have struggled with incomplete disentanglement of editable attributes, typically addressing only one aspect - such as editing text content - thus limiting controllability and visual consistency. To overcome these limitations, we propose TripleFDS, a novel framework for STE with disentangled modular attributes, and an accompanying dataset called SCB Synthesis. SCB Synthesis provides robust training data for triple feature disentanglement by utilizing the \"SCB Group\", a novel construct that combines three attributes per image to generate diverse, disentangled training groups. Leveraging this construct as a basic training unit, TripleFDS first disentangles triple features, ensuring semantic accuracy through inter-group contrastive regularization and reducing redundancy through intra-sample multi-feature orthogonality. In the synthesis phase, TripleFDS performs feature remapping to prevent \"shortcut\" phenomena during reconstruction and mitigate potential feature leakage. Trained on 125,000 SCB Groups, TripleFDS achieves state-of-the-art image fidelity (SSIM of 44.54) and text accuracy (ACC of 93.58%) on the mainstream STE benchmarks. Besides superior performance, the more flexible editing of TripleFDS supports new operations such as style replacement and background transfer. Code: https://github.com/yusenbao01/TripleFDS"

We propose a new method for differentiable simulators that delivers accurate posterior inference with substantially reduced runtimes. Building on the Optimization Monte Carlo framework, our approach reformulates stochastic simulation as deterministic optimization problems. Gradient-based methods are then applied to efficiently navigate toward high-density posterior regions and avoid wasteful simulations in low-probability areas. A JAX-based implementation further enhances the performance through vectorization of key method components. Extensive experiments, including high-dimensional parameter spaces, uninformative outputs, multiple observations and multimodal posteriors show that our method consistently matches, and often exceeds, the accuracy of state-of-the-art approaches, while reducing the runtime by a substantial margin."

The pixels serve as a unit cell of an active pixel sensor to achieve a high level of parallelization and fast readout. These properties are exploited in the DANAE experiment, which aims for the direct detection of light dark matter based with the event signature of electron recoils. We present the experimental characterization of an $64\\times64$ RNDR-DEPFET pixel detector with a focus on the charge carrier generation rate. This technology achieves a high time resolution, which increases its sensitivity on rare events with a signal of two or more electrons due to the Poisson distribution of thermal generated electrons."

This is first and unique end-to-end solution that eliminates routine and resource-intensive problems of processing, creating and visualizing both of explicit and implicit dependencies for prominent SQL dialects on-the-fly. Once launched, FLOWER automatically detects built-in constraints and starting to create own correct and necessary one using dynamic sampling and robust data analysis techniques. This approach applies to improve entity-relationship model and data storytelling to better understand the foundation of data and get unseen insights from DB sources using SQL or natural language.

To overcome this challenge, we investigate a beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) aided multi-cell multi-user downlink MIMO communication system, where a BD-RIS is deployed to enhance desired signals and suppress both intra-cell and inter-cell interference.We formulate the joint optimization problem of the transmit beamforming matrices at the BSs and the BD-RIS reflection matrix to maximize the weighted sum rate of all users, subject to the challenging unitary constraint of the BD-RIS reflection matrix and transmit power constraints at the BSs. To tackle this non-convex and difficult problem, we apply the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) method to transform the problem into an equivalent tractable form, and propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm to iteratively update the transmit beamforming and BD-RIS reflection using Lagrange duality theory and manifold optimization. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed design over various benchmark schemes, and provide useful practical insights on the BD-RIS deployment strategy for multi-cell systems."

    "abstract": "This study examines the onset of rotating magnetoconvection under an axially imposed magnetic field in the presence of partial thermal stable stratification. Three stratification models-fully unstable, weakly stable, and strongly stable-are analyzed across Ekman numbers $E = 10^{-3}, 10^{-4}$, and $10^{-5}$ (rotation rates) and Roberts numbers $q = 0.01, 1$ and $10$ (diffusivity ratios). Magnetic back-reaction is explored by varying the Elsasser number ($Λ$) from 0 to 10. Symmetry-breaking effects of stable layer are assessed via an asymmetry index. Additionally, local scaling laws are derived for onset parameters and convective penetration is quantified numerically. Results show that stable stratification promotes earlier onset and smaller-scale flows, with stronger effects in weak field regimes-hallmarks of penetrative convection. In weak magnetic fields, symmetry breaking is pronounced but weakens for strong field regime. Convective roll thickening peaks at $Λ= 1$, while columnarity persists in both weak and strong field regimes due to rotational constraints and elongation effects along imposed field direction, respectively. Magnetic stabilization is most effective at low to moderate values of $q$ but weakens in high $q$ regimes. Penetration depth is inversely related to the magnetic field strength and rotation rates, particularly under strong stratification, but varies non-monotonically with rotation in weakly stratified cases. In the non-magnetic limit, the critical Ekman number $E_c$, exhibiting maximum penetration effects, is obtained as $E_c = 10^{-4}$ for weak stable stratification and $E_c = 10^{-3}$ for strong stable stratification. Obtained results can provide insights into the complex interplay of various geophysical effects on planetary interiors."

    "abstract": "Rock discontinuities critically govern the mechanical behavior and stability of rock masses. Their internal distributions remain largely unobservable and are typically inferred from surface-exposed discontinuities using generative prediction approaches. However, surface-exposed observations are inherently sparse, and existing generative prediction approaches either fail to capture the underlying complex distribution patterns or lack robustness under data-sparse conditions. Here, we proposed a simple yet robust approach for statistically accurate generative prediction of rock discontinuities by utilizing a tabular foundation model. By leveraging the powerful sample learning capability of the foundation model specifically designed for small data, our approach can effectively capture the underlying complex distribution patterns within limited measured discontinuities. Comparative experiments on ten datasets with diverse scales and distribution patterns of discontinuities demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness over conventional statistical models and deep generative approaches. This work advances quantitative characterization of rock mass structures, supporting safer and more reliable data-driven geotechnical design."

Three stratification models-fully unstable, weakly stable, and strongly stable-are considered to examine their influence on convective onset. A broad range of rotation rates and diffusivity ratios captures the effects of rotation and thermal-to-magnetic diffusivity contrast, while magnetic back-reaction is analyzed by varying the imposed magnetic field strength. To assess the impact of stratification on convection threshold and flow structure, we derive local scaling laws for critical onset parameters and compute penetration percentages to quantify convective intrusion into the stable layer. Results show that stable stratification promotes earlier onset and smaller-scale flows, with stronger effects in rotation-dominated regimes-hallmarks of penetrative convection. In weak magnetic fields, faster rotation enhances columnarity and intensifies stratification effects while delaying onset. Under strong magnetic fields, thicker rolls persist even at rapid rotation, with limited but noticeable penetration into the stable layer. Magnetic stabilization is more effective at low to moderate diffusivity ratios but weakens at high diffusivity ratio. Penetration decreases with stronger magnetic fields and rotation, especially under strong stratification, but varies non-monotonically with rotation in weak stratification and magnetic regimes. These findings highlight the complex interplay among stratification, rotation, and magnetic field strength in setting the onset and structure of rotating convection relevant to planetary interiors."

The spectral energy distribution (SED) and its temporal evolution are consistent with a mix of non-thermal and thermal components.

While commercial perfusion analysis software exists, it is often costly, closed source, and lacks customizability.

PyPeT is capable of producing cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), time-to-peak (TTP), and time-to-maximum (Tmax) maps from raw four-dimensional perfusion data. PyPeT aims to make perfusion research as accessible and customizable as possible. This is achieved through a unified framework in which both CTP and MRP data can be processed, with a strong focus on modularity, low computational burden, and significant inline documentation. PyPeT's outputs can be validated through an extensive debug mode in which every step of the process is visualized. Additional validation was performed via visual and quantitative comparison with reference perfusion maps generated by three FDA-approved commercial perfusion tools and a research tool. These comparisons show a mean SSIM around 0.8 for all comparisons, indicating a good and stable correlation with FDA-approved tools.

Although recent methods for 3D LiDAR point cloud generation have shown significant improvements, they still face notable limitations, including the lack of sequential generation capabilities and the inability to produce accurately positioned foreground objects and realistic backgrounds. These shortcomings hinder their practical applicability. In this paper, we introduce DriveLiDAR4D, a novel LiDAR generation pipeline consisting of multimodal conditions and a novel sequential noise prediction model LiDAR4DNet, capable of producing temporally consistent LiDAR scenes with highly controllable foreground objects and realistic backgrounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address the sequential generation of LiDAR scenes with full scene manipulation capability in an end-to-end manner. We evaluated DriveLiDAR4D on the nuScenes and KITTI datasets, where we achieved an FRD score of 743.13 and an FVD score of 16.96 on the nuScenes dataset, surpassing the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, UniScene, with an performance boost of 37.2% in FRD and 24.1% in FVD, respectively."

    "abstract": "Although a growing number of exoskeletons have been developed for occupational applications, wrist exoskeletons remain relatively rare. However, in the meat processing industry, elbow and hand-wrist musculoskeletal disorders are particularly common. The aim of this study was to assess the potential effectiveness and risks of a 670g wrist exoskeleton prototype designed to assist operators during meat cutting tasks. Six professional butchers performed three standardized tasks reproducing meat cutting gestures in foam, in three randomized experimental conditions: (1) without exoskeleton, (2) wearing the exoskeleton passive, with brakes off and (3) using it with brakes activated, locked in a static position. Cutting forces were recorded using an instrumented table, joint angles using an optoelectronic motion capture system, muscle activity using surface EMG and user experience was assessed using questionnaires. The cutting inaccuracy was defined as the area between the prescribed task and the actual cut on the foam surface. Joint torques were estimated by inverse dynamics with and without taking the exoskeleton's mass into account, to isolate its effect. Linear mixed-effects statistical models were fitted. With the exoskeleton active during tasks, EMG activity was decreased of up to 18.7% (p<0.01 to p<0.001) in the wrist flexors and increased of up to 61.7% (not significant to p<0.05) in the upper trapezius. Shoulder elevation joint torques were increased of up to 39.7% (p<0.001), mainly due to the exoskeleton mass. The proposed multi-criteria exoskeleton evaluation has provided guidance for following prototyping stages. Too heavy wrist exoskeletons could increase the risk of shoulder tendinitis for such tasks."

The key innovation is the incorporation of causal effect estimation for identifying stable biomarkers, coupled with a GNN-based propensity scoring mechanism that leverages cross-gene regulatory networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves consistently high predictive accuracy across four distinct datasets and four independent classifiers. Moreover, it enables the identification of more stable biomarkers compared to traditional methods.

Bolstered by growing reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path to enhance healthcare predictions by drawing on their rich parametric knowledge. However, LLMs are prone to factual inaccuracies due to limitations in the reliability and coverage of their embedded knowledge. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks, such as GraphRAG and its variants, have been proposed to mitigate these issues by incorporating external knowledge, they face two key challenges in the healthcare scenario: (1) identifying the clinical necessity to activate the retrieval mechanism, and (2) achieving synergy between the retriever and the generator to craft contextually appropriate retrievals. To address these challenges, we propose GHAR, a \\underline{g}enerative \\underline{h}ierarchical \\underline{a}gentic \\underline{R}AG framework that simultaneously resolves when to retrieve and how to optimize the collaboration between submodules in healthcare. Specifically, for the first challenge, we design a dual-agent architecture comprising Agent-Top and Agent-Low. Agent-Top acts as the primary physician, iteratively deciding whether to rely on parametric knowledge or to initiate retrieval, while Agent-Low acts as the consulting service, summarising all task-relevant knowledge once retrieval was triggered. To tackle the second challenge, we innovatively unify the optimization of both agents within a formal Markov Decision Process, designing diverse rewards to align their shared goal of accurate prediction while preserving their distinct roles. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets across three popular tasks demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the potential of hierarchical agentic RAG in advancing healthcare systems."

Existing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) approaches often overlook these characteristics, resulting in uninformative and redundant visual representations.

We first propose progressive question conditioning, which injects the question into Vision Transformer layers with gradually increasing frequency, considering each layer's capacity to handle additional information, to generate question-aware visual features. To reduce redundancy, we introduce a pruning strategy that discards background tokens, thereby improving efficiency. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we further propose token focusing, a training strategy that encourages the model to concentrate essential information in the retained tokens. By combining these approaches, we present TabFlash, an efficient and effective MLLM for table understanding. TabFlash achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary MLLMs, while requiring 27% less FLOPs and 30% less memory usage compared to the second-best MLLM."

This model is a stochastic nonlinear dynamical system that encompasses dynamical competition between a (saturating) trending and a mean-reverting component. We find the so-called mispricing distribution and the trend distribution to be unimodal Gaussians in the small noise, small feedback limit. Slow trends yield Gaussian-cosh mispricing distributions that allow for a P-bifurcation: unimodality occurs when mean-reversion is fast, bimodality when it is slow. The critical point of this bifurcation is established and refutes previous ad-hoc reports and differs from the bifurcation condition of the dynamical system itself. For fast, weakly coupled trends, deploying the Furutsu-Novikov theorem reveals that the result is again unimodal Gaussian. For the same case with higher coupling we disprove another claim from the literature: bimodal trend distributions do not generally imply bimodal mispricing distributions. The latter becomes bimodal only for stronger trend feedback. The exact solution in this last regime remains unfortunately beyond our proficiency."

Under a general Ricean fading channel model, a closed-form analytical expression for the average spectral efficiency (SE) achieved by PAs is first derived. Based on this, a sum-SE maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the primary and secondary pinching beamforming, subject to system constraints on the transmission power budgets, minimum antenna separation requirements, and feasible PA deployment regions. To address this non-convex problem, a three-stage optimization algorithm is developed to sequentially optimize both the PT and ST pinching beamforming, and the ST power control. For the PT and ST pinching beamforming optimization, the coarse positions of PA are first determined at the waveguide-level. Then, wavelength-level refinements achieve constructive signal combination at the intended user and destructive superposition at the unintended user. For the ST power control, a closed-form solution is derived. Simulation results demonstrate that i) PAs can achieve significant SE improvements over conventional fixed-position antennas; ii) the proposed pinching beamforming design achieves effective interference suppression and superior performance for both even and odd numbers of PAs; and iii) the developed three-stage optimization algorithm enables nearly orthogonal transmission between the primary and secondary networks."

It incorporates the fermionic Bogoliubov quasiparticles, bosonic Nambu-Goldstone (NG) quantum and thermal phase fluctuations in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions, and topological Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) vortex-antivortex fluctuations on an equal footing, to self-consistently treat the superconducting gap and superfluid density. This unified phase-fluctuating description naturally recovers the previously known limiting results: the superconducting gap in the 2D limit can remain robust against long-wavelength NG phase fluctuations at $T=0^+$ due to Coulomb-induced regularization, while the gradual proliferation of BKT fluctuations as the system approaches criticality drives a separation between the global superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ and the gap-closing temperature $T^*$. In contrast to mean-field theory, which predicts 2D superconductivity to be independent of carrier density and non-magnetic disorder (Anderson theorem), the incorporation of phase fluctuations generates a density- and disorder-dependent zero-point gap $Δ(0)$ and consequently $T_c$ and $T^*$. Remarkably, applications to bilayer MoS$_2$ [Nat. Nanotechnol. 14, 1123 (2019)] and disordered InO$_x$ thin films [Nat.

(4) The 3D representation shows that sources appearing coincident in $(t,T_{\\text{s}}^\\infty)$ occupy distinct $B$-layers, removing degeneracies. VCH can substantially reshape late-time thermal states when spin-down power remains high; its observability depends chiefly on $(B,P_0)$ rather than on mass alone. We provide a practical $(B,P_0)$ validity map for $L_{\\text{h}}=J|\\dotΩ_\\infty|$ and advocate treating $B$ as a co-equal axis in cooling analyses. (Shortened due to the arXiv words limit.)"

    "abstract": "This paper develops and empirically evaluates a Sharpe-driven stock selection and liquidity-constrained portfolio optimization framework designed for the Chinese equity market. The proposed methodology integrates three sequential stages: Sharpe-ratio-based universe selection, liquidity-adjusted mean-variance optimization, and multi-layered risk management implemented within an automated trading bot. Using daily price and volume data from 2023 to 2025 across the A-share universe, the framework dynamically identifies stocks exhibiting strong risk-adjusted performance while accounting for trading frictions and liquidity asymmetries that are common in emerging markets. Empirical backtests reveal that the proposed strategy achieves an annualized return of 25 percent, a Sharpe ratio of 1.71, and a maximum drawdown of 8.2 percent. These results significantly outperform the Buy-and-Hold benchmark, which records an annualized return of 21 percent, a Sharpe ratio of 1.62, and a drawdown of 7.6 percent over the same period. The superior performance demonstrates that incorporating risk-adjusted selection and liquidity-aware constraints enhances both profitability and stability, enabling the portfolio to capture upside potential while maintaining drawdown resilience. Beyond its empirical success, this study contributes methodologically by bridging classical mean-variance theory with practical liquidity adjustments and dynamic Sharpe-based screening. The resulting system not only improves the tradability of optimized portfolios but also provides a scalable and adaptive framework for quantitative asset allocation in liquidity-sensitive markets, offering new evidence that disciplined risk-return optimization can outperform passive investment strategies in the post-2023 Chinese equity landscape."

    "abstract": "The reliance of mobile GUI agents on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) introduces a severe privacy vulnerability: screenshots containing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) are often sent to untrusted, third-party routers. These routers can exploit their own MLLMs to mine this data, violating user privacy. Existing privacy perturbations fail the critical dual challenge of this scenario: protecting PII from the router's MLLM while simultaneously preserving task utility for the agent's MLLM. To address this gap, we propose the Dual-Task Adversarial Protector (DualTAP), a novel framework that, for the first time, explicitly decouples these conflicting objectives. DualTAP trains a lightweight generator using two key innovations: (i) a contrastive attention module that precisely identifies and targets only the PII-sensitive regions, and (ii) a dual-task adversarial objective that simultaneously minimizes a task-preservation loss (to maintain agent utility) and a privacy-interference loss (to suppress PII leakage). To facilitate this study, we introduce PrivScreen, a new dataset of annotated mobile screenshots designed specifically for this dual-task evaluation. Comprehensive experiments on six diverse MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5) demonstrate DualTAP's state-of-the-art protection. It reduces the average privacy leakage rate by 31.6 percentage points (a 3.0x relative improvement) while, critically, maintaining an 80.8% task success rate - a negligible drop from the 83.6% unprotected baseline. DualTAP presents the first viable solution to the privacy-utility trade-off in mobile MLLM agents."

Most predictors of experimental observables are non-differentiable, making them incompatible with gradient-based conditional sampling. This is especially limiting in nuclear magnetic resonance, where rich data such as chemical shifts are hard to directly integrate into generative modeling. We introduce a framework for non-differentiable guidance of protein generative models, coupling a continuous diffusion-based generator with any black-box objective via a tailored genetic algorithm. We demonstrate its effectiveness across three modalities: pairwise distance constraints, nuclear Overhauser effect restraints, and for the first time chemical shifts. These results establish chemical shift guided structure generation as feasible, expose key weaknesses in current predictors, and showcase a general strategy for incorporating diverse experimental signals. Our work points toward automated, data-conditioned protein modeling beyond the limits of differentiability."

    "abstract": "Traditional gradient boosting algorithms employ static tree structures with fixed splitting criteria that remain unchanged throughout training, limiting their ability to adapt to evolving gradient distributions and problem-specific characteristics across different learning stages. This work introduces MorphBoost, a new gradient boosting framework featuring self-organizing tree structures that dynamically morph their splitting behavior during training. The algorithm implements adaptive split functions that evolve based on accumulated gradient statistics and iteration-dependent learning pressures, enabling automatic adjustment to problem complexity. Key innovations include: (1) morphing split criterion combining gradient-based scores with information-theoretic metrics weighted by training progress; (2) automatic problem fingerprinting for intelligent parameter configuration across binary/multiclass/regression tasks; (3) vectorized tree prediction achieving significant computational speedups; (4) interaction-aware feature importance detecting multiplicative relationships; and (5) fast-mode optimization balancing speed and accuracy. Comprehensive benchmarking across 10 diverse datasets against competitive models (XGBoost, LightGBM, GradientBoosting, HistGradientBoosting, ensemble methods) demonstrates that MorphBoost achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming XGBoost by 0.84% on average. MorphBoost secured the overall winner position with 4/10 dataset wins (40% win rate) and 6/30 top-3 finishes (20%), while maintaining the lowest variance (σ=0.0948) and highest minimum accuracy across all models, revealing superior consistency and robustness. Performance analysis across difficulty levels shows competitive results on easy datasets while achieving notable improvements on advanced problems due to higher adaptation levels."

MRIQT combines realistic K-space degradation for physics-consistent uLF simulation, v-prediction with classifier-free guidance for stable image-to-image generation, and an SNR-weighted 3D perceptual loss for anatomical fidelity. The model denoises from a noised uLF input conditioned on the same scan, leveraging volumetric attention-UNet architecture for structure-preserving translation. Trained on a neonatal cohort with diverse pathologies, MRIQT surpasses recent GAN and CNN baselines in PSNR 15.3% with 1.78% over the state of the art, while physicians rated 85% of its outputs as good quality with clear pathology present.

To do this, we synthesise a novel dataset containing 4k+ English words spoken in isolation alongside stylistically consistent spectrogram and waveform figures. We test the ability of VLMs to understand these representations of speech through a multiple-choice task whereby models must predict the correct phonemic or graphemic transcription of a spoken word when presented amongst 3 distractor transcriptions that have been selected based on their phonemic edit distance to the ground truth. We observe that both zero-shot and finetuned models rarely perform above chance, demonstrating the requirement for specific parametric knowledge of how to interpret such figures, rather than paired samples alone."

In the attractive regime, we reveal that weak attractions sustain stable vortex arrays, whereas stronger attractions quench vortices, trigger radial contraction, and culminate in collapse at the Gagliardo-Nirenberg threshold. These findings deliver a cohesive numerical benchmark for vortex formation and collapse dynamics, forging a rigorous link between superfluidity and superconductivity in rotating quantum matter."

    "abstract": "Modeling microstructural evolution at large strains requires mechanical formulations that remain thermodynamically consistent while capturing significant lattice rotations and transformation-induced stresses. However, most existing finite-strain microelasticity and phase-field approaches apply macroscopic boundary conditions heuristically, preventing proper stress relaxation and violating the Hill-Mandel work equivalence required for homogenization. These limitations can misrepresent stress states and transformation pathways under finite strains. Here a variationally consistent finite-strain microelasticity framework is presented that couples microscopic and macroscopic mechanical equilibrium through a single energy functional. The resulting Euler-Lagrange conditions, periodic micro-equilibrium and macroscopic stress balance, are solved using a staggered FFT-Newton algorithm that combines a spectral fixed-point update for local fields with a Newton step for the homogenized deformation gradient. The formulation accommodates general hyperelastic constitutive laws and arbitrary transformation gradients. Benchmarks demonstrate accurate recovery of small-strain Eshelby solutions and systematic nonlinear deviations at large dilatations. Applied to deformation twinning in magnesium, the framework reproduces lenticular morphology, stress redistribution, and faster lateral growth consistent with experiments. This approach establishes a rigorous and scalable foundation for finite-strain phase-field simulations of coherent transformations under general stress or mixed boundary conditions."

    "abstract": "Lattice thermal conductivity ($κ_L$) is a key physical property governing heat transport in solids, with direct relevance to thermoelectrics, thermal barrier coatings, and heat management applications. However, while experimental determination of $κ_L$ is challenging, its theoretical calculation via ab initio methods particularly using density functional theory (DFT) is computationally intensive, often more demanding than electronic transport calculations by an order of magnitude. In this work, we present a machine learning (ML) approach to predict $κ_L$ with DFT-level accuracy over a wide temperature range (100-1000 K). Among various models trained on DFT-calculated data \\textcolor{black}{obtained} from literature, the Extra Trees Regressor (ETR) yielded the best performance on log-scaled $κ_L$, achieving an average $R^2$ of 0.9994 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0466 $W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}$. The ETR model also generalized well to twelve previously unseen (randomly chosen) low and high $κ_L$ compounds with diverse space group symmetries, reaching an $R^2$ of 0.961 against DFT benchmarks. Notably, the model excels in predicting $κ_L$ for both low- and high-symmetry compounds, enabling efficient high-throughput screening. We also demonstrate this capability by screening ultralow and ultrahigh $κ_L$ candidates among 960 half-Heusler \\textcolor{black}{compounds} and 60,000 ICSD compounds from the AFLOW database. This result shows reliability of model developed for screening of potential thermoelectric materials. At the end, we have tested model's prediction ability on systems that have experimental $κ_L$ available that shows model's ability to search material that has desirable experimental $κ_L$ for thermoelectric applications."

Recent DETR-based methods attempt to mitigate this through global attention and auxiliary depth prediction, yet they still struggle with inaccurate depth estimates. Moreover, these methods often overlook instance-level detection difficulty, such as occlusion, distance, and truncation, leading to suboptimal detection performance. We propose MonoDLGD, a novel Difficulty-Aware Label-Guided Denoising framework that adaptively perturbs and reconstructs ground-truth labels based on detection uncertainty. Specifically, MonoDLGD applies stronger perturbations to easier instances and weaker ones into harder cases, and then reconstructs them to effectively provide explicit geometric supervision. By jointly optimizing label reconstruction and 3D object detection, MonoDLGD encourages geometry-aware representation learning and improves robustness to varying levels of object complexity. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that MonoDLGD achieves state-of-the-art performance across all difficulty levels."

    "abstract": "The translation of written language has been known since the 3rd century BC; however, its necessity has become increasingly common in the information age. Today, many translators exist, based on encoder-decoder deep architectures, nevertheless, no quantitative objective methods are available to assess their performance, likely because the entropy of even a single language remains unknown. This study presents a quantitative method for estimating translation entropy, with the following key finding. Given a translator, several sentences that differ by only one selected token of a given pivot sentence yield identical translations. Analyzing the statistics of this phenomenon across an ensemble of such sentences, consisting each of a pivot selected token, yields the probabilities of replacing this specific token with others while preserving the translation. These probabilities constitute the entropy of the selected token, and the average across all selected pivot tokens provides an estimate of the translator's overall translation entropy, which is enhanced along the decoder blocks. This entropic measure allows for the quantitative ranking of several publicly available translators and reveals whether mutual translation entropy is symmetric. Extending the proposed method to include the replacement of two tokens in a given pivot sentence demonstrates a multiplicative effect, where translation degeneracy is proportional to the product of the degeneracies of the two tokens. These findings establish translation entropy as a measurable property and objective benchmarking of artificial translators. Results are based on MarianMT, T5-Base and NLLB-200 translators."

Unlike conventional deep learning approaches that rely on extensive training, annotated datasets, and powerful GPU resources, THIR operates entirely without supervision. It extracts topological fingerprints directly from RGB histopathological images using cubical persistence, encoding the evolution of loops as compact, interpretable feature vectors. The similarity retrieval is then performed by computing the distances between these topological descriptors, efficiently returning the top-K most relevant matches. Extensive experiments on the BreaKHis dataset demonstrate that THIR outperforms state of the art supervised and unsupervised methods.

Although deep learning has achieved great success in many cross-modal tasks, its performance on SAR-Optical registration tasks is still unsatisfactory. Gradient-based information has traditionally played a crucial role in handcrafted descriptors by highlighting structural differences. However, such gradient cues have not been effectively leveraged in deep learning frameworks for SAR-Optical image matching. To address this gap, we propose SOMA, a dense registration framework that integrates structural gradient priors into deep features and refines alignment through a hybrid matching strategy. Specifically, we introduce the Feature Gradient Enhancer (FGE), which embeds multi-scale, multi-directional gradient filters into the feature space using attention and reconstruction mechanisms to boost feature distinctiveness. Furthermore, we propose the Global-Local Affine-Flow Matcher (GLAM), which combines affine transformation and flow-based refinement within a coarse-to-fine architecture to ensure both structural consistency and local accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that SOMA significantly improves registration precision, increasing the CMR@1px by 12.29% on the SEN1-2 dataset and 18.50% on the GFGE_SO dataset. In addition, SOMA exhibits strong robustness and generalizes well across diverse scenes and resolutions."

    "abstract": "Cyber-attacks jeopardize the safe operation of inverter-based resource-dominated microgrids (IBR-dominated microgrids). At the same time, existing diagnostic methods either depend on expensive multi-point instrumentation or stringent modeling assumptions that are untenable under single-point measurement constraints. This paper proposes a Fractional-Order Memory-Enhanced Attack-Diagnosis Scheme (FO-MADS) that achieves timely fault localization and cyber-resilient fault diagnosis using only one VPQ (voltage, active power, reactive power) measurement point. FO-MADS first constructs a dual fractional-order feature library by jointly applying Caputo and Grünwald-Letnikov derivatives, thereby amplifying micro-perturbations and slow drifts in the VPQ signal. A two-stage hierarchical classifier then pinpoints the affected inverter and isolates the faulty IGBT switch, effectively alleviating class imbalance. Robustness is further strengthened through Progressive Memory-Replay Adversarial Training (PMR-AT), whose attack-aware loss is dynamically re-weighted via Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) to prioritize the most challenging samples. Experiments on a four-inverter IBR-dominated microgrid testbed comprising 1 normal and 24 fault classes under four attack scenarios demonstrate diagnostic accuracies of 96.6% (bias), 94.0% (noise), 92.8% (data replacement), and 95.7% (replay), while sustaining 96.7% under attack-free conditions. These results establish FO-MADS as a cost-effective and readily deployable solution that markedly enhances the cyber-physical resilience of IBR-dominated microgrids."

We choose particles over the entire size ranges used in industrial-scale blast furnace and consider two different size ranges of pellet particles and four different size ranges for sinter and iron ore lumps. We perform image analysis to calculate size and shape-related properties of the grains. We select some of the common length scales used to measure the size of the particles and categorize them in different classes. We show that the length scales of a particular category class are well correlated with each other. We identify the independent, uncorrelated length scales for the particles from different categories. Using these uncorrelated length scales, we define different shape descriptors and obtain the distribution of these shape descriptors for each component of the blast furnace feed. Our image analysis results show that the cumulative distribution curves for these shape descriptors turn out to be nearly independent of the size range for a given type of material. Our study identifies the three key shape descriptors that are required to characterize the shape of the blast furnace feed. Two of these shape descriptors, namely the aspect ratio and the circularity, have been considered important by the researchers earlier as well. The third shape descriptor, the average contact eccentricity to the projected particle diameter ratio, usually not considered to be an important shape descriptor in previous studies, is of high relevance for Discrete Element Method simulations of granular materials."

Fast-time features of the neutrino luminosity and energy spectrum encode information about phenomena such as turbulence, convection, shock revival and potential quark-hadron phase transitions. In this study, we explore the detection capabilities of large-volume neutrino telescopes with a focus on IceCube and the planned extension IceCube-Gen2. Furthermore, we consider the effect on the detection sensitivity from wavelength shifters through enhanced light collection. A variety of models predict periodic fast-time features in supernova light curves; to quantify their detectability without relying on specific models, we investigate the detector response to a generic parameterisation of such features. We find that independent of feature frequency, IceCube-Gen2 instrumented with wavelength shifters has sensitivity to weaker modulations ($>25\\%$ amplitude) as compared to only the strongest modulations ($>50\\%$ amplitude) with IceCube. In addition, we examine the sensitivity of the neutrino lightcurve to sharp features from a quark-hadron phase transition. Phase transitions leading to a quark star remnant are detectable with IceCube at $5σ$ up to the edge of the Galaxy, and throughout the Small Magellanic Cloud with IceCube-Gen2 equipped with wavelength-shifters. In contrast, models collapsing into a black hole are observable only within the Galaxy, covering $41\\%$ of the CCSNe population for IceCube and nearly all ($91\\%$) for IceCube-Gen2 complemented by wavelength shifters.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuning techniques not only improve the adaptability to diverse downstream tasks, but also mitigate adverse effects of model quantization. Despite this, conventional quantization suffers from its structural limitation that hinders flexibility during the fine-tuning and deployment stages. Practical on-device tasks demand different quantization precisions (i.e. different bit-widths), e.g., understanding tasks tend to exhibit higher tolerance to reduced precision compared to generation tasks. Conventional quantization, typically relying on scaling factors that are incompatible across bit-widths, fails to support the on-device switching of precisions when confronted with complex real-world scenarios. To overcome the dilemma, we propose OTARo, a novel method that enables on-device LLMs to flexibly switch quantization precisions while maintaining performance robustness through once fine-tuning. OTARo introduces Shared Exponent Floating Point (SEFP), a distinct quantization mechanism, to produce different bit-widths through simple mantissa truncations of a single model. Moreover, to achieve bit-width robustness in downstream applications, OTARo performs a learning process toward losses induced by different bit-widths. The method involves two critical strategies: (1) Exploitation-Exploration Bit-Width Path Search (BPS), which iteratively updates the search path via a designed scoring mechanism; (2) Low-Precision Asynchronous Accumulation (LAA), which performs asynchronous gradient accumulations and delayed updates under low bit-widths. Experiments on popular LLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-1B, LLaMA3-8B, demonstrate that OTARo achieves consistently strong and robust performance for all precisions."

    "abstract": "In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of deep learning for music demixing. However, there has been limited attention on real-time, low-latency music demixing, which holds potential for various applications, such as hearing aids, audio stream remixing, and live performances. Additionally, a notable tendency has emerged towards the development of larger models, limiting their applicability in certain scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight real-time low-latency model called Real-Time Single-Path TFC-TDF UNET (RT-STT), which is based on the Dual-Path TFC-TDF UNET (DTTNet). In RT-STT, we propose a feature fusion technique based on channel expansion. We also demonstrate the superiority of single-path modeling over dual-path modeling in real-time models. Moreover, we investigate the method of quantization to further reduce inference time. RT-STT exhibits superior performance with significantly fewer parameters and shorter inference times compared to state-of-the-art models."

    "abstract": "Twin-wire laser directed energy deposition (TW-LDED) provides a promising route for alloying and fabrication of compositionally graded structures. However, inherent multiparameter coupling in twin-wire systems critically exacerbates both process instabilities and compositional inhomogeneity. This unresolved issue escalates into a fundamental technological bottleneck, as the underlying physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study developed a high-fidelity multi-physics and multiphase simulation framework coupled with experimental validation to reveal thermal-fluid behavior and heat-mass transfer mechanisms in TW-LDED using Inconel 718 and SS316L fine wires. Three distinct transition modes were identified: twin-wire melt droplet, twin-wire liquid bridge, and droplet-bridge mixed transitions, with the twin-wire liquid bridge regime delivering optimal stability and uniform mixing. Parametric analysis demonstrates that increasing wire feeding speed or decreasing wire initial height promotes stable liquid bridge formation, while small laser spots at low feeding speeds induce excessive volumetric energy density and bridge instability. Simulation and single-track experiments confirm that liquid bridge transitions reduce dimensional fluctuations by 85% while enhancing compositional homogeneity. Conversely, the melt droplet-bridge transition mode creates periodic flow switching and compositional discontinuities along the scan direction. Finally, a 60 mm functionally graded ring was successfully fabricated using optimized parameters, achieving uniform elemental distribution in the transition zone without significant segregation, validating the feasibility of TW-LDED for functionally graded components."

The most basic objective is the reachability objective, where a target set must be eventually visited, and the more general parity objectives can model all omega-regular specifications. For such objectives, the computational analysis problems are the following: (a) qualitative analysis that asks whether the objective can be satisfied with probability 1 (almost-sure winning) or probability arbitrarily close to 1 (limit-sure winning); and (b) quantitative analysis that asks for the approximation of the optimal probability of satisfying the objective. For general POMDPs, almost-sure analysis for reachability objectives is EXPTIME-complete, but limit-sure and quantitative analyses for reachability objectives are undecidable; almost-sure, limit-sure, and quantitative analyses for parity objectives are all undecidable. A special class of POMDPs, called revealing POMDPs, has been studied recently in several works, and for this subclass the almost-sure analysis for parity objectives was shown to be EXPTIME-complete. In this work, we show that for revealing POMDPs the limit-sure analysis for parity objectives is EXPTIME-complete, and even the quantitative analysis for parity objectives can be achieved in EXPTIME."

To overcome these challenges and to accelerate the adaptation of LLMs for telecom, we propose MM-Telco, a comprehensive suite of multimodal benchmarks and models tailored for the telecom domain. The benchmark introduces various tasks (both text based and image based) that address various practical real-life use cases such as network operations, network management, improving documentation quality, and retrieval of relevant text and images. Further, we perform baseline experiments with various LLMs and VLMs. The models fine-tuned on our dataset exhibit a significant boost in performance.

However, achieving precise control over the emission and disentangling the complex interplay between intraband and interband quantum pathways remains a central challenge. Here, we demonstrate through first-principles simulations that HHG in monolayer WS2 can be subjected to precise, complementary control by combining all-optical two-color laser fields with mechanical strain engineering. This dual-mode strategy provides unprecedented, orthogonal control over harmonic yield, polarization, and spectral features. We reveal that sculpting the two-color field's relative phase provides a sub-femtosecond switch for the quantum coherence of electron-hole pairs, thereby maximizing harmonic emission. Crucially, we uncover that tensile strain acts as a powerful amplifier through a dual mechanism - while strain-modified band dispersion enhances the intraband current, a profound reshaping of the Berry curvature (BC) dramatically boosts the anomalous velocity contribution to the interband response. This quantum geometric effect manifests as a robust, linear dependence of the harmonic yield on strain and a significant amplification of the perpendicularly polarized harmonics, providing a clear experimental signature for probing quantum geometric effects. Our findings establish a versatile framework for optimizing solid-state HHG and introduce a powerful all-optical method to map strain and quantum geometric properties of materials, positioning monolayer WS2 as a model system for exploring attosecond physics at the nexus of bulk and atomic scales."

Conversely, recent data-driven motion predictors capture complex non-linear dynamics but suffer from limited domain generalization and computational overhead. Through extensive analysis, we reveal that even in datasets dominated by non-linear motion, Kalman filter outperforms data-driven predictors in up to 34\\% of cases, demonstrating that real-world tracking scenarios inherently involve both linear and non-linear patterns. To leverage this complementarity, we propose PlugTrack, a novel framework that adaptively fuses Kalman filter and data-driven motion predictors through multi-perceptive motion understanding. Our approach employs multi-perceptive motion analysis to generate adaptive blending factors. PlugTrack achieves significant performance gains on MOT17/MOT20 and state-of-the-art on DanceTrack without modifying existing motion predictors. To the best of our knowledge, PlugTrack is the first framework to bridge classical and modern motion prediction paradigms through adaptive fusion in MOT."

To validate the key technologies required for wide-FOV X-ray polarization measurements, the Cosmic X-ray Polarization Detector (CXPD) CubeSat was developed as a prototype for the LPD. The CXPD is equipped with two Gas Microchannel Plate Pixel Detectors (GMPDs) that measure X-ray polarization via the photoelectric effect, where ejected photoelectrons produce ionization tracks in the gas which are imaged to reconstruct their emission directions. Laboratory calibrations of the modulation factor and energy spectra were successfully performed using linear polarized X-ray sources at 2.98 keV, 4.51 keV, 6.40 keV, and 8.05 keV. Since its launch in June 2023, the CXPD has successfully completed critical in-orbit technology verification. It has also performed polarization observations of two bright X-ray sources Sco X-1 and the transient Swift J1727.8-1613 yielding constraints on their polarization degrees and angles. Notably, this was the first time that an anti-coincidence detector had been implemented in an X-ray polarimeter, enabling in-orbit verification of the charged-particle background rejection algorithm. These results demonstrate the feasibility of wide-field soft X-ray polarization measurements and provide essential guidance for the development of the LPD for the POLAR-2 mission, thereby advancing the frontier of X-ray polarization astronomy."

A small set of interpretable descriptors (trough-line density, lifetime variance, and lifetime skewness) respond in nearly orthogonal directions across the (f_X, m_WDM) parameter space, enabling a substantial reduction of the degeneracy between heating and dark-matter suppression. These topological signatures remain detectable under SKA1-Low-like thermal noise, demonstrating that topology provides a stable and non-Gaussian probe of small-scale physics during Cosmic Dawn."

By studying the refraction law for null geodesics at the spherical shell, and taking account of the light travel time delay, the images are obtained by ray tracing a geometrically and optically thin accretion disk. For a static shell we identify three signatures: a redshift cusp at the shell, a V-shaped profile of the transfer function $r(b)$, and a loss of the one-to-one correspondence between photon spheres and photon rings on the observer's screen. During the collapse of the shell, the spacetime evolves from a stage with a single photon sphere inside the shell, through an intermediate stage with double photon spheres, and finally to a spacetime with a single photon sphere outside the shell. However, when the shell is released from a large distance, the corresponding images never show two separate photon rings, even in the stage with two photon spheres. In addition, the motion of the shell leads to a discontinuity in the redshift factor. These signatures provide a practical basis for testing the Israel junction in black hole spacetimes."

As a consequence, these statements are absolute between transitive models of $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ with the same $ω$, and in particular their truth value is insensitive to forcing extensions and to additional set-theoretic axioms such as $\\mathrm{CH}$ or large cardinal hypotheses.

    "abstract": "Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) are recognized as a promising avenue for achieving efficient, low-energy neuromorphic computing. Direct training of SNNs typically relies on surrogate gradient (SG) learning to estimate derivatives of non-differentiable spiking activity. However, during training, the distribution of neuronal membrane potentials varies across timesteps and progressively deviates toward both sides of the firing threshold. When the firing threshold and SG remain fixed, this may lead to imbalanced spike firing and diminished gradient signals, preventing SNNs from performing well. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-stage synergistic learning algorithm that achieves forward adaptive thresholding and backward dynamic SG. In forward propagation, we adaptively adjust thresholds based on the distribution of membrane potential dynamics (MPD) at each timestep, which enriches neuronal diversity and effectively balances firing rates across timesteps and layers. In backward propagation, drawing from the underlying association between MPD, threshold, and SG, we dynamically optimize SG to enhance gradient estimation through spatio-temporal alignment, effectively mitigating gradient information loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements. Moreover, it allows neurons to fire stable proportions of spikes at each timestep and increases the proportion of neurons that obtain gradients in deeper layers."

    "abstract": "Indoor semantic segmentation is fundamental to computer vision and robotics, supporting applications such as autonomous navigation, augmented reality, and smart environments. Although RGB-D fusion leverages complementary appearance and geometric cues, existing methods often depend on computationally intensive cross-attention mechanisms and insufficiently model intra- and inter-modal feature relationships, resulting in imprecise feature alignment and limited discriminative representation. To address these challenges, we propose DiffPixelFormer, a differential pixel-aware Transformer for RGB-D indoor scene segmentation that simultaneously enhances intra-modal representations and models inter-modal interactions. At its core, the Intra-Inter Modal Interaction Block (IIMIB) captures intra-modal long-range dependencies via self-attention and models inter-modal interactions with the Differential-Shared Inter-Modal (DSIM) module to disentangle modality-specific and shared cues, enabling fine-grained, pixel-level cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, a dynamic fusion strategy balances modality contributions and fully exploits RGB-D information according to scene characteristics. Extensive experiments on the SUN RGB-D and NYUDv2 benchmarks demonstrate that DiffPixelFormer-L achieves mIoU scores of 54.28% and 59.95%, outperforming DFormer-L by 1.78% and 2.75%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Sans a dwindling number of monolingual embedding studies originating predominantly from the low-resource domains, it is evident that multilingual embedding has become the de facto choice due to its adaptability to the usage of code-mixed languages, granting the ability to process multilingual documents in a language-agnostic manner, as well as removing the difficult task of aligning monolingual embeddings. But is this victory complete? Are the multilingual models better than aligned monolingual models in every aspect? Can the higher computational cost of multilingual models always be justified? Or is there a compromise between the two extremes? Bilingual Lexicon Induction is one of the most widely used metrics in terms of evaluating the degree of alignment between two embedding spaces. In this study, we explore the strengths and limitations of BLI as a measure to evaluate the degree of alignment of two embedding spaces. Further, we evaluate how well traditional embedding alignment techniques, novel multilingual models, and combined alignment techniques perform BLI tasks in the contexts of both high-resource and low-resource languages. In addition to that, we investigate the impact of the language families to which the pairs of languages belong. We identify that BLI does not measure the true degree of alignment in some cases and we propose solutions for them. We propose a novel stem-based BLI approach to evaluate two aligned embedding spaces that take into account the inflected nature of languages as opposed to the prevalent word-based BLI techniques. Further, we introduce a vocabulary pruning technique that is more informative in showing the degree of the alignment, especially performing BLI on multilingual embedding models. Often, combined embedding alignment techniques perform better while in certain cases multilingual embeddings perform better (mainly low-resource language cases)."

While one-step Gaussian policies enable fast inference, they struggle to capture complex, multimodal action distributions. Existing flow-based methods improve expressivity but typically rely on distillation and two-stage training when trained with Q-learning. To overcome these limitations, we propose to reformulate MeanFlow to enable direct noise-to-action generation by integrating the velocity field and noise-to-action transformation into a single policy network-eliminating the need for separate velocity estimation. We explore several reformulation variants and identify an effective residual formulation that supports expressive and stable policy learning. Our method offers three key advantages: 1) efficient one-step noise-to-action generation, 2) expressive modelling of multimodal action distributions, and 3) efficient and stable policy learning via Q-learning in a single-stage training setup. Extensive experiments on 73 tasks across the OGBench and D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves strong performance in both offline and offline-to-online reinforcement learning settings.

The objective is to ensure that the time-averaged reward vector converges asymptotically to a predefined target set. Since standard RL algorithms operate on scalar rewards, we introduce a dynamic scalarization mechanism guided by Blackwell's Approachability Theorem. This theorem enables adaptive updates of the scalarization vector to guarantee convergence toward the target set. Assuming ergodicity, the Markov chain induced by the learned policies admits a stationary distribution, ensuring all states recur with finite return times. Our algorithm exploits this property by defining an inner loop that applies a policy gradient method (with baseline) between successive visits to a designated recurrent state, enforcing Blackwell's condition at each iteration. An outer loop then updates the scalarization vector after each recurrence. We establish theoretical convergence of the long-run average reward vector to the target set and validate the approach through a numerical example."

This enables consistent relational reasoning and compound interaction modeling. Motion generation is formulated as joint-wise probabilistic prediction over the UIV, allowing the model to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies and produce coherent, context-aware behaviors. Experiments across three representative interaction tasks demonstrate that Uni-Inter achieves competitive performance and generalizes well to novel combinations of entities. These results suggest that unified modeling of compound interactions offers a promising direction for scalable motion synthesis in complex environments."

We introduce AA-Omniscience, a benchmark designed to measure both factual recall and knowledge calibration across 6,000 questions. Questions are derived from authoritative academic and industry sources, and cover 42 economically relevant topics within six different domains. The evaluation measures a model's Omniscience Index, a bounded metric (-100 to 100) measuring factual recall that jointly penalizes hallucinations and rewards abstention when uncertain, with 0 equating to a model that answers questions correctly as much as it does incorrectly. Among evaluated models, Claude 4.1 Opus attains the highest score (4.8), making it one of only three models to score above zero. These results reveal persistent factuality and calibration weaknesses across frontier models. Performance also varies by domain, with the models from three different research labs leading across the six domains. This performance variability suggests models should be chosen according to the demands of the use case rather than general performance for tasks where knowledge is important."

This paper introduces SLMQuant, the first systematic benchmark for evaluating LLM compression techniques when applied to SLMs. Through comprehensive multi-track evaluations across diverse architectures and tasks, we analyze how state-of-the-art quantization methods perform on SLMs. Our findings reveal fundamental disparities between SLMs and LLMs in quantization sensitivity, demonstrating that direct transfer of LLM-optimized techniques leads to suboptimal results due to SLMs' unique architectural characteristics and training dynamics. We identify key factors governing effective SLM quantization and propose actionable design principles for SLM-tailored compression. SLMQuant establishes a foundational framework for advancing efficient SLM deployment on low-end devices in edge applications, and provides critical insights for deploying lightweight language models in resource-constrained scenarios."

Understanding such nuances is a requirement for successful natural communication, and often requires building a local world model which encodes such elements and captures the dynamics of their evolving states. However, it is not well-understood whether language models (LMs) construct or maintain a robust implicit representation of conversations. In this work, we evaluate the ability of LMs to encode and update their internal world model in dyadic conversations and test their malleability under linguistic alterations. To facilitate this, we apply seven minimal linguistic alterations to conversations sourced from popular datasets and construct two benchmarks comprising yes-no questions. We evaluate a wide range of open and closed source LMs and observe that they struggle to maintain robust accuracy. Our analysis unveils that LMs struggle to memorize crucial details, such as tracking entities under linguistic alterations to conversations. We then propose a dual-perspective interpretability framework which identifies transformer layers that are useful or harmful and highlights linguistic alterations most influenced by harmful layers, typically due to encoding spurious signals or relying on shortcuts. Inspired by these insights, we propose two layer-regularization based fine-tuning strategies that suppress the effect of the harmful layers."

    "abstract": "MeanFlow (MF) is a diffusion-motivated generative model that enables efficient few-step generation by learning long jumps directly from noise to data. In practice, it is often used as a latent MF by leveraging the pre-trained Stable Diffusion variational autoencoder (SD-VAE) for high-dimensional data modeling. However, MF training remains computationally demanding and is often unstable. During inference, the SD-VAE decoder dominates the generation cost, and MF depends on complex guidance hyperparameters for class-conditional generation. In this work, we develop an efficient training and sampling scheme for MF in the latent space of a Representation Autoencoder (RAE), where a pre-trained vision encoder (e.g., DINO) provides semantically rich latents paired with a lightweight decoder. We observe that naive MF training in the RAE latent space suffers from severe gradient explosion. To stabilize and accelerate training, we adopt Consistency Mid-Training for trajectory-aware initialization and use a two-stage scheme: distillation from a pre-trained flow matching teacher to speed convergence and reduce variance, followed by an optional bootstrapping stage with a one-point velocity estimator to further reduce deviation from the oracle mean flow. This design removes the need for guidance, simplifies training configurations, and reduces computation in both training and sampling. Empirically, our method achieves a 1-step FID of 2.03, outperforming vanilla MF's 3.43, while reducing sampling GFLOPS by 38% and total training cost by 83% on ImageNet 256. We further scale our approach to ImageNet 512, achieving a competitive 1-step FID of 3.23 with the lowest GFLOPS among all baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/sony/mf-rae."

Motivated by this insight, we propose BP-FPN, a backpropagation-driven feature pyramid architecture that fundamentally rethinks feature learning for small target. BP-FPN introduces Gradient-Isolated Low-Level Shortcut (GILS) to efficiently incorporate fine-grained target details without inducing shortcut learning, and Directional Gradient Regularization (DGR) to enforce hierarchical feature consistency during backpropagation. The design is theoretically grounded, introduces negligible computational overhead, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing frameworks. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that BP-FPN consistently establishes new state-of-the-art performance. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first FPN designed for this task entirely from the backpropagation perspective."

Standard 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) pipelines fail when applied directly to underexposed inputs, as independent enhancement across views causes illumination inconsistencies and geometric distortion. To address this, we present DTGS, a unified framework that tightly couples Retinex-inspired illumination decomposition with thermal-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for illumination-invariant reconstruction. Unlike prior approaches that treat enhancement as a pre-processing step, DTGS performs joint optimization across enhancement, geometry, and thermal supervision through a cyclic enhancement-reconstruction mechanism. A thermal supervisory branch stabilizes both color restoration and geometry learning by dynamically balancing enhancement, structural, and thermal losses. Moreover, a Retinex-based decomposition module embedded within the 3DGS loop provides physically interpretable reflectance-illumination separation, ensuring consistent color and texture across viewpoints. To evaluate our method, we construct RGBT-LOW, a new multi-view low-light thermal dataset capturing severe illumination degradation. Extensive experiments show that DTGS significantly outperforms existing low-light enhancement and 3D reconstruction baselines, achieving superior radiometric consistency, geometric fidelity, and color stability under extreme illumination."

Existing data collection methods, such as crop cuts in randomly sampled fields at harvest time, are relatively time-consuming. Thus, we propose an approach based on prediction-powered inference (PPI) to supplement these crop cuts with less time-consuming field photos. After training a computer vision model to predict the ground truth crop cut yields from the photos, we learn a ``control function\" that recalibrates these predictions with the spatial coordinates of each field. This enables fields with photos but not crop cuts to be leveraged to improve the precision of zone-wide average yield estimates. Our control function is learned by training on a dataset of nearly 20,000 real crop cuts and photos of rice and maize fields in sub-Saharan Africa. To improve precision, we pool training observations across different zones within the same first-level subdivision of each country. Our final PPI-based point estimates of the average yield are provably asymptotically unbiased and cannot increase the asymptotic variance beyond that of the natural baseline estimator -- the sample average of the crop cuts -- as the number of fields grows. We also propose a novel bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap to construct accompanying confidence intervals. Even in zones with as few as 20 fields, the point estimates show significant empirical improvement over the baseline, increasing the effective sample size by as much as 73% for rice and by 12-23% for maize. The confidence intervals are accordingly shorter at minimal cost to empirical finite-sample coverage. This demonstrates the potential for relatively low-cost images to make area-based crop insurance more affordable and thus spur investment into sustainable agricultural practices."

We introduce WebCoach, a model-agnostic self-evolving framework that equips web browsing agents with persistent cross-session memory, enabling improved long-term planning, reflection, and continual learning without retraining. WebCoach consists of three key components: (1) a WebCondenser, which standardizes raw navigation logs into concise summaries; (2) an External Memory Store, which organizes complete trajectories as episodic experiences; and (3) a Coach, which retrieves relevant experiences based on similarity and recency, and decides whether to inject task-specific advice into the agent via runtime hooks. This design empowers web agents to access long-term memory beyond their native context window, improving robustness in complex browsing tasks. Moreover, WebCoach achieves self-evolution by continuously curating episodic memory from new navigation trajectories, enabling agents to improve over time without retraining. Evaluations on the WebVoyager benchmark demonstrate that WebCoach consistently improves the performance of browser-use agents across three different LLM backbones. With a 38B model, it increases task success rates from 47% to 61% while reducing or maintaining the average number of steps.

In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack that explicitly leverages the geometric properties of hyperbolic space. Specifically, we compute the gradient of the loss function in the tangent space of hyperbolic space, decompose it into a radial (depth) component and an angular (semantic) component, and apply perturbation derived solely from the angular direction. Our method generates adversarial examples by focusing perturbations in semantically sensitive directions encoded in angular movement within the hyperbolic geometry. Empirical results on image classification, cross-modal retrieval tasks and network architectures demonstrate that our attack achieves higher fooling rates than conventional adversarial attacks, while producing high-impact perturbations with deeper insights into vulnerabilities of hyperbolic embeddings. This work highlights the importance of geometry-aware adversarial strategies in curved representation spaces and provides a principled framework for attacking hierarchical embeddings."

    "abstract": "Electric trucks are increasingly deployed to reduce the trucking sector's carbon footprint, but their limited range and charging needs create operational challenges on mid- to long-haul routes. Truck platooning can mitigate range anxiety through energy savings and, in turn, influence routing and charging decisions, yet most existing studies focus on a single highway corridor and do not capture network-wide operations. We study electric truck platooning on a general road network, where trucks must select routes and charging stations with heterogeneous prices and charging speeds, form platoons on shared arcs, and possibly take detours that trade off platoon savings with additional labor hours. We further allow in-platoon position swaps so that leading responsibility rotates, balancing battery usage and avoiding early depletion of any single truck. To jointly optimize routing paths, charging-station choices, labor time, and platoon formation and position swaps, we formulate a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). Because exact methods become intractable on realistic instances, we develop an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) algorithm enhanced with a savings-based bounding scheme, infeasible-pair elimination, and candidate-station filtering. Computational experiments on test instances with up to 150 trucks show that incorporating platooning can reduce total operational costs by up to 2.77 percent, while the proposed algorithm cuts computation time by up to 99.96 percent compared with CPLEX and solves 150-truck instances in about 120 seconds, indicating strong potential for real-world applications."

    "abstract": "Financial markets are inherently volatile and prone to sudden disruptions such as market crashes, flash collapses, and liquidity crises. Accurate anomaly detection and early risk forecasting in financial time series are therefore crucial for preventing systemic instability and supporting informed investment decisions. Traditional deep learning models, such as LSTM and GRU, often fail to capture long-term dependencies and complex periodic patterns in highly nonstationary financial data. To address this limitation, this study proposes a FEDformer-Based Hybrid Framework for Anomaly Detection and Risk Forecasting in Financial Time Series, which integrates the Frequency Enhanced Decomposed Transformer (FEDformer) with a residual-based anomaly detector and a risk forecasting head. The FEDformer module models temporal dynamics in both time and frequency domains, decomposing signals into trend and seasonal components for improved interpretability. The residual-based detector identifies abnormal fluctuations by analyzing prediction errors, while the risk head predicts potential financial distress using learned latent embeddings. Experiments conducted on the S&P 500, NASDAQ Composite, and Brent Crude Oil datasets (2000-2024) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over benchmark methods, achieving a 15.7 percent reduction in RMSE and an 11.5 percent improvement in F1-score for anomaly detection. These results confirm the effectiveness of the model in capturing financial volatility, enabling reliable early-warning systems for market crash prediction and risk management."

    "abstract": "Time series forecasting under distribution shift remains challenging, as existing deep learning models often rely on local statistical normalization (e.g., mean and variance) that fails to capture global distribution shift. Methods like RevIN and its variants attempt to decouple distribution and pattern but still struggle with missing values, noisy observations, and invalid channel-wise affine transformation. To address these limitations, we propose Affine Prototype Timestamp (APT), a lightweight and flexible plug-in module that injects global distribution features into the normalization-forecasting pipeline. By leveraging timestamp conditioned prototype learning, APT dynamically generates affine parameters that modulate both input and output series, enabling the backbone to learn from self-supervised, distribution-aware clustered instances. APT is compatible with arbitrary forecasting backbones and normalization strategies while introducing minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across six benchmark datasets and multiple backbone-normalization combinations demonstrate that APT significantly improves forecasting performance under distribution shift."

While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable promise in multimodal reasoning, their application to complex human-computer interaction scenarios--such as strategy gaming--remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce Yanyun-3, a general-purpose agent framework that, for the first time, enables autonomous cross-platform operation across three heterogeneous strategy game environments. By integrating the vision-language reasoning of Qwen2.5-VL with the precise execution capabilities of UI-TARS, Yanyun-3 successfully performs core tasks including target localization, combat resource allocation, and area control. Through systematic ablation studies, we evaluate the effects of various multimodal data combinations--static images, multi-image sequences, and videos--and propose the concept of combination granularity to differentiate between intra-sample fusion and inter-sample mixing strategies. We find that a hybrid strategy, which fuses multi-image and video data while mixing in static images (MV+S), substantially outperforms full fusion: it reduces inference time by 63% and boosts the BLEU-4 score by a factor of 12 (from 4.81% to 62.41%, approximately 12.98x). Operating via a closed-loop pipeline of screen capture, model inference, and action execution, the agent demonstrates strong real-time performance and cross-platform generalization. Beyond providing an efficient solution for strategy game automation, our work establishes a general paradigm for enhancing VLM performance through structured multimodal data organization, offering new insights into the interplay between static perception and dynamic reasoning in embodied intelligence."

However, several challenges remain, including insufficient semantic richness of generated traffic elements, limited camera viewpoints, low visual fidelity of synthesized images, and poor alignment between textual descriptions and generated content. To address these issues, we propose a unified text-driven framework for both image generation and editing, leveraging a controllable mask mechanism to seamlessly integrate the two tasks. Furthermore, we incorporate both vehicle-side and roadside multi-view data to enhance the geometric diversity of traffic scenes. Our training strategy follows a two-stage paradigm: first, we perform conceptual learning using large-scale coarse-grained text-image data; then, we fine-tune with fine-grained descriptive data to enhance text-image alignment and detail quality. Additionally, we introduce a mask-region-weighted loss that dynamically emphasizes small yet critical regions during training, thereby substantially enhancing the generation fidelity of small-scale traffic elements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves leading performance in text-based image generation and editing within traffic scenes."

    "abstract": "Differential-driven wheeled robots (DWR) represent the quintessential type of mobile robots and find extensive appli- cations across the robotic field. Most high-performance control approaches for DWR explicitly utilize the linear and angular velocities of the trajectory as control references. However, existing research on time-optimal path parameterization (TOPP) for mobile robots usually neglects the angular velocity and joint vel- ocity constraints, which can result in degraded control perfor- mance in practical applications. In this article, a systematic and practical TOPP algorithm named TOPP-DWR is proposed for DWR and other mobile robots. First, the non-uniform B-spline is adopted to represent the initial trajectory in the task space. Second, the piecewise-constant angular velocity, as well as joint velocity, linear velocity, and linear acceleration constraints, are incorporated into the TOPP problem. During the construction of the optimization problem, the aforementioned constraints are uniformly represented as linear velocity constraints. To boost the numerical computational efficiency, we introduce a slack variable to reformulate the problem into second-order-cone programming (SOCP). Subsequently, comparative experiments are conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed method. Quantitative performance indexes show that TOPP-DWR achieves TOPP while adhering to all constraints. Finally, field autonomous navigation experiments are carried out to validate the practicability of TOPP-DWR in real-world applications."

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based 3D anomaly detection methods have demonstrated significant potential in industrial manufacturing. However, many approaches are specifically designed for anomaly detection tasks, which limits their generalizability to other 3D understanding tasks. In contrast, self-supervised point cloud models aim for general-purpose representation learning, yet our investigation reveals that these classical models are suboptimal at anomaly detection under the unified fine-tuning paradigm. This motivates us to develop a more generalizable 3D model that can effectively detect anomalies without relying on task-specific designs. Interestingly, we find that using only the curvature of each point as its anomaly score already outperforms several classical self-supervised and dedicated anomaly detection models, highlighting the critical role of curvature in 3D anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose a Curvature-Augmented Self-supervised Learning (CASL) framework based on a reconstruction paradigm. Built upon the classical U-Net architecture, our approach introduces multi-scale curvature prompts to guide the decoder in predicting the spatial coordinates of each point. Without relying on any dedicated anomaly detection mechanisms, it achieves leading detection performance through straightforward anomaly classification fine-tuning. Moreover, the learned representations generalize well to standard 3D understanding tasks such as point cloud classification. The code is available at https://github.com/zyh16143998882/CASL."

    "abstract": "This paper studies the interpretability of neural network features from a Bayesian Gaussian view, where optimizing a cost is reaching a probabilistic bound; learning a model approximates a density that makes the bound tight and the cost optimal, often with a Gaussian mixture density. The two examples are Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) using the bound for the marginal and autoencoders using the conditional bound. It is a known result, not only for autoencoders, that minimizing the error between inputs and outputs maximizes the dependence between inputs and the middle. We use Hilbert space and decomposition to address cases where a multiple-output network produces multiple centers defining a Gaussian mixture. Our first finding is that an autoencoder's objective is equivalent to maximizing the trace of a Gaussian operator, the sum of eigenvalues under bases orthonormal w.r.t. the data and model distributions. This suggests that, when a one-to-one correspondence as needed in autoencoders is unnecessary, we can instead maximize the nuclear norm of this operator, the sum of singular values, to maximize overall rank rather than trace. Thus the trace of a Gaussian operator can be used to train autoencoders, and its nuclear norm can be used as divergence to train MDNs. Our second test uses inner products and norms in a Hilbert space to define bounds and costs. Such bounds often have an extra norm compared to KL-based bounds, which increases sample diversity and prevents the trivial solution where a multiple-output network produces the same constant, at the cost of requiring a sample batch to estimate and optimize. We propose an encoder-mixture-decoder architecture whose decoder is multiple-output, producing multiple centers per sample, potentially tightening the bound. Assuming the data are small-variance Gaussian mixtures, this upper bound can be tracked and analyzed quantitatively."

Capturing the complete degree-of-freedom of force is imperative for accurate force measurement with six-axis force/torque sensors.

In this paper, a soft air-chamber type six-axis force/torque sensor with 16-channel barometers is introduced, which housed in hyper-elastic air chambers made of silicone rubber. Additionally, an effective decoupling method is proposed, based on a rigid-soft hierarchical structure, which reduces the six-axis decoupling problem to two three-axis decoupling problems. Finite element model simulation and experiments demonstrate the compatibility of the proposed approach with reality. The prototype's sensing performance is quantitatively measured in terms of static load response, dynamic load response and dynamic response characteristic. It possesses a measuring range of 50 N force and 1 Nm torque, and the average deviation, repeatability, non-linearity and hysteresis are 4.9$\\%$, 2.7$\\%$, 5.8$\\%$ and 6.7$\\%$, respectively. The results indicate that the prototype exhibits satisfactory sensing performance while maintaining its softness due to the presence of soft air chambers."

    "abstract": "We present a method for efficiently searching long-duration gravitational wave signals from compact binary coalescences (CBCs). The approach exploits the smooth frequency-domain behavior of ratios between neighboring waveform templates. The matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) time series of a data segment is first computed for a reference template, and the SNRs of nearby templates are then reconstructed by convolving this reference SNR time series with the ratio waveforms, defined as the frequency-domain ratios between the reference and neighboring templates. The computational speedup arises because the ratio waveforms can be safely truncated: they are significant only over a short interval approximately equal to the duration difference between the templates. Storing these truncated ratio waveforms is practical and enables additional efficiency gains, in contrast to storing full templates, which is generally infeasible for long-duration, low-mass signals. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method with mock non-spinning CBC injections in the $1-3~M_\\odot$ range. The reconstructed SNR time series agrees with that obtained from standard matched filtering to an accuracy of $O(10^{-4})$, while the relative computational cost is reduced by $\\gtrsim 25\\%$. With a truncation threshold of $10^{-3}$ applied to the ratio waveform amplitudes, the storage requirement is reduced by a factor of $\\sim 60$ relative to storing the full template bank."

In order to investigate the production of P by supernovae, we performed near-infrared (IR) [P II] and [Fe II] line mapping of 26 Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) with the Infrared Survey Facility and Kanata telescopes, using the narrow-band filters tuned to these lines. By combining our data with archival [Fe II] maps from UKIRT, we detected both the [P II] and [Fe II] emissions in five SNRs, only the [Fe II] emission in 15 SNRs, and no line emissions in the remaining six. Using the observed [P II]/[Fe II] ratios and upper limits for non-detections, we derived the P/Fe abundance ratios, which vary by up to two orders of magnitude among our sample SNRs. This suggests that the production rate of P and/or the degree of dust destruction may differ from remnant to remnant, the latter being due to the fact that P is volatile while Fe is mostly locked in dust grains. We used the mid- and far-IR maps to examine the dust content for the five SNRs where both the line emissions are detected. As a result, we find that high P/Fe abundance ratios in the northern and southeastern regions of Cassiopeia A and the Crab Nebula, respectively, are not likely due to dust destruction but may reflect an asymmetric ejection of P during supernova explosions. In the Crab Nebula, it is also possible that near-IR [Ni II] emission contaminates the observed flux in the southeastern region, suggesting that the Ni/Fe abundance ratio, rather than the P/Fe abundance ratio, is relatively high in this part of the remnant."

However, existing models struggle to accurately translate low-level actions (e.g., joint positions) into precise robotic movements in predicted frames, leading to inconsistencies with real-world physical interactions. To address these limitations, we propose MTV-World, an embodied world model that introduces Multi-view Trajectory-Video control for precise visuomotor prediction. Specifically, instead of directly using low-level actions for control, we employ trajectory videos obtained through camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and Cartesian-space transformation as control signals. However, projecting 3D raw actions onto 2D images inevitably causes a loss of spatial information, making a single view insufficient for accurate interaction modeling. To overcome this, we introduce a multi-view framework that compensates for spatial information loss and ensures high-consistency with physical world. MTV-World forecasts future frames based on multi-view trajectory videos as input and conditioning on an initial frame per view. Furthermore, to systematically evaluate both robotic motion precision and object interaction accuracy, we develop an auto-evaluation pipeline leveraging multimodal large models and referring video object segmentation models. To measure spatial consistency, we formulate it as an object location matching problem and adopt the Jaccard Index as the evaluation metric. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTV-World achieves precise control execution and accurate physical interaction modeling in complex dual-arm scenarios."

We address this issue by conducting an analysis of the information processing capabilities of the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance with finite samples. By utilizing the Poisson process and isolating the rate factor, we demonstrate the capability of capturing the pointwise density difference with Wasserstein distances and how this information harmonizes with support differences. The analyzed properties are confirmed using neural spike train decoding and amino acid contact frequency data. The results reveal that the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance highlights meaningful density differences related to both rate and support."

We explore whether manifold-learning tools can help with this separation problem. We built a CNN autoencoder trained on the confusion background and used its reconstruction error, while also taking advantage of geometric structure in the latent space by adding a manifold-based normalization term to the anomaly score. The model was trained on synthetic LISA data with instrumental noise and confusion background, and tested on datasets with injected resolvable sources such as massive black hole binaries, extreme mass ratio inspirals, and individual galactic binaries. A grid search over $α$ and $β$ in the combined score $α\\cdot \\mathrm{AE}_{\\mathrm{error}} + β\\cdot \\mathrm{manifold}_{\\mathrm{norm}}$ found optimal performance near $α= 0.5$ and $β= 2.0$, indicating that latent-space geometry provides more discriminatory information than reconstruction error alone. With this combination, the method achieves an AUC of $0.752$, precision $0.81$, and recall $0.61$, a $35\\%$ improvement over the autoencoder alone. These results suggest that manifold-learning techniques could complement LISA data-analysis pipelines in identifying resolvable sources within confusion-limited data."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed on mobile devices offer benefits like user privacy and reduced network latency, but introduce a significant security risk: the leakage of proprietary models to end users. To mitigate this risk, we propose a system design for protecting on-device LLMs using Arm Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), TrustZone. Our system addresses two primary challenges: (1) The dilemma between memory efficiency and fast inference (caching model parameters within TEE memory). (2) The lack of efficient and secure Neural Processing Unit (NPU) time-sharing between Rich Execution Environment (REE) and TEE. Our approach incorporates two key innovations. First, we employ pipelined restoration, leveraging the deterministic memory access patterns of LLM inference to prefetch parameters on demand, hiding memory allocation, I/O and decryption latency under computation time. Second, we introduce a co-driver design, creating a minimal data plane NPU driver in the TEE that collaborates with the full-fledged REE driver. This reduces the TEE TCB size and eliminates control plane reinitialization overhead during NPU world switches. We implemented our system on the emerging OpenHarmony OS and the llama.cpp inference framework, and evaluated it with various LLMs on an Arm Rockchip device. Compared to a strawman TEE baseline lacking our optimizations, our system reduces TTFT by up to 90.9% and increases decoding speed by up to 23.2%."

In this work, we present FFSE, a 3D-aware autoregressive framework designed to enable intuitive, physically-consistent object editing directly on real-world images. Unlike previous approaches that either operate in image space or require slow and error-prone 3D reconstruction, FFSE models editing as a sequence of learned 3D transformations, allowing users to perform arbitrary manipulations, such as translation, scaling, and rotation, while preserving realistic background effects (e.g., shadows, reflections) and maintaining global scene consistency across multiple editing rounds. To support learning of multi-round 3D-aware object manipulation, we introduce 3DObjectEditor, a hybrid dataset constructed from simulated editing sequences across diverse objects and scenes, enabling effective training under multi-round and dynamic conditions. Extensive experiments show that the proposed FFSE significantly outperforms existing methods in both single-round and multi-round 3D-aware editing scenarios."

    "abstract": "As climate change accelerates the frequency and severity of extreme events such as wildfires, the need for accurate, explainable, and actionable forecasting becomes increasingly urgent. While artificial intelligence (AI) models have shown promise in predicting such events, their adoption in real-world decision-making remains limited due to their black-box nature, which limits trust, explainability, and operational readiness. This paper investigates the role of explainable AI (XAI) in bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and actionable insight for extreme event forecasting. Using wildfire prediction as a case study, we evaluate various AI models and employ SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to uncover key features, decision pathways, and potential biases in model behavior. Our analysis demonstrates how XAI not only clarifies model reasoning but also supports critical decision-making by domain experts and response teams. In addition, we provide supporting visualizations that enhance the interpretability of XAI outputs by contextualizing feature importance and temporal patterns in seasonality and geospatial characteristics. This approach enhances the usability of AI explanations for practitioners and policymakers. Our findings highlight the need for AI systems that are not only accurate but also interpretable, accessible, and trustworthy, essential for effective use in disaster preparedness, risk mitigation, and climate resilience planning."

In operator theory and in Hilbert space based systems, coherence guarantees that equivalent operator networks produce identical effects on states and signals, maintaining both mathematical consistency and computational interpretability. This paper, the second installment of the Categorical Spectral Architecture (CSA) program, develops a unified framework that integrates operator theory, spectral analysis, and categorical algebra. Building on the functorial and spectral foundations established in the first paper, we introduce the Synergy Operad, a syntactic framework that extends the multicategory of Hilbert spaces and bounded multilinear maps. The Canonical Representation Theorem provides a structure-preserving functor that aligns syntactic compositions with operator semantics. Another central component, the Coherence Theorem, ensures that grammatical equivalences correspond to identical semantic results. Together these contributions identify a syntactic-semantic duality at the core of CSA and provide a rigorous basis for analyzing and constructing complex systems of operators with coherent and predictable meaning."

We combine an autoencoder-based representation with clustering and stability analysis to search for rare but reproducible genomic subtypes. On the UCI \"Gene Expression Cancer RNA-Seq\" dataset (801 samples, 20,531 genes; BRCA, COAD, KIRC, LUAD, PRAD), a pan-cancer analysis shows clusters aligning almost perfectly with tissue of origin (Cramer's V = 0.887), serving as a negative control. We therefore reframe the problem within KIRC (n = 146): we select the top 2,000 highly variable genes, standardize them, train a feed-forward autoencoder (128-dimensional latent space), and run k-means for k = 2-10. While global indices favor small k, scanning k with a pre-specified discovery rule (rare < 10 percent and stable with Jaccard >= 0.60 across 20 seeds after Hungarian alignment) yields a simple solution at k = 5 (silhouette = 0.129, DBI = 2.045) with a rare cluster C0 (6.85 percent of patients) that is highly stable (Jaccard = 0.787). Cluster-vs-rest differential expression (Welch's t-test, Benjamini-Hochberg FDR) identifies coherent markers. Overall, pan-cancer clustering is dominated by tissue of origin, whereas a stability-aware within-cancer approach reveals a rare, reproducible KIRC subtype."

Despite strong performance on medical knowledge and conversational benchmarks, foundation models trained on general text may lack the specialized knowledge required for these operational decisions. We introduce Lang1, a family of models (100M-7B parameters) pretrained on a specialized corpus blending 80B clinical tokens from NYU Langone Health's EHRs and 627B tokens from the internet. To rigorously evaluate Lang1 in real-world settings, we developed the REalistic Medical Evaluation (ReMedE), a benchmark derived from 668,331 EHR notes that evaluates five critical tasks: 30-day readmission prediction, 30-day mortality prediction, length of stay, comorbidity coding, and predicting insurance claims denial. In zero-shot settings, both general-purpose and specialized models underperform on four of five tasks (36.6%-71.7% AUROC), with mortality prediction being an exception. After finetuning, Lang1-1B outperforms finetuned generalist models up to 70x larger and zero-shot models up to 671x larger, improving AUROC by 3.64%-6.75% and 1.66%-23.66% respectively. We also observed cross-task scaling with joint finetuning on multiple tasks leading to improvement on other tasks. Lang1-1B effectively transfers to out-of-distribution settings, including other clinical tasks and an external health system. Our findings suggest that predictive capabilities for hospital operations require explicit supervised finetuning, and that this finetuning process is made more efficient by in-domain pretraining on EHR. Our findings support the emerging view that specialized LLMs can compete with generalist models in specialized tasks, and show that effective healthcare systems AI requires the combination of in-domain pretraining, supervised finetuning, and real-world evaluation beyond proxy benchmarks."

We propose ST-ProC, a novel graph-prototypical multi-objective SSL framework to address these limitations. Our framework synergizes a graph-prototypical core with foundational SSL Support. The core exploits the data manifold via graph regularization, prototypical anchoring, and a novel, margin-aware pseudo-labeling strategy to actively reject noise. This core is supported and stabilized by foundational contrastive and teacher-student consistency losses, ensuring high-quality representations and robust optimization. ST-ProC outperforms all baselines by a significant margin, demonstrating its efficacy in real-world sparse-label settings, with a performance boost of 21.5% over state-of-the-art methods like FixMatch."

    "abstract": "Active distribution networks facilitating bidirectional power exchange with renewable energy resources are susceptible to cyberattacks due to integration of a diverse array of cyber components. This study introduces a grid-level defense strategy aimed at enhancing attack resiliency based on distribution network planning. Our proposed framework imposes a security requirement into existing planning methodologies, ensuring that voltage deviation from its rated value remains within a tolerable range against dynamically and maliciously injected power at end-user nodes. Unfortunately, the formulated problem in its original form is intractable because it is an infinite-dimensional bi-level optimization problem over a function space. To address this complexity, we develop an equivalent transformation into a tractable form as mixed-integer linear program leveraging linear dynamical system theory and graph theory. Notably, our investigation reveals that the severity of potential attacks hinges solely on the cumulative reactances over the path from the substation to the targeted node, thereby reducing the problem to a finite-dimensional problem. Further, the bi-level optimization problem is reduced to a single-level optimization problem by using a technique utilized in solving the shortest path problem. Through extensive numerical simulations conducted on a 54-node distribution network benchmark, our proposed methodology exhibits a noteworthy 29.3% enhancement in the resiliency, with a mere 2.1% uptick in the economic cost."

Existing methods often utilize extensive sets of unlabeled amino acid sequences. However, these approaches neither explicitly capture nor harness the accessible protein 3D structural data, which is recognized as a decisive factor in dictating protein functions. To address this, we utilize protein residue graphs and introduce various forms of sequential or structural connections to capture enhanced spatial information. We adeptly combine Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Language Models (LMs), specifically utilizing a pre-trained transformer-based protein language model to encode amino acid sequences and employing message-passing mechanisms like GCN and R-GCN to capture geometric characteristics of protein structures. Employing convolution within a specific node's nearby region, including relations, we stack multiple convolutional layers to efficiently learn combined insights from the protein's spatial graph, revealing intricate interconnections and dependencies in its structural arrangement. To assess our model's performance, we employed the training dataset provided by NetSurfP-2.0, which outlines secondary structure in 3-and 8-states. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model, SSRGNet surpasses the baseline on f1-scores."

We show the existence of a pure-strategy equilibrium in the Publication Choice Problem and its uniqueness under binary researcher types. Our characterizations of the equilibrium properties offer insights about what publication behaviors better indicate a researcher's impact level. Through equilibrium analysis, we further investigate how labeling papers with ``spotlight'' affects the impact factor of venues in the research community. Our analysis shows that competitive venue labeling top papers with ``spotlight'' may decrease the overall impact of other venues in the community, while less competitive venues with ``spotlight'' labeling have the opposite impact."

These theories enable modular reasoning and coherent composition of complex systems, and have found applications in computer science, physics, and mathematics, including programming language semantics, quantum processes, tensor networks, operads, and higher algebra. Operator theory, in contrast, studies linear and multilinear transformations in functional spaces, forming the analytic backbone of modern analysis and quantum mechanics, with applications ranging from signal processing and control theory to data science. This paper explores the synergy between these two areas by showing how operator theory provides concrete analytic structures that naturally enrich multicategories, while multicategory theory supplies a unifying framework for organizing multi-input operators and ensuring coherence in complex networks. We develop a comprehensive categorical framework integrating operator theory with multicategories, introducing a symmetric monoidal multicategory of Hilbert spaces with bounded multilinear maps and establishing its enrichment and coherence properties. The framework includes a functorial spectral theorem, covariance under unitary transformations, and universality as a semantic target, providing a unified language for linking analytic structure, categorical semantics, and operator representations. This work lays the foundation for a broader research program uniting operator theory, category theory, and noncommutative geometry."

Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), there is an emerging opportunity to use TDC as an independent probe of dark energy. To take advantage of this statistical sample, we implement a scalable hierarchical inference tool which computes the cosmological likelihood for hundreds of strong lenses simultaneously. With this new technique, we investigate the cosmological constraining power from a simulation of the full LSST sample. We start from individual lenses, and emulate the full joint hierarchical TDC analysis, including image-based modeling, time-delay measurement, velocity dispersion measurement, and external convergence prediction. We fully account for the mass-sheet and mass-anisotropy degeneracies. We assume a sample of 800 lenses, with varying levels of follow-up fidelity based on existing campaigns. With our baseline assumptions, within a flexible $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology, we simultaneously forecast a $\\sim$2.5% constraint on H0 and a dark energy figure of merit (DE FOM) of 6.7. We show that by expanding the sample from 50 lenses to include an additional 750 lenses with plausible LSST time-delay measurements, we improve the forecasted DE FOM by nearly a factor of 3, demonstrating the value of incorporating this portion of the sample. We also investigate different follow-up campaign strategies, and find significant improvements in the DE FOM with additional stellar kinematics measurements and higher-precision time-delay measurements. We also demonstrate how the redshift configuration of time-delay lenses impacts constraining power in $w_0w_a$CDM."

This is then used to argue that all static configurations are extendable (more generally, all configurations admitting a non-null twistfree Killing vector field). One can thus draw from the extensive literature to straightforwardly extend to CINLE various known exact solutions, whereby the duality invariance of the Einstein-Maxwell theory allows for dyonic solutions even in more general theories. This is illustrated by a few explicit examples, including the homogeneous $Λ<0$ universe of Ozsváth, a black hole in the universe of Levi-Civita, Bertotti and Robinson, a generalization of the charged $C$-metric, and non-expanding gravitational waves in the Bonnor-Melvin background."

NIRCam images show a number of distinct continuum objects and evidence of interactions traced by diffuse emission, and the NIRSpec IFU cube reveals further strong line emitting regions. We identify six continuum and four additional strong Halpha emitting sources with weaker or no underlying continuum within the 3''x3'' IFU field. From spatial alignment with high-resolution radio data and emission line profiles, the radio AGN host galaxy is clearly identified. The bright Halpha emission (but not the optical components) is distributed remarkably linearly along the radio axis, suggestive of a biconical illumination zone by a central obscured AGN. The emission line kinematics indicate jet-gas interactions on scales of a few kpc. However, due to large relative velocities and presence of underlying continuum, the alignment with the radio structure appears to be, at least partly, caused by a particular configuration of interacting galaxies. At least four objects within a 10x10 (projected) kpc^2 area which includes the radio source have high stellar masses (log($M_\\star/M_\\odot)>10.3$) and star formation rates in the range 70-163 $M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Using a stellar mass-based analysis, we predict a total dark matter halo mass of $\\approx10^{13} M_\\odot$.

While synthetic data offers scalability and cost-efficiency, it often introduces systematic distributional discrepancies, particularly underrepresenting long-tail knowledge due to truncation effects from data generation mechanisms like top-p sampling, temperature scaling, and finite sampling. These discrepancies pose fundamental challenges in characterizing and evaluating the utility of mixed real-synthetic datasets. In this paper, we identify a three-phase scaling behavior characterized by two breakpoints that reflect transitions in model behavior across learning head and tail knowledge. We further derive an LLM generalization bound designed for real and synthetic mixtures, revealing several key factors that govern their generalization performance. Building on our theoretical findings, we propose an effective yet efficient data valuation method that scales to large-scale datasets. Comprehensive experiments across four tasks, including image classification, sentiment classification, instruction following, and complex reasoning, demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in data valuation with significantly low computational cost."

In addition to its 30~MW pool-type reactor, the RMB complex will include additional facilities for radioisotope production and related applications. $^{161}Tb$ is a promising radionuclide for radiopharmaceutical therapy, offering decay properties similar to $^{177}Lu$ but with additional conversion and Auger electrons that enhance dose delivery to cancer cells. In light of this emerging radioisotope, this study explores the potential production of $^{161}Tb$ in the RMB through neutron irradiation of enriched $Gd_{2}O_{3}$ targets. Monte Carlo (MCNP) simulations provided detailed neutron flux distributions, which were used as input for ORIGEN calculations of isotope buildup. Assuming 10 mg targets enriched to 97.5% in $^{160}Gd$, a 40-day irradiation, and a thermal flux of $2 \\cdot 10^{14}$ $n/cm^{2}s$, the results indicate that $^{161}Tb$ activity reaches approximately 4.5 GBq after 14 days ($\\approx 450 GBq/g$), in agreement with data from other research reactors. Building on prior studies that demonstrated the RMB's capability to irradiate larger targets, terabecquerel-scale yields appear feasible. These findings highlight the RMB's potential to support domestic production of emerging therapeutic radionuclides such as $^{161}Tb$.

We also compute the corresponding $pγ$ neutrino flux in the PeV-EeV energies and derive a time-integrated upper limit based on the effective areas of IceCube Gen2 and GRAND200k, providing the contributions of individual GRBs to the neutrino events. The predicted neutrino flux for GRB 221009A with model parameters inferred from multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution lies below the sensitivities of these detectors. Even under highly optimistic microphysical conditions, our correlation analysis infers that the events from this GRB are of order $\\sim 0.1$ for upcoming GRAND200k. We also compare neutrino fluxes for on-axis and off-axis viewing geometries and find that jet orientation alone can introduce nearly an order of magnitude variation in the signal. Thus, our studies imply that a GRB both brighter and closer than GRB 221009A would be crucial for any neutrino detections by upcoming neutrino telescopes. Future GRB detections by the CTA will provide important constraints on their geometry, radiation mechanisms, and any potential associated neutrino signals."

    "abstract": "On the basis of monotonic orbital-period variations, this study aims to identify genuine relationships between binary parameters and the rates of mass transfer (MT), mass loss (ML), and angular momentum loss (AML). Sample binaries with monotonic period variations are collected from the literature, together with well-determined binary parameters. Assuming the monotonic variations are responsible for any one of the MT, ML, and AML, their rates are calculated with the rates of change of period. After selecting crucial parameters using partial least-squares analysis, a parameter that exhibits the closest correlation with any one of the derived rates is further selected using partial regression plots. Moreover, power-law relationships are found for the discovered correlations. The properties of the sample binaries are also investigated by examining associations between binary parameters. In the systems with negative period variations, it is found that the rate of MT from more- to less-massive stars is a function of the primary radius; the AML rate is a function of the fill-out factor. In addition, the relationships between the mass ratio and stellar masses indicate that the ML rate relative to the MT rate decreases with increasing mass ratio below ~0.46. Meanwhile, in the systems with positive variations, it is found that the rate of MT from less- to more-massive stars is a function of the luminosity ratio and/or mass ratio; the ML rate is a function of the secondary temperature. The discussion also addresses possible processes occurring in the sample binaries."

The goal is to maintain solutions of high approximation and low total \\emph{recourse} (number of changes), compared with exact offline algorithms for the same input sequence. For the central cardinality constraint and partition matroid constraints we provide polynomial-time algorithms achieving both optimal $(1-1/e-ε)$-approximation and optimal competitive recourse for \\emph{any} constant-approximation. Key to our algorithm's polynomial time, and of possible independent interest, is a new meta-algorithm for $(1-1/e-ε)$-approximately maximizing the multilinear extension under general constraints, which we call {\\em approximate-or-separate}. Our algorithm relies on an improvement of the round-and-separate method [Gupta-Levin SODA'20], inspired by an earlier proof by [Vondrák, PhD~Thesis'07]. The algorithm, whose guarantees are similar to the influential {\\em continuous greedy} algorithm [Calinescu-Chekuri-Pál-Vondrák SICOMP'11], can use any cutting plane method and separation oracle for the constraints. This allows us to introduce cutting plane methods, used for exact unconstrained submodular minimization since the '80s [Grötschel/Lovász/Schrijver Combinatorica'81], as a useful method for (optimal approximate) constrained submodular maximization. We show further applications of this approach to static algorithms with curvature-sensitive approximation, and to communication complexity protocols."

In benchmarks across diverse distributions, PSS consistently outperforms k-nearest neighbor estimators and achieves accuracy competitive with recent normalizing flow-based methods, while requiring no training or auxiliary density modeling. The estimator scales favorably in moderately high dimensions (d = 10 to 40) and shows particular robustness to correlated or skewed distributions. These properties position PSS as a practical alternative to normalizing flow-based approaches, with broad potential in information-theoretic machine learning applications."

Our analysis shows that under sufficient coverage condition of the offline data, the policy is recursively feasible and admits provable, bounded optimality gap. These conditions establish an explicit trade-off between the amount of data collected and the tightness of the bounds. Our experiments show that this policy is between 100 and 1000 times faster than standard MPC, with only a modest hit to optimality, showing potential for real-time control tasks."

    "abstract": "Identifying cell types and subtypes from routine histopathology images is essential for improving the computational understanding of human disease. Existing tile-based models can capture detailed nuclear morphology but often fail to incorporate the broader tissue context that influences a cell's function and identity. In addition, available human annotations are typically coarse-grained and unevenly distributed across studies, making fine-grained subtype-level supervision difficult to obtain. To address these limitations, we introduce NuClass, a pathologist workflow inspired framework for cell-wise multi-scale integration of nuclear morphology and microenvironmental context. NuClass includes two main components: Path local, which focuses on nuclear morphology from 224-by-224 pixel crops, and Path global, which models the surrounding 1024-by-1024 pixel neighborhood. A learnable gating module adaptively balances local detail and contextual cues. To encourage complementary learning, we incorporate an uncertainty-guided objective that directs the global path to prioritize regions where the local path is uncertain. We also provide calibrated confidence estimates and Grad-CAM visualizations to enhance interpretability. To overcome the lack of high-quality annotations, we construct a marker-guided dataset from Xenium spatial transcriptomics assays, yielding single-cell resolution labels for more than two million cells across eight organs and 16 classes. Evaluated on three fully held-out cohorts, NuClass achieves up to 96 percent F1 for its best-performing class, outperforming strong baselines. Our results show that multi-scale, uncertainty-aware fusion can bridge the gap between slide-level pathological foundation models and reliable, cell-level phenotype prediction."

We study a generalization of this problem to sampling sets from given vectors in the hypersimplex, i.e., outputting sets of size (at most) some $k$ in $[n]$, while maximizing the sampled sets' overlap. Specifically, the expected difference between two output sets should be at most $α$ times their input vectors' $\\ell_1$ distance. A value of $α=O(\\log n)$ is known to be achievable, due to Chen et al.~(ICALP'17). We improve this factor to $O(\\log k)$, independent of the ambient dimension~$n$. Our algorithm satisfies other desirable properties, including (up to a $\\log^* n$ factor) input-sparsity sampling time, logarithmic parallel depth and dynamic update time, as well as preservation of submodular objectives.

The analysis begins with a Poisson process formulation, leading to a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation with jump terms that admits closed-form candidate solutions and yields a composite state variable capturing exposure to rare shocks. The framework is then extended by endogenizing disaster intensity via a nonhomogeneous Poisson process, showing how environmental degradation amplifies macroeconomic risk and strengthens incentives for abatement. A further extension introduces pollution diffusion alongside state-dependent jump intensity, yielding a tractable jump-diffusion HJB that decomposes naturally into capital and pollution components under power-type value functions. Finally, a formulation in terms of Poisson random measures unifies the dynamics, makes arrivals and compensators explicit, and accommodates state-dependent magnitudes. Together, these results establish rigorous verification theorems, highlight how vulnerability emerges endogenously from the joint evolution of capital and pollution, and show that the prospect of rare, state-dependent disasters fundamentally reshapes optimal intertemporal trade-offs."

Traditional devices often encounter limitations due to their dependence on empirical material design and basic signal processing techniques.

HSHI is designed to adapt dynamically to both inter-individual and intra-individual variability, transitioning health management from passive monitoring to an active collaborative evolution. The framework incorporates AI-driven optimization of materials and micro-structures, provides robust interpretation of multi-modal signals, and utilizes a dual mechanism that merges population-level insights with personalized adaptations. Moreover, the integration of closed-loop optimization through reinforcement learning and digital twins facilitates customized interventions and feedback. In general, HSHI represents a significant shift in healthcare, moving towards a model that emphasizes prevention, adaptability, and a harmonious relationship between technology and health management."

To enhance its applicability in real-world scenarios, this paper addresses a more challenging task: MVC under multi-source noises, including missing noise and observation noise. To this end, we propose a novel framework, Reliability-Aware Contrastive Deep Multi-View Clustering (RAC-DMVC), which constructs a reliability graph to guide robust representation learning under noisy environments. Specifically, to address observation noise, we introduce a cross-view reconstruction to enhances robustness at the data level, and a reliability-aware noise contrastive learning to mitigates bias in positive and negative pairs selection caused by noisy representations. To handle missing noise, we design a dual-attention imputation to capture shared information across views while preserving view-specific features. In addition, a self-supervised cluster distillation module further refines the learned representations and improves the clustering performance. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that RAC-DMVC outperforms SOTA methods on multiple evaluation metrics and maintains excellent performance under varying ratios of noise."

    "abstract": "This paper discusses the regulation of mass metadata surveillance in Europe through the lens of the landmark judgment in which the Court of Justice of the European Union struck down the Data Retention Directive. The controversial directive obliged telecom and Internet access providers in Europe to retain metadata of all their customers for intelligence and law enforcement purposes, for a period of up to two years. In the ruling, the Court declared the directive in violation of the human rights to privacy and data protection. The Court also confirmed that the mere collection of metadata interferes with the human right to privacy. In addition, the Court developed three new criteria for assessing the level of data security required from a human rights perspective: security measures should take into account the risk of unlawful access to data, and the data's quantity and sensitivity. While organizations that campaigned against the directive have welcomed the ruling, we warn for the risk of proceduralization of mass surveillance law. The Court did not fully condemn mass surveillance that relies on metadata, but left open the possibility of mass surveillance if policymakers lay down sufficient procedural safeguards. Such proceduralization brings systematic risks for human rights. Government agencies, with ample resources, can design complicated systems of procedural oversight for mass surveillance - and claim that mass surveillance is lawful, even if it affects millions of innocent people."

    "abstract": "Monocular height estimation plays a critical role in 3D perception for remote sensing, offering a cost-effective alternative to multi-view or LiDAR-based methods. While deep learning has significantly advanced the capabilities of monocular height estimation, these methods remain fundamentally limited by the availability of labeled data, which are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain at scale. The scarcity of high-quality annotations hinders the generalization and performance of existing models. To overcome this limitation, we propose leveraging large volumes of unlabeled data through a semi-supervised learning framework, enabling the model to extract informative cues from unlabeled samples and improve its predictive performance. In this work, we introduce TSE-Net, a self-training pipeline for semi-supervised monocular height estimation. The pipeline integrates teacher, student, and exam networks. The student network is trained on unlabeled data using pseudo-labels generated by the teacher network, while the exam network functions as a temporal ensemble of the student network to stabilize performance. The teacher network is formulated as a joint regression and classification model: the regression branch predicts height values that serve as pseudo-labels, and the classification branch predicts height value classes along with class probabilities, which are used to filter pseudo-labels. Height value classes are defined using a hierarchical bi-cut strategy to address the inherent long-tailed distribution of heights, and the predicted class probabilities are calibrated with a Plackett-Luce model to reflect the expected accuracy of pseudo-labels. We evaluate the proposed pipeline on three datasets spanning different resolutions and imaging modalities. Codes are available at https://github.com/zhu-xlab/tse-net."

Here, we propose an efficient quantum algorithm for the fidelity estimation, based primarily on the density matrix exponentiation and interferometeric scheme for mixed states, with a time complexity of $O(N^2/ε^7)$, where $N$ is the system size and $ε$ is a precision error. Our algorithm may serve as a resource-efficient technique to deduce fidelity of any two (pure or mixed) unknown or known quantum states, when the density matrices of the quantum states commute with each other."

Here we combine numerical simulations and scaling analysis to investigate a freely moving ice disc in a lab-scale water tank. We observe the disc remaining stationary or experiencing spontaneous motion, depending on the disc-water temperature difference and water depth. The motion is initiated by a buoyancy-driven, downward plume arising from water's density anomaly -- its density peaks near $4^\\circ$C. Crucially, the plume breaks rotational and mirror symmetries after descending beyond a critical distance due to a thermoconvective instability, thereby inducing the disc to move autonomously. Our findings quantitatively unify disc behaviors observed across independent experiments and establish a predictive criterion for the onset of disc motion. More broadly, we point to a route for thermally-driven transport: coupling of bulk thermoconvection and moving bodies, relevant to geophysical processes such as continental drift and iceberg capsizing."

This work presents a computer vision based framework for group activity recognition and action spotting using a combination of deep learning models and graph based relational reasoning. The system first applies Mask R-CNN to obtain accurate actor localization through bounding boxes and instance masks. Multiple backbone networks, including Inception V3, MobileNet, and VGG16, are used to extract feature maps, and RoIAlign is applied to preserve spatial alignment when generating actor specific features. The mask information is then fused with the feature maps to obtain refined masked feature representations for each actor. To model interactions between individuals, we construct Actor Relation Graphs that encode appearance similarity and positional relations using methods such as normalized cross correlation, sum of absolute differences, and dot product. Graph Convolutional Networks operate on these graphs to reason about relationships and predict both individual actions and group level activities. Experiments on the Collective Activity dataset demonstrate that the combination of mask based feature refinement, robust similarity search, and graph neural network reasoning leads to improved recognition performance across both crowded and non crowded scenarios. This approach highlights the potential of integrating segmentation, feature extraction, and relational graph reasoning for complex video understanding tasks."

The Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan--Lindblad (GKSL) equation uniquely characterizes Markovian dynamics that are completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP), yet many physical systems display non-Markovian features such as algebraic relaxation and coherence backflow beyond the reach of semigroup evolution. Fractional calculus provides a natural framework for describing such long-memory behavior through power-law temporal kernels introduced by fractional time derivatives. Here we establish a unified hierarchy that embeds fractional quantum master equations within the broader landscape of open system dynamics. The fractional master equation forms a structured subclass of memory-kernel models, reducing to the GKSL form at unit fractional order. Through Bochner--Phillips subordination, fractional evolution is expressed as an average over Lindblad semigroups weighted by a power-law waiting-time distribution. This construction ensures physical consistency, explains the algebraic origin of long-time decay, and bridges unitary, Markovian, and structured non-Markovian regimes. The resulting framework positions fractional calculus as a rigorous and unifying language for quantum dynamics with intrinsic memory, enabling new directions for theoretical analysis and quantum simulation."

The model encompasses non-Gaussian statistics due to an intermittent energy flux from large scales to small scales, thereby displaying hallmark features of turbulence. We explore this model using the Hopf functional formalism, which naturally leads to a decomposition of the complex non-Gaussian statistics into Gaussian sub-ensembles based on different realizations of the advecting field. We then characterize intermittency of the model using a numerical implementation, which takes advantage of this statistical decomposition."

    "abstract": "We investigate exciton confinement to a quantum wire in monolayer $\\text{MoSe}_2$ where the confinement is achieved by a p-i-n junction. We employ an effective-mass exciton model and solve the problem numerically, reflecting device geometries found in experimental state-of-the-art set up. Our method allows us to investigate the entire spectrum of confined states. We show the emergence of quantum confinement and study the dependence of the confined states as a function of electrical gate voltages, which are experimentally tunable parameters. We find that the confined states can be divided into bright and dark states with the dark states having small but finite oscillator strengths. Their oscillator strengths are low enough that they have not yet been detected in experiments, whereas the spectrum of the bright exciton states reproduces recent experimental measurements. Our results provide insight into the theoretical background of confined exciton states beyond the ground state and pave the way for the development of new confinement schemes as well as avenues to access the previously not detected dark states."

    "abstract": "Grammar competency estimation is essential for assessing linguistic proficiency in both written and spoken language; however, the spoken modality presents additional challenges due to its spontaneous, unstructured, and disfluent nature. Developing accurate grammar scoring models further requires extensive expert annotation, making large-scale data creation impractical. To address these limitations, we propose a zero-shot grammar competency estimation framework that leverages unlabeled data and Large Language Models (LLMs) without relying on manual labels. During training, we employ LLM-generated predictions on unlabeled data by using grammar competency rubric-based prompts. These predictions, treated as pseudo labels, are utilized to train a transformer-based model through a novel training framework designed to handle label noise effectively. We show that the choice of LLM for pseudo-label generation critically affects model performance and that the ratio of clean-to-noisy samples during training strongly influences stability and accuracy. Finally, a qualitative analysis of error intensity and score prediction confirms the robustness and interpretability of our approach. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in estimating grammar competency scores with high accuracy, paving the way for scalable, low-resource grammar assessment systems."

While numerous defenses have been proposed to mitigate these attacks, the heterogeneous landscape of evaluation methodologies hinders fair comparison between defenses. This work presents a systematic (meta-)analysis of backdoor defenses through a comprehensive literature review and empirical evaluation. We analyzed 183 backdoor defense papers published between 2018 and 2025 across major AI and security venues, examining the properties and evaluation methodologies of these defenses. Our analysis reveals significant inconsistencies in experimental setups, evaluation metrics, and threat model assumptions in the literature. Through extensive experiments involving three datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K), four model architectures (ResNet-18, VGG-19, ViT-B/16, DenseNet-121), 16 representative defenses, and five commonly used attacks, totaling over 3\\,000 experiments, we demonstrate that defense effectiveness varies substantially across different evaluation setups. We identify critical gaps in current evaluation practices, including insufficient reporting of computational overhead and behavior under benign conditions, bias in hyperparameter selection, and incomplete experimentation. Based on our findings, we provide concrete challenges and well-motivated recommendations to standardize and improve future defense evaluations. Our work aims to equip researchers and industry practitioners with actionable insights for developing, assessing, and deploying defenses to different systems."

We derive the slow roll parameters, the number of e-folds(N), the scalar spectral index $n_s$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and the tensor spectral index $n_T$ for the inverse tangent potential. We examine the inflationary observables using the data of the Planck-2018 and recent ACT collaboration and obtain constraints on the potential parameter $κ$. We also employ a reheating analysis by invoking the conservation of entropy between today and the time when reheating starts. We obtain bounds on the reheating temperature $T_{re}$ and the number of e-folds of the reheating $N_{re}$ using the spectral-index $n_s$ constraints from Planck 2018 and the ACT results.

    "abstract": "Traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods require large amounts of data to perform well, limiting their applicability in sparse or incomplete scenarios and forcing the usage of additional synthetic data to improve the model training. To overcome this challenge, the research community is looking more and more at Graph Machine Learning (GML) as it offers a powerful alternative by using relationships within data. However, this method also faces limitations, particularly when dealing with Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which can hide huge information due to their semantic nature. This study introduces Bi-View, a novel hybrid approach that increases the informative content of node features in KGs to generate enhanced Graph Embeddings (GEs) that are used to improve GML models without relying on additional synthetic data. The proposed work combines two complementary GE techniques: Node2Vec, which captures structural patterns through unsupervised random walks, and GraphSAGE, which aggregates neighbourhood information in a supervised way. Node2Vec embeddings are first computed to represent the graph topology, and node features are then enriched with centrality-based metrics, which are used as input for the GraphSAGE model. Moreover, a fusion layer combines the original Node2Vec embeddings with the GraphSAGE-influenced representations, resulting in a dual-perspective embedding space. Such a fusion captures both topological and semantic properties of the graph, enabling the model to exploit informative features that may exist in the dataset but that are not explicitly represented. Our approach improves downstream task performance, especially in scenarios with poor initial features, giving the basis for more accurate and precise KG-enanched GML models."

Existing methods mostly recognize action categories at a single granularity, which degrades the recognition accuracy of both base and novel action categories. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Grained Category-Aware Network (MGCA-Net) comprising a localizer, an action presence predictor, a conventional classifier, and a coarse-to-fine classifier. Specifically, the localizer localizes category-agnostic action proposals. For these action proposals, the action presence predictor estimates the probability that they belong to an action instance. At the same time, the conventional classifier predicts the probability of each action proposal over base action categories at the snippet granularity. Novel action categories are recognized by the coarse-to-fine classifier, which first identifies action presence at the video granularity. Finally, it assigns each action proposal to one category from the coarse categories at the proposal granularity. Through coarse-to-fine category awareness for novel actions and the conventional classifier's awareness of base actions, multi-grained category awareness is achieved, effectively enhancing localization performance. Comprehensive evaluations on the THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet-1.3 benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, our MGCA-Net achieves state-of-the-art results under the Zero-Shot Temporal Action Localization setting."

While most existing approaches follow an ego-centric paradigm by aggregating and diffusing features over the entire scene, they often overlook fine-grained object-level details, leading to semantic and geometric ambiguities, especially in complex environments. To address this limitation, we propose Ocean, an object-centric prediction framework that decomposes the scene into individual object instances to enable more accurate semantic occupancy prediction. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight segmentation model, MobileSAM, to extract instance masks from the input image. Then, we introduce a 3D Semantic Group Attention module that leverages linear attention to aggregate object-centric features in 3D space. To handle segmentation errors and missing instances, we further design a Global Similarity-Guided Attention module that leverages segmentation features for global interaction. Finally, we propose an Instance-aware Local Diffusion module that improves instance features through a generative process and subsequently refines the scene representation in the BEV space. Extensive experiments on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI360 benchmarks demonstrate that Ocean achieves state-of-the-art performance, with mIoU scores of 17.40 and 20.28, respectively."

    "abstract": "Self-reflection mechanisms that rely on purely text-based rethinking processes perform well in most multimodal tasks. However, when directly applied to long-form video understanding scenarios, they exhibit clear limitations. The fundamental reasons for this lie in two points: (1)long-form video understanding involves richer and more dynamic visual input, meaning rethinking only the text information is insufficient and necessitates a further rethinking process specifically targeting visual information; (2) purely text-based reflection mechanisms lack cross-modal interaction capabilities, preventing them from fully integrating visual information during reflection. Motivated by these insights, we propose REVISOR (REflective VIsual Segment Oriented Reasoning), a novel framework for tool-augmented multimodal reflection. REVISOR enables MLLMs to collaboratively construct introspective reflection processes across textual and visual modalities, significantly enhancing their reasoning capability for long-form video understanding. To ensure that REVISOR can learn to accurately review video segments highly relevant to the question during reinforcement learning, we designed the Dual Attribution Decoupled Reward (DADR) mechanism. Integrated into the GRPO training strategy, this mechanism enforces causal alignment between the model's reasoning and the selected video evidence. Notably, the REVISOR framework significantly enhances long-form video understanding capability of MLLMs without requiring supplementary supervised fine-tuning or external models, achieving impressive results on four benchmarks including VideoMME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and LVBench."

We use Stars and MUltiphase Gas in GaLaxiEs (SMUGGLE) to explicitly model the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) and employ sub-grid dynamical friction for massive black holes (BHs). Furthermore, we use a super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve AGN feedback coupling to the ISM at $\\sim10-100\\,$pc scales. By comparison between merging and isolated galaxies, with and without AGN feedback, we identify trends in the complex interplay between dynamics, BH fueling and feedback, and star formation and feedback. We consider three galaxy types: Milky Way analogs, Sbc-type galaxies, and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) analogs. The synergy between AGN feedback and merger dynamics is strongest in the Milky Way-like mergers, where the AGN winds are energetically dominant and entrain more gas when the initially thin disks become thick and amorphous during the merger. In contrast, the merger of thicker, vigorously star-forming Sbc galaxies is not strongly impacted by AGN feedback until star formation declines in the post-merger phase. Finally, while the sub-grid dynamical friction prescription effectively retains BHs in galactic nuclei during more massive mergers, the clumpy multiphase ISM induces significant wandering of low-mass BHs $\\mathrm{(<10^5M_\\odot)}$ in the shallow potentials of the SMC-like galaxies. These low-mass BHs wander at distances $\\gtrsim 2$ kpc from the galactic center, yielding negligible BH accretion and feedback.

Hyperspectral image reconstruction offers a practical solution by recovering HSI data from accessible modalities, such as RGB. While general domain datasets are abundant, the scarcity of human HSI data limits progress in medical applications. To tackle this, we propose SpectralAdapt, a semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) framework that bridges the domain gap between general and human-centered HSI datasets. To fully exploit limited labels and abundant unlabeled data, we enhance spectral reasoning by introducing Spectral Density Masking (SDM), which adaptively masks RGB channels based on their spectral complexity, encouraging recovery of informative regions from complementary cues during consistency training. Furthermore, we introduce Spectral Endmember Representation Alignment (SERA), which derives physically interpretable endmembers from valuable labeled pixels and employs them as domain-invariant anchors to guide unlabeled predictions, with momentum updates ensuring adaptability and stability. These components are seamlessly integrated into SpectralAdapt, a spectral prior-guided framework that effectively mitigates domain shift, spectral degradation, and data scarcity in HSI reconstruction. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in spectral fidelity, cross-domain generalization, and training stability, highlighting the promise of SSDA as an efficient solution for hyperspectral imaging in healthcare."

While graph Transformers aim to address this by enabling long-range interactions, they often overlook the inherent locality and efficiency of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). We propose a new concept called fractal nodes, inspired by the fractal structure observed in real-world networks. Our approach is based on the intuition that graph partitioning naturally induces fractal structure, where subgraphs often reflect the connectivity patterns of the full graph. Fractal nodes are designed to coexist with the original nodes and adaptively aggregate subgraph-level feature representations, thereby enforcing feature similarity within each subgraph. We show that fractal nodes alleviate the over-squashing problem by providing direct shortcut connections that enable long-range propagation of subgraph-level representations. Experiment results show that our method improves the expressive power of MPNNs and achieves comparable or better performance to graph Transformers while maintaining the computational efficiency of MPNN by improving the long-range dependencies of MPNN."

This relationship holds for the ground state $V \\rightarrow P γ$ processes here and suggests a broader applicability to radiative decays of ground-state vector mesons."

While the convergence of this PDE-based thickness to the geometric thickness had been rigorously justified only for simple geometries such as intervals and straight bands, its validity for more general shapes remained open. In this work, we extend the analysis to annular domains, where curvature effects are nontrivial. We prove that the PDE-based thickness converges to the geometric thickness as the diffusion parameter tends to zero by estimating the difference between two notions of thickness with the square root of the diffusion parameter. Explicit expressions involving modified Bessel functions are obtained for annuli, together with sharp inequalities for their ratios. These results provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the PDE-based thickness and demonstrate its potential as a reliable tool in shape analysis and topology optimization."

This problem can be especially challenging when: 1) the reference image is captured from an arbitrary viewpoint, and 2) the robot must operate with sparse-view scene reconstructions. In this paper, we address the IIN problem, by introducing SplatSearch, a novel architecture that leverages sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) reconstructions. SplatSearch renders multiple viewpoints around candidate objects using a sparse online 3DGS map, and uses a multi-view diffusion model to complete missing regions of the rendered images, enabling robust feature matching against the goal image. A novel frontier exploration policy is introduced which uses visual context from the synthesized viewpoints with semantic context from the goal image to evaluate frontier locations, allowing the robot to prioritize frontiers that are semantically and visually relevant to the goal image. Extensive experiments in photorealistic home and real-world environments validate the higher performance of SplatSearch against current state-of-the-art methods in terms of Success Rate and Success Path Length. An ablation study confirms the design choices of SplatSearch."

The core principle, Knowledge Guidance, avoids full replacement and instead fuses global knowledge into preserved local embeddings, attaining the personalization benefits of dual-knowledge within a single-knowledge memory footprint.

While these systems are increasingly integrated into commercial vehicles, recent research has exposed their vulnerability to physical-world adversarial appearance attacks. In such attacks, carefully crafted visual patterns are misinterpreted by TSR models as legitimate traffic signs, while remaining inconspicuous or benign to human observers. However, existing adversarial appearance attacks suffer from notable limitations. Pixel-level perturbation-based methods often lack stealthiness and tend to overfit to specific surrogate models, resulting in poor transferability to real-world TSR systems. On the other hand, text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model-based approaches demonstrate limited effectiveness and poor generalization to out-of-distribution sign types. In this paper, we present DiffSign, a novel T2I-based appearance attack framework designed to generate physically robust, highly effective, transferable, practical, and stealthy appearance attacks against TSR systems. To overcome the limitations of prior approaches, we propose a carefully designed attack pipeline that integrates CLIP-based loss and masked prompts to improve attack focus and controllability. We also propose two novel style customization methods to guide visual appearance and improve out-of-domain traffic sign attack generalization and attack stealthiness. We conduct extensive evaluations of DiffSign under varied real-world conditions, including different distances, angles, light conditions, and sign categories. Our method achieves an average physical-world attack success rate of 83.3%, leveraging DiffSign's high effectiveness in attack transferability."

    "abstract": "This study numerically examines the steady unconfined laminar flow of incompressible non-Newtonian power-law fluids past a pair of side-by-side counter-rotating circular cylinders using the finite element method. The cylinders simultaneously rotate at equal angular speeds in opposite directions, with the upper cylinder (UC) rotating clockwise and the lower cylinder (LC) counterclockwise. The numerical simulations are performed over wide parameter ranges: power-law index ($0.2 \\le n \\le 1.8$), rotational rate ($0 \\le α\\le 2$), gap ratio ($0.2 \\le G \\le 1$), and Reynolds number ($1 \\le Re \\le 40$). The detailed influence of these flow parameters on key flow characteristics, including streamlines, surface pressure, centerline velocity, and individual as well as total drag and lift coefficients, is systematically analyzed. For stationary cylinders ($α= 0$), a twin-vortex structure forms in the wake, which progressively vanishes with increasing rotation ($α= 2$). The surface pressure coefficient attains its maximum values for shear-thickening fluids ($n > 1$) at higher rotational speeds, irrespective of the gap ratio. The total drag coefficient ($C_D$) decreases with increasing $α$ and $n$, whereas the lift coefficient ($C_L$) exhibits a more intricate dependence on the flow parameters. The results provide fundamental insights into the interplay between rotation, non-Newtonian rheology, and geometric confinement in determining the hydrodynamic behavior of rotating cylinder systems."

    "abstract": "Exploits are commonly used to demonstrate the presence of library vulnerabilities and validate their impact across different versions. However, their direct application to alternative versions often fails due to breaking changes introduced during evolution. These failures stem from both changes in triggering conditions (e.g., API refactorings) and broken dynamic environments (e.g., build or runtime errors), which are challenging to interpret and adapt manually. Existing techniques primarily focus on code-level trace alignment through fuzzing, which is both time-consuming and insufficient for handling environment-level failures. Moreover, they often fall short when dealing with complicated triggering condition changes across versions. To overcome this, we propose Diffploit, an iterative, diff-driven exploit migration method structured around two key modules: the Context Module and the Migration Module. The Context Module dynamically constructs contexts derived from analyzing behavioral discrepancies between the target and reference versions, which capture the failure symptom and its related diff hunks. Leveraging these contexts, the Migration Module guides an LLM-based adaptation through an iterative feedback loop, balancing exploration of diff candidates and gradual refinement to resolve reproduction failures effectively. We evaluate Diffploit on a large-scale dataset containing 102 Java CVEs and 689 version-migration tasks across 79 libraries. Diffploit successfully migrates 84.2% exploits, outperforming the change-aware test repair tool TARGET by 52.0% and the rule-based tool in IDEA by 61.6%. Beyond technical effectiveness, Diffploit identifies 5 CVE reports with incorrect affected version ranges, three of which have been confirmed. It also discovers 111 unreported vulnerable versions in the GitHub Advisory Database."

    "abstract": "In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have excelled in language understanding and generation, powering advanced dialogue and recommendation systems. However, a significant limitation persists: these systems often model user preferences statically, failing to capture the dynamic and sequential nature of interactive behaviors. The sequence of a user's historical questions provides a rich, implicit signal of evolving interests and cognitive patterns, yet leveraging this temporal data for predictive tasks remains challenging due to the inherent disconnect between language modeling and behavioral sequence modeling. To bridge this gap, we propose a Collaborative Filtering-enhanced Question Prediction (CFQP) framework. CFQP dynamically models evolving user-question interactions by integrating personalized memory modules with graph-based preference propagation. This dual mechanism allows the system to adaptively learn from user-specific histories while refining predictions through collaborative signals from similar users. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively generates agents that mimic real-user questioning patterns, highlighting its potential for building proactive and adaptive dialogue systems."

    "abstract": "Local-life recommendation have witnessed rapid growth, providing users with convenient access to daily essentials. However, this domain faces two key challenges: (1) spatial constraints, driven by the requirements of the local-life scenario, where items are usually shown only to users within a limited geographic area, indirectly reducing their exposure probability; and (2) long-tail sparsity, where few popular items dominate user interactions, while many high-quality long-tail items are largely overlooked due to imbalanced interaction opportunities. Existing methods typically adopt a user-centric perspective, such as modeling spatial user preferences or enhancing long-tail representations with collaborative filtering signals. However, we argue that an item-centric perspective is more suitable for this domain, focusing on enhancing long-tail items representation that align with the spatially-constrained characteristics of local lifestyle services. To tackle this issue, we propose ReST, a Plug-And-Play Spatially-Constrained Representation Enhancement Framework for Long-Tail Local-Life Recommendation. Specifically, we first introduce a Meta ID Warm-up Network, which initializes fundamental ID representations by injecting their basic attribute-level semantic information. Subsequently, we propose a novel Spatially-Constrained ID Representation Enhancement Network (SIDENet) based on contrastive learning, which incorporates two efficient strategies: a spatially-constrained hard sampling strategy and a dynamic representation alignment strategy. This design adaptively identifies weak ID representations based on their attribute-level information during training. It additionally enhances them by capturing latent item relationships within the spatially-constrained characteristics of local lifestyle services, while preserving compatibility with popular items."

The study of the minimum number of edges in $\\mathcal{F}$-saturated graphs is a central topic in extremal graph theory. Let $(p+1)K_2$ denote a matching of size $p+1$. Determining the minimum number of edges in a $(p+1)K_{2}$-saturated graph is a fundamental question in this area, explicitly posed as Problem 9 in the survey by Faudree et al. (2011). In this paper, we refine the structural analysis of $(p+1)K_2$-saturated graphs and derive an explicit formula for the number of edges in terms of a single integer parameter. By minimizing this formula we determine $\\mathrm{sat}(n,(p+1)K_2)$ for all $n>2p$, thereby resolving Problem 9 in full generality and extending earlier results of Kászonyi--Tuza (1986) and Zhang--Lu--Yu (2024).

This relates to recent perturbative results of rough Dirichlet solvability in domains with drifts or potentials that satisfy a Carleson measure condition, which have also been considered earlier by Hofmann-Lewis and Kenig-Pipher. While we work in 1-sided chord arc domains, these results are new even for the half-space.

We show that cryo-EM images of proteins lie on low-dimensional manifolds that can be independently represented using sparse priors in predefined bases and generative priors captured by a denoising diffusion model. cryoSENSE leverages these low-dimensional manifolds to enable faithful image reconstruction from spatial and Fourier-domain undersampled measurements while preserving downstream structural resolution. In experiments, cryoSENSE increases acquisition throughput by up to 2.5$\\times$ while retaining the original 3D resolution, offering controllable trade-offs between the number of masked measurements and the level of downsampling. Sparse priors favor faithful reconstruction from Fourier-domain measurements and moderate compression, whereas generative diffusion priors achieve accurate recovery from pixel-domain measurements and more severe undersampling.

Building on this, we introduce \\textit{Visual Room} 2.0, a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating perception-cognition alignment of MLLMs. We model human perceptive and cognitive processes across three levels: low, middle, and high, covering 17 representative tasks. The perception component ranges from attribute recognition to scene understanding, while the cognition component extends from textual entailment to causal and social reasoning. The dataset contains 350 multi-modal samples, each with six progressive questions (2,100 in total) spanning perception to cognition. Evaluating 10 state-of-the-art (SoTA) MLLMs, we highlight three key findings: (1) MLLMs exhibit stronger perceptual competence than cognitive ability (8.0\\%$\\uparrow$); (2) cognition appears not causally dependent on perception-based reasoning; and (3) cognition scales with model size, but perception does not consistently improve with larger variants. This work operationalizes Seeing $\\ne$ Understanding as a testable hypothesis, offering a new paradigm from perceptual processing to cognitive reasoning in MLLMs. Our dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LHK2003/PCBench."

Here we investigate the possibility of preparing a many-body entangled ground state of a certain Hamiltonian, which can be called a quantum ``problem'' Hamiltonian, using the time evolution of an initial fiducial state by another ``solver'' Hamiltonian/s for a very short fixed (unit) time. The parameters of the solver Hamiltonian are optimised classically using energy minimisation as the cost function.

Inverse-designed photonics, empowered by optimization and learning algorithms, have emerged as a powerful paradigm for realizing compact and multifunctional integrated photonic components. In this work, we develop a staged-annealing topological optimization (SATO) framework tailored for the design of integrated terahertz (THz) beam-shaping devices. Employing this inverse-designed framework, we experimentally demonstrate a class of compact THz vortex beam emitters on an all-silicon on-chip platform. These devices efficiently convert the in-plane fundamental transverse electric (TE) waveguide mode into free-space vortex beams with mode purity up to 87% and energy conversion efficiency up to 74% across the target wavelength range (680 μm to 720 μm). The inverse-designed emitters exhibit ultracompact footprints (lateral size < 4λ) and a free-standing configuration, enabling the generation of dual-directional vortex beams carrying opposite topological charges. The proposed SATO framework provides a generalizable and fabrication-compatible approach for THz photonic device engineering, offering a scalable pathway toward complex structured beam manipulation in next-generation wireless communication systems and on-chip integrated THz photonic systems."

The proposed Multimodal Noise Generator (MuNG) enables efficient modality fine-tuning by injecting customized noise into the frozen MLLMs. Specifically, we reformulate the reasoning process of MLLMs from a variational inference perspective, upon which we design a multimodal noise generator that dynamically analyzes cross-modal relationships in image-text pairs to generate task-adaptive beneficial noise. Injecting this type of noise into the MLLMs effectively suppresses irrelevant semantic components, leading to significantly improved cross-modal representation alignment and enhanced performance on downstream tasks. Experiments on two mainstream MLLMs, QwenVL and LLaVA, demonstrate that our method surpasses full-parameter fine-tuning and other existing fine-tuning approaches, while requiring adjustments to only about $1\\sim2\\%$ additional parameters.

This dependence on solver-based data limits scalability and constrains exploration across physical systems. Here we introduce the Method of Manufactured Learning (MML), a solver-independent framework for training neural operators using analytically constructed, physics-consistent datasets. Inspired by the classical method of manufactured solutions, MML replaces numerical data generation with functional synthesis, i.e., smooth candidate solutions are sampled from controlled analytical spaces, and the corresponding forcing fields are derived by direct application of the governing differential operators. During inference, setting these forcing terms to zero restores the original governing equations, allowing the trained neural operator to emulate the true solution operator of the system. The framework is agnostic to network architecture and can be integrated with any operator learning paradigm. In this paper, we employ Fourier neural operator as a representative example. Across canonical benchmarks including heat, advection, Burgers, and diffusion-reaction equations. MML achieves high spectral accuracy, low residual errors, and strong generalization to unseen conditions. By reframing data generation as a process of analytical synthesis, MML offers a scalable, solver-agnostic pathway toward constructing physically grounded neural operators that retain fidelity to governing laws without reliance on expensive numerical simulations or costly experimental data for training."

The situation is quite different for small air vehicles that operate in urban canyons, around mountainous terrains, and in the wakes of marine vessels, where they could encounter highly unsteady atmospheric conditions with relatively strong gusts. The spatiotemporal scales of such disturbances can be larger than the characteristic aerodynamic scales of the small vehicles, making the relative effect of disturbance significantly stronger than what a large commercial aircraft would experience. The gust ratio can exceed 1 in these extreme flight environments, making stable flight difficult, if not currently impossible. We refer to the study of aerodynamics for gust ratios over 1, extreme aerodynamics, and identify major challenges that require breakthroughs, particularly with data-driven approaches. Extreme aerodynamics present unique opportunities for innovative analysis techniques to study rich flow physics problems with strong nonlinearity, transient dynamics, and low-dimensional modeling over a large parameter space. Some of the approaches discussed herein should apply to a wider range of fluid dynamics problems with similar challenges."

We find that these files are not static documentation but complex, difficult-to-read artifacts that evolve like configuration code, maintained through frequent, small additions. Our content analysis of 16 instruction types shows that developers prioritize functional context, such as build and run commands (62.3%), implementation details (69.9%), and architecture (67.7%). We also identify a significant gap: non-functional requirements like security (14.5%) and performance (14.5%) are rarely specified.

    "abstract": "Operating large autonomous fleets demands fast, resilient allocation of scarce resources (such as energy and fuel, charger access and maintenance slots, time windows, and communication bandwidth) under uncertainty. We propose a side-information-aware approach for resource allocation at scale that combines distributional predictions with decentralized coordination. Local side information shapes per-agent risk models for consumption, which are coupled through chance constraints on failures. A lightweight consensus-ADMM routine coordinates agents over a sparse communication graph, enabling near-centralized performance while avoiding single points of failure. We validate the framework on real urban road networks with autonomous vehicles and on a representative satellite constellation, comparing against greedy, no-side-information, and oracle central baselines. Our method reduces failure rates by 30-55% at matched cost and scales to thousands of agents with near-linear runtime, while preserving feasibility with high probability."

    "abstract": "Analyzing hand-object interaction in egocentric vision facilitates VR/AR applications and human-robot policy transfer. Existing research has mostly focused on modeling the behavior paradigm of interactive actions (i.e., \"how to interact\"). However, the more challenging and fine-grained problem of capturing the critical moments of contact and separation between the hand and the target object (i.e., \"when to interact\") is still underexplored, which is crucial for immersive interactive experiences in mixed reality and robotic motion planning. Therefore, we formulate this problem as temporal interaction localization (TIL). Some recent works extract semantic masks as TIL references, but suffer from inaccurate object grounding and cluttered scenarios. Although current temporal action localization (TAL) methods perform well in detecting verb-noun action segments, they rely on category annotations during training and exhibit limited precision in localizing hand-object contact/separation moments. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot approach dubbed EgoLoc to localize hand-object contact and separation timestamps in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces hand-dynamics-guided sampling to generate high-quality visual prompts. It exploits the vision-language model to identify contact/separation attributes, localize specific timestamps, and provide closed-loop feedback for further refinement. EgoLoc eliminates the need for object masks and verb-noun taxonomies, leading to generalizable zero-shot implementation. Comprehensive experiments on the public dataset and our novel benchmarks demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves plausible TIL for egocentric videos. It is also validated to effectively facilitate multiple downstream applications in egocentric vision and robotic manipulation tasks. Code and relevant data will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc."

    "abstract": "We consider the Grover walk on a finite graph composed of two arbitrary simple graphs connected by one edge, referred to as a bridge. The parameter $ε>0$ assigned at the bridge represents the strength of connectivity: if $ε=0$, then the graph is completely separated. We show that for sufficiently small values of $ε$, a phenomenon called pulsation occurs. The pulsation is characterized by the periodic transfer of the quantum walker between the two graphs. An asymptotic expression with respect to small $ε$ for the probability of finding the walker on either of the two graphs is derived. This expression reveals that the pulsation depends solely on the number of edges in each graph, regardless of their structure. In addition, we obtain that the quantum walker is transferred periodically between the two graphs, with a period of order $O(ε^{-1/2})$. Furthermore, when the number of edges of two graphs is equal, the quantum walker is almost completely transferred."

Serving such models on conventional hardware is challenging due to limited DRAM capacity and high GPU costs. Thus, in this work, we propose offloading the single-batch token generation to a 3D NAND flash processing-in-memory (PIM) device, leveraging its high storage density to overcome the DRAM capacity wall. We explore 3D NAND flash configurations and present a re-architected PIM array with an H-tree network for optimal latency and cell density. Along with the well-chosen PIM array size, we develop operation tiling and mapping methods for LLM layers, achieving a 2.4x speedup over four RTX4090 with vLLM and comparable performance to four A100 with only 4.9% latency overhead. Our detailed area analysis reveals that the proposed 3D NAND flash PIM architecture can be integrated within a 4.98mm2 die area under the memory array, without extra area overhead."

However, due to the exponential scaling cost of the protocol with system size, many approaches have been developed for quantum states with specific structure, such as low-rank states. In this paper, we show how approximate message passing (AMP), a compressed sensing technique, can be used to perform low-rank QST. AMP provides asymptotically optimal performance guarantees for large systems, which suggests its utility for QST. We discuss the design challenges that come with applying AMP to QST, and show that by properly designing the AMP algorithm, we can reduce the reconstruction infidelity by over an order of magnitude compared to existing approaches to low-rank QST. We also performed tomographic experiments on IBM Kingston and considered the effect of device noise on the reliability of the predicted fidelity of state preparation. Our work advances the state of low-rank QST and may be applicable to other quantum tomography protocols."

    "abstract": "Critical systems, such as those used in healthcare, defence, and disaster management, demand rigorous requirements engineering to ensure safety and reliability. Yet, much of this rigour has traditionally focused on technical assurance, often overlooking the human and social contexts in which these systems operate. This paper argues that considering human-centric aspects is an essential dimension of dependability, and presents a human-centred RE process designed to integrate social responsibility into critical system development. Drawing from a literature review, we identified a set of guidelines for designing software for vulnerable communities and translated these into sixty-two functional and non-functional requirements. These requirements were operationalised through the design of an adaptive early warning system prototype, which was subsequently evaluated through six interviews and eight cognitive walkthroughs to validate their relevance and applicability. The findings demonstrate that human-centric requirements, when addressed early, enhance the usability and accessibility of systems for all users. The paper concludes by positioning human-centricity not as an ethical add-on but as a defining quality of safe and equitable critical systems."

It is widely applied in fields such as information retrieval, content summarisation, and trend analysis across various disciplines. However, probabilistic topic models can produce different results when rerun due to their stochastic nature, leading to inconsistencies in latent topics. Factors like corpus shuffling, rare text removal, and document elimination contribute to these variations. This instability affects replicability, reliability, and interpretation, raising concerns about whether topic models capture meaningful topics or just noise. To address these problems, we defined a new stability measure that incorporates accuracy and consistency and uses the generative properties of LDA to generate a new corpus with ground truth. These generated corpora are run through LDA 50 times to determine the variability in the output. We show that LDA can correctly determine the underlying number of topics in the documents. We also find that LDA is more internally consistent, as the multiple reruns return similar topics; however, these topics are not the true topics."

We present and release a novel dataset of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) recordings collected from 25 human participants across three domains: a Pick-and-Place Robot, Lunar Lander, and Flappy Bird. We train classifiers to predict levels of agent performance (optimal, sub-optimal, or worst-case) from windows of preprocessed fNIRS feature vectors, achieving an average F1 score of 67% for binary classification and 46% for multi-class models averaged across conditions and domains. We also train regressors to predict the degree of deviation between an agent's chosen action and a set of near-optimal policies, providing a continuous measure of performance. We evaluate cross-subject generalization and demonstrate that fine-tuning pre-trained models with a small sample of subject-specific data increases average F1 scores by 17% and 41% for binary and multi-class models, respectively. Our work demonstrates that mapping implicit fNIRS signals to agent performance is feasible and can be improved, laying the foundation for future brain-driven RLHF systems."

    "abstract": "Humans display significant uncertainty when confronted with moral dilemmas, yet the extent of such uncertainty in machines and AI agents remains underexplored. Recent studies have confirmed the overly confident tendencies of machine-generated responses, particularly in large language models (LLMs). As these systems are increasingly embedded in ethical decision-making scenarios, it is important to understand their moral reasoning and the inherent uncertainties in building reliable AI systems. This work examines how uncertainty influences moral decisions in the classical trolley problem, analyzing responses from 32 open-source models and 9 distinct moral dimensions. We first find that variance in model confidence is greater across models than within moral dimensions, suggesting that moral uncertainty is predominantly shaped by model architecture and training method. To quantify uncertainty, we measure binary entropy as a linear combination of total entropy, conditional entropy, and mutual information. To examine its effects, we introduce stochasticity into models via \"dropout\" at inference time. Our findings show that our mechanism increases total entropy, mainly through a rise in mutual information, while conditional entropy remains largely unchanged. Moreover, this mechanism significantly improves human-LLM moral alignment, with correlations in mutual information and alignment score shifts. Our results highlight the potential to better align model-generated decisions and human preferences by deliberately modulating uncertainty and reducing LLMs' confidence in morally complex scenarios."

To address this issue, we present SkyReels-Text, a novel font-controllable framework for precise poster text editing. Our method enables simultaneous editing of multiple text regions, each rendered in distinct typographic styles, while preserving the visual appearance of non-edited regions. Notably, our model requires neither font labels nor fine-tuning during inference: users can simply provide cropped glyph patches corresponding to their desired typography, even if the font is not included in any standard library. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, including handwrittent text benchmarks, SkyReels-Text achieves state-of-the-art performance in both text fidelity and visual realism, offering unprecedented control over font families, and stylistic nuances. This work bridges the gap between general-purpose image editing and professional-grade typographic design."

Prevailing in-the-wild human mesh pseudo-ground-truth (pGT) generation pipelines are single-person-centric, where each human is processed individually without joint optimization. This oversight leads to a lack of scene-level consistency, producing individuals with conflicting depths and scales within the same image. To address this, we introduce Depth-conditioned Translation Optimization (DTO), a novel optimization-based method that jointly refines the camera-space translations of all individuals in a crowd. By leveraging anthropometric priors on human height and depth cues from a monocular depth estimator, DTO solves for a scene-consistent placement of all subjects within a principled Maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework. Applying DTO to the 4D-Humans dataset, we construct DTO-Humans, a new large-scale pGT dataset of 0.56M high-quality, scene-consistent multi-person images, featuring dense crowds with an average of 4.8 persons per image. Furthermore, we propose Metric-Aware HMR, an end-to-end network that directly estimates human mesh and camera parameters in metric scale. This is enabled by a camera branch and a novel relative metric loss that enforces plausible relative scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on relative depth reasoning and human mesh recovery. Code and data will be released publicly."

The method self-consistently couples the ejecta circumstellar medium (CSM) shock dynamics to radiative diffusion from a moving heating boundary tied to the shocks, so that both the photon escape path and the effective diffusion time evolve with radius and time. We solve the mass and momentum equations for the forward and reverse shocks together with the diffusion equation in the unshocked CSM. TransFit-CSM reproduces the canonical sequence of an early dark phase, a diffusion-mediated rise and peak, and a post-interaction cooling tail, and it clarifies why Arnett-like peak scalings break down in optically thick CSM. The framework is well suited for Bayesian inference and constrains physical parameters of the ejecta and CSM from bolometric or joint multi-band light curves. Applications to SN 2006gy and SN 2010jl yield accurate fits and physically interpretable posteriors, highlighting the dominant role of pre-supernova mass loss in shaping the observables. Because it is both computationally efficient and physically grounded, TransFit-CSM bridges simple analytic prescriptions and radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, enabling population-level inference for current and future time-domain surveys."

The emerged misinformation with low creation cost and high deception poses significant threats to society. While recent studies leverage general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve remarkable results in detection, they encounter two critical limitations: (1) Insufficient reasoning, where general-purpose MLLMs often follow the uniform reasoning paradigm but generate inaccurate explanations and judgments, due to the lack of the task-specific knowledge of multimodal misinformation detection. (2) Reasoning biases, where a single thinking mode make detectors a suboptimal path for judgment, struggling to keep pace with the fast-growing and intricate multimodal misinformation. In this paper, we propose MMD-Thinker, a two-stage framework for multimodal misinformation detection through adaptive multi-dimensional thinking. First, we develop tailor-designed thinking mode for multimodal misinformation detection. Second, we adopt task-specific instruction tuning to inject the tailored thinking mode into general-purpose MLLMs. Third, we further leverage reinforcement learning strategy with a mixed advantage function, which incentivizes the reasoning capabilities in trajectories. Furthermore, we construct the multimodal misinformation reasoning (MMR) dataset, encompasses more than 8K image-text pairs with both reasoning processes and classification labels, to make progress in the relam of multimodal misinformation detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MMD-Thinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmark datasets, while maintaining flexible inference and token usage.

While CDM remains the widely accepted model, SIDM was introduced to potentially help resolve the discrepancies between the predictions of the CDM model and observational data, in particular the predicted central density profiles. Previous work involving simulations of small numbers of Milky Way-mass galaxies shows that SIDM delays massive black hole mergers as compared to CDM when the host halo has a flattened central density profile. It is, however, unclear how well massive black hole observations are able to differentiate between CDM and SIDM. In this work, we use mock gravitational wave observations of massive black hole mergers from LISA, a space-based gravitational wave observatory set to launch in the 2030s, to test LISA's capability to indirectly probe dark matter physics. As a proof of concept, we show that LISA may be able to distinguish between CDM and SIDM with a short-range interaction and a constant cross section of 1 $\\rm{cm^2~ g^{-1}}$ at the $\\sim2σ$ level or greater, provided at least $\\sim80$ massive black hole mergers are observed with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 10.

Foley requires generating audio that is both semantically aligned with visible events and temporally aligned with their timing. Yet, there is a mismatch between evaluation and downstream applications due to the absence of a benchmark tailored to Foley-style scenarios. We find that 74% of videos from past evaluation datasets have poor audio-visual correspondence. Moreover, they are dominated by speech and music, domains that lie outside the use case for Foley. To address this gap, we introduce FoleyBench, the first large-scale benchmark explicitly designed for Foley-style V2A evaluation. FoleyBench contains 5,000 (video, ground-truth audio, text caption) triplets, each featuring visible sound sources with audio causally tied to on-screen events. The dataset is built using an automated, scalable pipeline applied to in-the-wild internet videos from YouTube-based and Vimeo-based sources. Compared to past datasets, we show that videos from FoleyBench have stronger coverage of sound categories from a taxonomy specifically designed for Foley sound. Each clip is further labeled with metadata capturing source complexity, UCS/AudioSet category, and video length, enabling fine-grained analysis of model performance and failure modes.

    "abstract": "Despite recent advancements in 3D-text cross-modal alignment, existing state-of-the-art methods still struggle to align fine-grained textual semantics with detailed geometric structures, and their alignment performance degrades significantly when scaling to large-scale 3D databases. To overcome this limitation, we introduce 3DAlign-DAER, a unified framework designed to align text and 3D geometry via the proposed dynamic attention policy and the efficient retrieval strategy, capturing subtle correspondences for diverse cross-modal retrieval and classification tasks. Specifically, during the training, our proposed dynamic attention policy (DAP) employs the Hierarchical Attention Fusion (HAF) module to represent the alignment as learnable fine-grained token-to-point attentions. To optimize these attentions across different tasks and geometric hierarchies, our DAP further exploits the Monte Carlo tree search to dynamically calibrate HAF attention weights via a hybrid reward signal and further enhances the alignment between textual descriptions and local 3D geometry. During the inference, our 3DAlign-DAER introduces an Efficient Retrieval Strategy (ERS) to leverage efficient hierarchical searching in the large-scale embedding spaces, outperforming traditional methods (e.g., KNN) in accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, to facilitate text-3D alignment research and train our 3DAlign-DAER, we construct Align3D-2M, a large-scale dataset featuring 2M text-3D pairs, to provide sufficient fine-grained cross-modal annotations. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our 3DAlign-DAER on diverse benchmarks. We will release our codes, models, and datasets."

    "abstract": "Existing multi-person video pose estimation methods typically adopt a two-stage pipeline: detecting individuals in each frame, followed by temporal modeling for single-person pose estimation. This design relies on heuristic operations such as detection, RoI cropping, and non-maximum suppression (NMS), limiting both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we present a fully end-to-end framework for multi-person 2D pose estimation in videos, effectively eliminating heuristic operations. A key challenge is to associate individuals across frames under complex and overlapping temporal trajectories. To address this, we introduce a novel Pose-Aware Video transformEr Network (PAVE-Net), which features a spatial encoder to model intra-frame relations and a spatiotemporal pose decoder to capture global dependencies across frames. To achieve accurate temporal association, we propose a pose-aware attention mechanism that enables each pose query to selectively aggregate features corresponding to the same individual across consecutive frames.Additionally, we explicitly model spatiotemporal dependencies among pose keypoints to improve accuracy. Notably, our approach is the first end-to-end method for multi-frame 2D human pose estimation.Extensive experiments show that PAVE-Net substantially outperforms prior image-based end-to-end methods, achieving a \\textbf{6.0} mAP improvement on PoseTrack2017, and delivers accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art two-stage video-based approaches, while offering significant gains in efficiency.Project page: https://github.com/zgspose/PAVENet"

We study the process of greedy minimum weight base packings in general matroids and explore its algorithmic applications. When specialized to bicircular matroids, our results yield an algorithm for the approximate fully-dynamic densest subgraph density $ρ$. We maintain a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation of the density with a worst-case update time $O((ρ\\varepsilon^{-2}+\\varepsilon^{-4})ρ\\log^3 m)$. It improves the dependency on $\\varepsilon$ from the current state-of-the-art worst-case update time complexity $O(\\varepsilon^{-6}\\log^3 n\\logρ)$ [Chekuri, Christiansen, Holm, van der Hoog, Quanrud, Rotenberg, Schwiegelshohn, SODA'24]. We also can maintain an implicit fractional out-orientation with a guarantee that all out-degrees are at most $(1+\\varepsilon)ρ$. Our algorithms above work by greedily packing pseudoforests, and require maintenance of a minimum-weight pseudoforest in a dynamically changing graph. We show that this problem can be solved in $O(\\log n)$ worst-case time per edge insertion or deletion. For general matroids, we observe two characterizations of the limit of the base packings (``the vector of ideal loads''), which imply the characterizations from [Cen, Fleischmann, Li, Li, Panigrahi, FOCS'25], namely, their entropy-minimization theorem and their bottom-up cut hierarchy. Finally, we give combinatorial results on the greedy tree packings. We show that a tree packing of $O(λ^5\\log m)$ trees contains a tree crossing some min-cut once, which improves the bound $O(λ^7\\log^3 m)$ from [Thorup, Combinatorica'07]. We also strengthen the lower bound on the edge load convergence rate from [de Vos, Christiansen, SODA'25], showing that Thorup's upper bound is tight up to a logarithmic factor."

However, existing matching-based decoders for the color codes such as the restricted decoder (Kubica and Delfosse, 2023), suffer from limited decoding performance. Inspired by the global decoding insight of the unified decoder (Benhemou et al., 2023), this paper introduces a correlated decoder for the 4.8.8 color code, which improves upon the conventional restricted decoder by leveraging correlations between restricted lattices, and is derived by mapping the correlated matching decoder for the surface code onto the color code lattice. Analytical and numerical results show that the correlated decoder achieves higher thresholds than the restricted and unified decoders, while matching the performance of the unified decoder at very low physical error rates. Under the code capacity and phenomenological noise models, the estimated thresholds for the color code against bit-flip error are 10.38% and 3.13%, respectively. Furthermore, by applying the surface-color code mapping, the thresholds of 16.62% and 3.52% are obtained for the surface code against depolarizing noise."

    "abstract": "Self-play reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant success in learning complex strategic and interactive behaviors in competitive multi-agent games. However, achieving such behaviors in continuous decision spaces remains challenging. Ensuring adaptability and generalization in self-play settings is critical for achieving competitive performance in dynamic multi-agent environments. These challenges often cause methods to converge slowly or fail to converge at all to a Nash equilibrium, making agents vulnerable to strategic exploitation by unseen opponents. To address these challenges, we propose DiffFP, a fictitious play (FP) framework that estimates the best response to unseen opponents while learning a robust and multimodal behavioral policy. Specifically, we approximate the best response using a diffusion policy that leverages generative modeling to learn adaptive and diverse strategies. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed FP framework converges towards $ε$-Nash equilibria in continuous- space zero-sum games. We validate our method on complex multi-agent environments, including racing and multi-particle zero-sum games. Simulation results show that the learned policies are robust against diverse opponents and outperform baseline reinforcement learning policies. Our approach achieves up to 3$\\times$ faster convergence and 30$\\times$ higher success rates on average against RL-based baselines, demonstrating its robustness to opponent strategies and stability across training iterations"

    "abstract": "With the development of digital twins and smart manufacturing systems, there is an urgent need for real-time distortion field prediction to control defects in metal Additive Manufacturing (AM). However, numerical simulation methods suffer from high computational cost, long run-times that prevent real-time use, while conventional Machine learning (ML) models struggle to extract spatiotemporal features for long-horizon prediction and fail to decouple thermo-mechanical fields. This paper proposes a Physics-informed Neural Operator (PINO) to predict z and y-direction distortion for the future 15 s. Our method, Physics-informed Deep Operator Network-Recurrent Neural Network (PIDeepONet-RNN) employs trunk and branch network to process temperature history and encode distortion fields, respectively, enabling decoupling of thermo-mechanical responses. By incorporating the heat conduction equation as a soft constraint, the model ensures physical consistency and suppresses unphysical artifacts, thereby establishing a more physically consistent mapping between the thermal history and distortion. This is important because such a basis function, grounded in physical laws, provides a robust and interpretable foundation for predictions. The proposed models are trained and tested using datasets generated from experimentally validated Finite Element Method (FEM). Evaluation shows that the model achieves high accuracy, low error accumulation, time efficiency. The max absolute errors in the z and y-directions are as low as 0.9733 mm and 0.2049 mm, respectively. The error distribution shows high errors in the molten pool but low gradient norms in the deposited and key areas. The performance of PINO surrogate model highlights its potential for real-time long-horizon physics field prediction in controlling defects."

    "abstract": "Typically, scaling up the size of a system does not change the shape of its energy spectrum, other than making it denser. Exceptions, however, occur in the new phenomenon of non-Hermitian skin criticality, where closely competing generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) solutions for non-Hermitian state accumulation give rise to anomalously scaling complex spectra. In this work, we discover that such non-Hermitian criticality can generically emerge from stochasticity in the lattice bond orientation, a surprising phenomenon only possible in 2D or beyond. Marked by system size-dependent amplification rate, it can be physically traced to the proliferation of feedback loops arising from excess local non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) accumulation induced by structural disorder. While weak disorder weakens the amplification as intuitively anticipated, stronger disorder enigmatically strengthens the amplification almost universally, scaling distinctly from conventional critical system. By representing cascades of local excess NHSE as ensembles of effectively coupled chains, we analytically derived a critical GBZ that predicts how state amplification scales with the system size and disorder strength, highly consistent with empirical observations. Our new mechanism for disordered-facilitated amplification applies generically to structurally perturbed non-Hermitian lattices with broken reciprocity, and would likely find applications in non-Hermitian sensing through various experimentally mature meta-material platforms."

The method exploits the structural properties of QPs by representing them as bipartite graphs and learning to identify the optimal active set for efficiently warm-starting the solver. Across varying problem sizes, the GNN consistently reduces the number of solver iterations compared to cold-starting, while performance is comparable to a multilayer perceptron (MLP) baseline. Furthermore, a GNN trained on varying problem sizes generalizes effectively to unseen dimensions, demonstrating flexibility and scalability. These results highlight the potential of structure-aware learning to accelerate optimization in real-time applications such as model predictive control."

Vibrational frequency analysis confirms its kinetic stability. Electronic structure calculations reveals a HOMO-LUMO gap of 0.72 eV and pronounced aromaticity, further supported by a nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS(0)) value of -44.3 ppm in the interlayer B-B bonds. The simulated photoelectron spectrum of the B80- bilayer reproduces key experimental features, with vertical detachment energies agreeing with experimental peaks within 0.04 eV.

TCM-5CEval is designed to assess LLMs across five critical dimensions: (1) Core Knowledge (TCM-Exam), (2) Classical Literacy (TCM-LitQA), (3) Clinical Decision-making (TCM-MRCD), (4) Chinese Materia Medica (TCM-CMM), and (5) Clinical Non-pharmacological Therapy (TCM-ClinNPT).

Our findings show that while models exhibit proficiency in recalling foundational knowledge, they struggle with the interpretative complexities of classical texts. Critically, permutation-based consistency testing reveals widespread fragilities in model inference. All evaluated models, including the highest-scoring ones, displayed a substantial performance degradation when faced with varied question option ordering, indicating a pervasive sensitivity to positional bias and a lack of robust understanding. TCM-5CEval not only provides a more detailed diagnostic tool for LLM capabilities in TCM but aldso exposes fundamental weaknesses in their reasoning stability. To promote further research and standardized comparison, TCM-5CEval has been uploaded to the Medbench platform, joining its predecessor in the \"In-depth Challenge for Comprehensive TCM Abilities\" special track."

We present a data-driven deep learning framework for predicting multiple bulk observables in Au+Au collisions at RHIC energies. A single neural network is trained exclusively on experimental measurements of charged-particle pseudorapidity density distributions, transverse-momentum spectra and elliptic flow coefficients over a broad range of collision energies and centralities. The network architecture is inspired by the stages of a heavy-ion collision -- from the quark-gluon plasma to chemical and kinetic freeze-out -- and employs locally connected hidden layers and a structured input design that encode basic geometric and kinematic features of the system. We demonstrate that these physics-motivated choices significantly improve test performance compared to purely fully connected baselines. The trained model is then used to predict the above observables at collision energies not yet explored experimentaly at RHIC, and the results are validated using the energy dependence of the total charged-particle multiplicity per participant pair as well as comparisons to a CLVisc hydrodynamic calculation with TRENTo initial conditions. Our findings indicate that such physics-guided neural networks can serve as efficient surrogates to fill critical data gaps at RHIC and to support further phenomenological studies of QGP properties."

Our proposed approach models per-process energy profiles by leveraging fine-grained process-level resource metrics collected via eBPF and perf, which are synchronized with node-level energy measurements obtained from an attached power distribution unit. By statistically learning the relationship between process-level resource usage and node-level energy consumption through a regression-based model, our approach enables more fine-grained per-process energy predictions."

Our method targets short-duration ($\\lesssim 2\\,\\text{s}$) GW signals, exemplified by mergers of compact objects forming or involving an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). Such short signals are difficult to distinguish from background noise; yet their brevity makes them well-suited to machine-learning analyses with modest computational requirements. Using the data from the Einstein Telescope Mock Data Challenge as a benchmark, we demonstrate that the approach can successfully flag GW-like transients as anomalies in interferometer data of a single detector, achieving an initial detection efficiency of 23% for injected signals corresponding to IMBH-forming mergers. After introducing weak supervision, the model exhibits excellent generalisation and recovers all injected IMBH-forming mergers, independent of their total mass or signal-to-noise ratio, with a false-alarm rate due to statistical noise fluctuations of approximately 4.5 events per year for a single interferometer operating with a 100% duty cycle. The method also successfully identifies lower-mass mergers leading to the formation of black holes with mass larger than $\\simeq 20\\,M_\\odot$. Our pipeline does not yet classify anomalies, distinguishing between actual GW signals and noise artefacts; however, it highlights any deviation from the learned background noise distribution for further scrutiny.

However, when dealing with complex scenes, existing methods often struggle to strike a balance between fine-grained feature representation of inhomogeneous haze distribution and global consistency modeling. Furthermore, to better learn the common degenerate representation of haze in spatial variations, we propose an unsupervised dehaze method for implicit neural degradation representation. Firstly, inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose a mechanism combining the channel-independent and channel-dependent mechanisms, which efficiently enhances the ability to learn from nonlinear dependencies. which in turn achieves good visual perception in complex scenes. Moreover, we design an implicit neural representation to model haze degradation as a continuous function to eliminate redundant information and the dependence on explicit feature extraction and physical models. To further learn the implicit representation of the haze features, we also designed a dense residual enhancement module from it to eliminate redundant information. This achieves high-quality image restoration. Experimental results show that our method achieves competitive dehaze performance on various public and real-world datasets.

To address this issue, we propose the Distillation-guided Gradient Surgery Network (DGS-Net), a novel framework that preserves transferable pre-trained priors while suppressing task-irrelevant components. Specifically, we introduce a gradient-space decomposition that separates harmful and beneficial descent directions during optimization. By projecting task gradients onto the orthogonal complement of harmful directions and aligning with beneficial ones distilled from a frozen CLIP encoder, DGS-Net achieves unified optimization of prior preservation and irrelevant suppression.

    "abstract": "Medical image enhancement is clinically valuable, but existing methods require large-scale datasets to learn complex pixel-level mappings. However, the substantial training and storage costs associated with these datasets hinder their practical deployment. While dataset distillation (DD) can alleviate these burdens, existing methods mainly target high-level tasks, where multiple samples share the same label. This many-to-one mapping allows distilled data to capture shared semantics and achieve information compression. In contrast, low-level tasks involve a many-to-many mapping that requires pixel-level fidelity, making low-level DD an underdetermined problem, as a small distilled dataset cannot fully constrain the dense pixel-level mappings. To address this, we propose the first low-level DD method for medical image enhancement. We first leverage anatomical similarities across patients to construct the shared anatomical prior based on a representative patient, which serves as the initialization for the distilled data of different patients. This prior is then personalized for each patient using a Structure-Preserving Personalized Generation (SPG) module, which integrates patient-specific anatomical information into the distilled dataset while preserving pixel-level fidelity. For different low-level tasks, the distilled data is used to construct task-specific high- and low-quality training pairs. Patient-specific knowledge is injected into the distilled data by aligning the gradients computed from networks trained on the distilled pairs with those from the corresponding patient's raw data. Notably, downstream users cannot access raw patient data. Instead, only a distilled dataset containing abstract training information is shared, which excludes patient-specific details and thus preserves privacy."

    "abstract": "Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) will become a service in future mobile communication networks. It enables the detection and recognition of passive objects and environments using radar-like sensing. The ultimate advantage is the reuse of the mobile network and radio access resources for scene illumination, sensing, data transportation, computation, and fusion. It enables building a distributed, ubiquitous sensing network that can be adapted for a variety of radio sensing tasks and services. In this article, we develop the principles of multi-sensor ISAC (MS-ISAC). MS-ISAC corresponds to multi-user MIMO communication, which in radar terminology is known as distributed MIMO radar. \\ First, we develop basic architectural principles for MS-ISAC and link them to example use cases. We then propose a generic MS-ISAC architecture. After a brief reference to multipath propagation and multistatic target reflectivity issues, we outline multilink access, coordination, precoding and link adaptation schemes for MS-ISAC. Moreover, we review model-based estimation and tracking of delay~/~Doppler from sparse OFDMA~/~TDMA frames. We emphasize Cooperative Passive Coherent Location (CPCL) for bistatic correlation and synchronization. Finally, issues of multisensor node synchronization and distributed data fusion are addressed."

    "abstract": "Lifelong learning on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) aims to train or fine-tune a unified model sequentially on cancer-related tasks, reducing the resources and effort required for data transfer and processing, especially given the gigabyte-scale size of WSIs. In this paper, we introduce MergeSlide, a simple yet effective framework that treats lifelong learning as a model merging problem by leveraging a vision-language pathology foundation model. When a new task arrives, it is: 1) defined with class-aware prompts, 2) fine-tuned for a few epochs using an MLP-free backbone, and 3) merged into a unified model using an orthogonal continual merging strategy that preserves performance and mitigates catastrophic forgetting. For inference under the class-incremental learning (CLASS-IL) setting, where task identity is unknown, we introduce Task-to-Class Prompt-aligned (TCP) inference. Specifically, TCP first identifies the most relevant task using task-level prompts and then applies the corresponding class-aware prompts to generate predictions. To evaluate MergeSlide, we conduct experiments on a stream of six TCGA datasets. The results show that MergeSlide outperforms both rehearsal-based continual learning and vision-language zero-shot baselines.

They obey the bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC), which guarantees the emergence of boundary states with non-zero topological invariants in the bulk. A wide attention has been paid to extending topological phases to nonlinear and non-Hermitian systems. However, the BBC and topological invariants of non-Hermitian nonlinear systems remain largely unexplored. Here, we establish a complete BBC and topological characterization of the topological phases in a class of non-Hermitian nonlinear-eigenvalue systems by introducing an auxiliary system. We restore the BBC broken by non-Hermiticity via employing the generalized Brillouin zone on the auxiliary system. Remarkably, we discover that the interplay between non-Hermiticity and nonlinearity creates an exotic complex-band topological phase that coexists with the real-band topological phase. Our results enrich the family of nonlinear topological phases and lay a foundation for exploring novel topological physics in metamaterial systems."

    "abstract": "Zigzag edges of graphene have long been predicted to exhibit magnetic electronic state near the Fermi level, which can cause spin-related phenomena and offer unique potentials for graphene-based spintronics. However, the magnetic conduction channels along these edges have yet been reported experimentally. Here, we report the observation on signatures of magnetism in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (zGNRs) embedded in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The in-plane bonding with BN can stabilize the edges of zGNRs, and thus enable a direct probing of the intrinsic magnetism. Firstly, the presence of magnetism of a zGNR was confirmed by scanning NV center microscopy. And then, zGNR was fabricated into a transistor with a width of ~9 nm wide and a channel length of sub-50 nm. By performing magneto-transport measurements, Fabry-Pérot interference patterns were observed in the transistor at 4 Kelvin, which indicates a coherent transport through the channel. A large magnetoresistance of ~175 Ω, corresponding to a ratio of ~1.3 %, was observed at the same temperature. More importantly, such magneto-transport signal is highly anisotropic on the magnetic field direction, and its appearance extends well above room temperature. All these evidences corroborate the existence of robust magnetic ordering in the edge state of zGNR. The findings on zGNR embedded in h-BN provide an effective platform for the future exploration of graphene-based spintronic devices."

Existing methods rely on simplified geometric assumptions, such as independent point predictions or global planar modeling, failing to capture structural variations and aleatoric uncertainty in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose MonoUnc, a bird's-eye view (BEV)-free 3D lane detector that explicitly models aleatoric uncertainty informed by local lane structures. Specifically, 3D lanes are projected onto the front-view (FV) space and approximated by parametric curves. Guided by curve predictions, curve-point query embeddings are dynamically generated for lane point predictions in 3D space. Each segment formed by two adjacent points is modeled as a 3D Gaussian, parameterized by the local structure and uncertainty estimations. Accordingly, a novel 3D Gaussian matching loss is designed to constrain these parameters jointly. Experiments on the ONCE-3DLanes and OpenLane datasets demonstrate that MonoUnc outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods across all benchmarks under stricter evaluation criteria. Additionally, we propose two comprehensive evaluation metrics for ONCE-3DLanes, calculating the average and maximum bidirectional Chamfer distances to quantify global and local errors.

    "abstract": "Practical global path planning is critical for commercializing cleaning robots working in semi-structured environments. In the literature, global path planning methods for free space usually focus on path length and neglect the traffic rule constraints of the environments, which leads to high-frequency re-planning and increases collision risks. In contrast, those for structured environments are developed mainly by strictly complying with the road network representing the traffic rule constraints, which may result in an overlong path that hinders the overall navigation efficiency. This article proposes a general and systematic approach to improve global path planning performance in semi-structured environments. A unidirectional road network is built to represent the traffic constraints in semi-structured environments and a hybrid strategy is proposed to achieve a guaranteed planning result.Cutting across the road at the starting and the goal points are allowed to achieve a shorter path. Especially, a two-layer potential map is proposed to achieve a guaranteed performance when the starting and the goal points are in complex intersections. Comparative experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Quantitative experimental results show that, compared with the state-of-art, the proposed method guarantees a much better balance between path length and the consistency with the road network."

To address this gap, we introduce two new datasets -- BEA-Large and BEA-Dialogue -- constructed from the previously unprocessed portions of the Hungarian speech corpus named BEA. BEA-Large extends BEA-Base with 255 hours of spontaneous speech from 433 speakers, enriched with detailed segment-level metadata. BEA-Dialogue, comprising 85 hours of spontaneous conversations, is a Hungarian speech corpus featuring natural dialogues partitioned into speaker-independent subsets, supporting research in conversational ASR and speaker diarization. We establish reproducible baselines on these datasets using publicly available ASR models, with the fine-tuned Fast Conformer model achieving word error rates as low as 14.18\\% on spontaneous and 4.8\\% on repeated speech. Diarization experiments yield diarization error rates between 13.05\\% and 18.26\\%, providing reference points for future improvements. The results highlight the persistent difficulty of conversational ASR, particularly due to disfluencies, overlaps, and informal speech patterns. By releasing these datasets and baselines, we aim to advance Hungarian speech technology and offer a methodological framework for developing spontaneous and conversational benchmarks in other languages."

Among AI technologies, large language models (LLMs) have become especially impactful, enabling deep knowledge extraction and semantic reasoning from complex medical texts. However, effective clinical decision support requires knowledge in structured, interoperable formats. Knowledge graphs serve this role by integrating heterogeneous medical information into semantically consistent networks. Yet, current clinical knowledge graphs still depend heavily on manual curation and rule-based extraction, which is limited by the complexity and contextual ambiguity of medical guidelines and literature. To overcome these challenges, we propose an automated framework that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with LLMs to construct medical indicator knowledge graphs. The framework incorporates guideline-driven data acquisition, ontology-based schema design, and expert-in-the-loop validation to ensure scalability, accuracy, and clinical reliability. The resulting knowledge graphs can be integrated into intelligent diagnosis and question-answering systems, accelerating the development of AI-driven healthcare solutions."

Building on our earlier work on spatial-derivative nonlinearities, we construct and classify a five-parameter family of generalized self-similar blow-up solutions that captures the observed dynamics. We prove that no smooth exact self-similar profiles exist, while the generalized self-similar solutions -exhibiting logarithmic growth- provide the correct blow-up description inside backward light cones. We further establish asymptotic stability for the relevant branches, including the ODE-type blow-up in both models. These results yield a coherent and unified picture of blow-up mechanisms in time-derivative nonlinear wave equations."

Similar to classical machine learning, QML models also face challenges arising from the scarcity of labeled data, particularly as their scale and complexity increase. Here, we introduce self-supervised pretraining of quantum representations that reduces reliance on labeled data by learning invariances from unlabeled examples. We implement this paradigm on a programmable trapped-ion quantum computer, encoding images as quantum states. In situ contrastive pretraining on hardware yields a representation that, when fine-tuned, classifies image families with higher mean test accuracy and lower run-to-run variability than models trained from random initialization. Performance improvement is especially significant in regimes with limited labeled training data. We show that the learned invariances generalize beyond the pretraining image samples. Unlike prior work, our pipeline derives similarity from measured quantum overlaps and executes all training and classification stages on hardware. These results establish a label-efficient route to quantum representation learning, with direct relevance to quantum-native datasets and a clear path to larger classical inputs."

This paper studies a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system where both the transmitter and the receiver are equipped with multiple pixel antennas. We aim to characterize the fundamental capacity limit of this MIMO system by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance matrix and the antenna coders at both the transmitter and the receiver. This problem is a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) which is non-convex and particularly challenging to solve due to the binary-valued optimization variables corresponding to the antenna coders. We first propose an exhaustive search based method to obtain the optimal solution to this problem, which corresponds to the fundamental capacity limit. Then, we propose a branch-and-bound based iterative algorithm aiming to find a high-quality suboptimal solution with lower complexity than exhaustive search as the number of pixel ports becomes large. Finally, we devise an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm with polynomial complexity. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms achieve a flexible trade-off between performance and complexity. Moreover, equipping the transceivers with pixel antennas can enhance the achievable rate of MIMO communications."

    "abstract": "Multimedia documents such as slide presentations and posters are designed to be interactive and easy to modify. Yet, they are often distributed in a static raster format, which limits editing and customization. Restoring their editability requires converting these raster images back into structured vector formats. However, existing geometric raster-vectorization methods, which rely on low-level primitives like curves and polygons, fall short at this task. Specifically, when applied to complex documents like slides, they fail to preserve the high-level structure, resulting in a flat collection of shapes where the semantic distinction between image and text elements is lost. To overcome this limitation, we address the problem of semantic document derendering by introducing SliDer, a novel framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to derender slide images as compact and editable Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) representations. SliDer detects and extracts attributes from individual image and text elements in a raster input and organizes them into a coherent SVG format. Crucially, the model iteratively refines its predictions during inference in a process analogous to human design, generating SVG code that more faithfully reconstructs the original raster upon rendering. Furthermore, we introduce Slide2SVG, a novel dataset comprising raster-SVG pairs of slide documents curated from real-world scientific presentations, to facilitate future research in this domain. Our results demonstrate that SliDer achieves a reconstruction LPIPS of 0.069 and is favored by human evaluators in 82.9% of cases compared to the strongest zero-shot VLM baseline."

    "abstract": "Since the 21st century, artificial intelligence has been leading a new round of industrial revolution. Under the training framework, the optimization algorithm aims to stably converge high-dimensional optimization to local and even global minima. Entering the era of large language models, although the scale of model parameters and data has increased, Adam remains the mainstream optimization algorithm. However, compared with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based optimization algorithms, Adam is more likely to converge to non-flat minima. To address this issue, the AdamX algorithm is proposed. Its core innovation lies in the proposition of a novel type of second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate, which gradually weakens the learning step correction strength as training progresses, and degrades to SGD in the stable training period, thereby improving the stability of training in the stable period and possibly enhancing generalization ability. Experimental results show that our second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate is better than the current second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate, and AdamX can stably outperform Adam and its variants in terms of performance.

    "abstract": "We prove a functional inequality in any dimension controlling the derivative along a transport of the Riesz modulated energy in terms of the modulated energy itself. This modulated energy was introduced by the third author and collaborators in the study of mean-field limits and statistical mechanics of Coulomb/Riesz gases, where this control is an essential ingredient. Previous work of the last two authors and Q.H. Nguyen arXiv:2107.02592 showed a similar functional inequality but with an additive $N$-dependent error (where $N$ is the number of particles, $\\mathsf{d}$ the dimension, and $\\mathsf{s}$ the inverse power of the Riesz potential) which was not sharp. In this paper, we obtain the optimal $N^{\\frac{\\mathsf{s}}{\\mathsf{d}}-1}$ error, for all cases, including the sub-Coulomb case. Our method is conceptually simple and, like previous work, relies on the observation that the derivative along a transport of the modulated energy is the quadratic form of a commutator. Through a new potential truncation scheme based on a wavelet-type representation of the Riesz potential to handle its singularity, the proof reduces to averaging over a family of Kato-Ponce type estimates. The commutator estimate has applications to sharp rates of convergence for mean-field limits, quasi-neutral limits, and central limit theorems for the fluctuations of Coulomb/Riesz gases both at and out of thermal equilibrium. In particular, we show here for $\\mathsf{s}<\\mathsf{d}-2$ the expected $N^{\\frac{\\mathsf{s}}{\\mathsf{d}}-1}$-rate in the modulated energy distance for the mean-field convergence of first-order Hamiltonian and gradient flows. This complements the recent work arXiv:2407.15650 on the optimal rate for the (super-)Coulomb case $\\mathsf{d}-2\\le \\mathsf{s}<\\mathsf{d}$ and therefore resolves the entire potential Riesz case."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches based on Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are predominantly applied in the robot joint space, often relying on limited task-specific information and partial awareness of the 3D environment. In contrast, episodic RL has demonstrated advantages over traditional MDP-based methods in terms of trajectory consistency, task awareness, and overall performance in complex robotic tasks. Moreover, traditional step-wise and episodic RL methods often neglect the contact-rich information inherent in task-space manipulation, especially considering the contact-safety and robustness. In this work, contact-rich manipulation tasks are tackled using a task-space, energy-safe framework, where reliable and safe task-space trajectories are generated through the combination of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and movement primitives. Furthermore, an energy-aware Cartesian Impedance Controller objective is incorporated within the proposed framework to ensure safe interactions between the robot and the environment. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in handling tasks on various types of surfaces in 3D environments, achieving high success rates as well as smooth trajectories and energy-safe interactions."

    "abstract": "Right heart failure (RHF) is a disease characterized by abnormalities in the structure or function of the right ventricle (RV), which is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Lung disease often causes increased right ventricular load, leading to RHF. Therefore, it is very important to screen out patients with cor pulmonale who develop RHF from people with underlying lung diseases. In this work, we propose a self-supervised representation learning method to early detecting RHF from patients with cor pulmonale, which uses spirogram time series to predict patients with RHF at an early stage. The proposed model is divided into two stages. The first stage is the self-supervised representation learning-based spirogram embedding (SLSE) network training process, where the encoder of the Variational autoencoder (VAE-encoder) learns a robust low-dimensional representation of the spirogram time series from the data-augmented unlabeled data. Second, this low-dimensional representation is fused with demographic information and fed into a CatBoost classifier for the downstream RHF prediction task. Trained and tested on a carefully selected subset of 26,617 individuals from the UK Biobank, our model achieved an AUROC of 0.7501 in detecting RHF, demonstrating strong population-level distinction ability. We further evaluated the model on high-risk clinical subgroups, achieving AUROC values of 0.8194 on a test set of 74 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 0.8413 on a set of 64 patients with valvular heart disease (VHD). These results highlight the model's potential utility in predicting RHF among clinically elevated-risk populations. In conclusion, this study presents a self-supervised representation learning approach combining spirogram time series and demographic data, demonstrating promising potential for early RHF detection in clinical practice."

In a BAM, each alternative has a subset of Boolean attributes, each voter cares about a subset of attributes, and voters prefer alternatives with more of their desired attributes. In the BAM problem, we are given a preference profile and a number k, and want to know whether there is a Boolean k-attribute model explaining the profile. We establish a complexity dichotomy for the number of attributes k: BAM is linear-time solvable for $k \\le 2$ but NP-complete for $k \\ge 3$. The problem remains hard even when preference orders have length two. On the positive side, BAM becomes fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the number of alternatives m. For the special case of two voters, we provide a linear-time algorithm. We also analyze variants where partial information is given: When voter preferences over attributes are known (BAM WITH CARES) or when alternative attributes are specified (BAM WITH HAS), we show that for most parameters BAM WITH CARES is more difficult whereas BAM WITH HAS is more tractable except for being NP-hard even for one voter."

A lightweight attentive fusion gate adaptively determines the contribution of each stream to the final prediction.

To address these gaps, we present PAL-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the personalization capabilities of service-oriented assistants in long-term user-agent interactions. In the absence of available real-world data, we develop a multi-step LLM-based synthesis pipeline, which is further verified and refined by human annotators. This process yields PAL-Set, the first Chinese dataset comprising multi-session user logs and dialogue histories, which serves as the foundation for PAL-Bench. Furthermore, to improve personalized service-oriented interactions, we propose H$^2$Memory, a hierarchical and heterogeneous memory framework that incorporates retrieval-augmented generation to improve personalized response generation. Comprehensive experiments on both our PAL-Bench and an external dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed memory framework."

This transformation reformulates the original eigenvalue problem as a generalized eigenvalue problem, enabling fault-oblivious computation while preserving numerical stability and convergence properties. We formulate the augmentation scheme, establish the necessary conditions for the encoded blocks, and prove the relationship between the original and transformed problems. We implement an erasure-coded TraceMin eigensolver and demonstrate its effectiveness in extracting eigenvalues in the presence of faults. Our experimental results show that the proposed solver incurs minimal computational overhead, maintains robust convergence, and scales efficiently with the number of faults, making it a practical solution for resilient eigenvalue computations in large-scale systems."

Building on the kNN statistics, we introduce a new field-level representation of discrete halo catalogues - NN distance maps. We employ this technique on the halo catalogues obtained from Quijote N-body simulation suites. By combining these maps with kNN-based summary statistics, we train a hybrid neural network to infer cosmological parameters, showing that the resulting constraints achieve state-of-the-art, if not the best, accuracy.

However, for 0{\\textdegree}/90{\\textdegree} biaxial NCFs (Biax-NCF) with a symmetrical stitching pattern and high stitch pretension, deviations from a pure-shear assumption in coupon tests are only observed at higher shear angles due to limited roving slippage.

We developed PEDIASBench, a systematic evaluation framework centered on a knowledge-system framework and tailored to realistic clinical environments. PEDIASBench assesses LLMs across three dimensions: application of basic knowledge, dynamic diagnosis and treatment capability, and pediatric medical safety and medical ethics. We evaluated 12 representative models released over the past two years, including GPT-4o, Qwen3-235B-A22B, and DeepSeek-V3, covering 19 pediatric subspecialties and 211 prototypical diseases. State-of-the-art models performed well on foundational knowledge, with Qwen3-235B-A22B achieving over 90% accuracy on licensing-level questions, but performance declined ~15% as task complexity increased, revealing limitations in complex reasoning. Multiple-choice assessments highlighted weaknesses in integrative reasoning and knowledge recall. In dynamic diagnosis and treatment scenarios, DeepSeek-R1 scored highest in case reasoning (mean 0.58), yet most models struggled to adapt to real-time patient changes. On pediatric medical ethics and safety tasks, Qwen2.5-72B performed best (accuracy 92.05%), though humanistic sensitivity remained limited. These findings indicate that pediatric LLMs are constrained by limited dynamic decision-making and underdeveloped humanistic care. Future development should focus on multimodal integration and a clinical feedback-model iteration loop to enhance safety, interpretability, and human-AI collaboration. While current LLMs cannot independently perform pediatric care, they hold promise for decision support, medical education, and patient communication, laying the groundwork for a safe, trustworthy, and collaborative intelligent pediatric healthcare system."

This task leverages a multi-dialect, manually curated dataset derived from hotel reviews originally written in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and translated into Saudi and Moroccan (Darija) dialects. The dataset consists of 538 sentiment-balanced reviews spanning positive, neutral, and negative categories. Translations were validated by native speakers to ensure dialectal accuracy and sentiment preservation. This resource supports the development of dialect-aware NLP systems for real-world applications in customer experience analysis. More than 40 teams have registered for the shared task, with 12 submitting systems during the evaluation phase. The top-performing system achieved an F1 score of 0.81, demonstrating the feasibility and ongoing challenges of sentiment analysis across Arabic dialects."

    "abstract": "Phase space trajectories are fundamentally important for understanding and analysing chaotic attractors. This is mostly carried out by direct numerical solution of the dynamical equations. Though the origin of scrolls can be understood from the properties of dynamical equations, their appearance in the phase space can also be inferred from the geometry and relative orientations of Nambu surfaces, drawn using Nambu Hamiltonians than from direct numerical solutions. Therefore, one can attribute the origin of wings in the phase space due to energy like Nambu surfaces, giving a geometrical interpretation. In this article, we have carried out, both numerical analysis of bifurcation diagram and Lyapunov exponents(LEs) to characterise chaos and geometric approach by applying the Nambu generalized Hamiltonian mechanics to explain the fundamental reason for the appearance of wings like geometry in the phase space. We have shown how a fixed number of scrolls or wings can appear in the phase space due to specific geometry of the Nambu surfaces and how different geometries are formed when set of parameters are changed."

Drawing on international examples, such as London Heathrow, it discusses how large hubs combine high traffic generation with severe physical constraints, highlighting how saturation intensifies delays, operating costs, and pressures for expansion. It analyzes capacity scarcity as a central economic problem, in which runways, aprons, boarding gates, and terminals become critical resources whose use requires administrative and market mechanisms, including slot coordination, prioritization rules, and regulatory incentives. It discusses the limitations imposed by high earthmoving costs, environmental impacts, and expropriation costs, which restrict the physical expansion of central airports such as Congonhas and increase dependence on efficiency gains. Demand projections indicate that the combined capacity of Congonhas, Guarulhos, and Viracopos is likely to be exceeded, even in conservative scenarios, reinforcing the urgency of integrated planning. The effects of regulatory restrictions on Congonhas, the challenges of expanding Guarulhos, and the structural difficulties of Viracopos are evaluated, highlighting the strategic relevance of this multi-airport system for sustaining national connectivity."

    "abstract": "Enterprise applications are typically tested at multiple levels, with service-level testing playing an important role in validating application functionality. Existing service-level testing tools, especially for RESTful APIs, often employ fuzzing and/or depend on OpenAPI specifications which are not readily available in real-world enterprise codebases. Moreover, these tools are limited in their ability to generate functional tests that effectively exercise meaningful scenarios. In this work, we present SAINT, a novel white-box testing approach for service-level testing of enterprise Java applications. SAINT combines static analysis, large language models (LLMs), and LLM-based agents to automatically generate endpoint and scenario-based tests. The approach builds two key models: an endpoint model, capturing syntactic and semantic information about service endpoints, and an operation dependency graph, capturing inter-endpoint ordering constraints. SAINT then employs LLM-based agents to generate tests. Endpoint-focused tests aim to maximize code and database interaction coverage. Scenario-based tests are synthesized by extracting application use cases from code and refining them into executable tests via planning, action, and reflection phases of the agentic loop. We evaluated SAINT on eight Java applications, including a proprietary enterprise application. Our results illustrate the effectiveness of SAINT in coverage, fault detection, and scenario generation. Moreover, a developer survey provides strong endorsement of the scenario-based tests generated by SAINT. Overall, our work shows that combining static analysis with agentic LLM workflows enables more effective, functional, and developer-aligned service-level test generation."

The deep commuting graph $Δ_D(G)$ of $G$ is a simple graph with vertex set $G$, where two distinct vertices are adjacent if their pre-images commute in $\\tilde{G}$. The deep commuting graph of a finite group was first introduced in [P. J. Cameron and B. Kuzma, Between the enhanced power graph and the commuting graph, {\\it J.

In this paper, we first prove that $Δ_D(G)$ is complete if and only if $G$ is cyclic. Also, we classify finite simple groups, symmetric groups and alternating groups, for which $Δ_D(G)$ is perfect. In addition, explore several other properties of $Δ_D(G)$ like Eulerianess, universality and connectedness of reduced deep commuting graphs. Next, we classify the finite abelian groups for which deep commuting graphs coincide with enhance power graphs. We also characterize the dominant vertices for the deep commuting graphs of finite abelian groups and examine the connectedness of the associated reduced deep commuting graphs. These properties of the deep commuting graphs for the non abelian groups like symmetric groups, alternating groups, dihedral groups, generalized quaternion group and Heisenberg groups are also discussed."

We introduce 'bosonisation cohomology' groups $H_B^{d+2}(X)$ to capture this difference, for theories in spacetime dimension $d$ equipped with maps to some $X$. Non-trivial classes in $H_B^{d+2}(X)$ contain theories for which $(-1)^F$ is anomaly-free, but spin structure summation is anomalous. We formulate a sequence of cobordism groups whose failure to be exact is measured by $H_B^{d+2}(X)$, and from here we compute it for $X=\\text{pt}$. The result is non-trivial only in dimensions $d\\in 4\\mathbb{Z}+2$, being due to the presence of gravitational anomalies. The first few are $H_B^4=\\mathbb{Z}_2$, probed by a theory of 8 Majorana-Weyl fermions in $d=2$, then $H_B^8=\\mathbb{Z}_8$, $H_B^{12}=\\mathbb{Z}_{16}\\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$. We rigorously derive a general formula extending this to every spacetime dimension. Along the way, we compile many general facts about (fermionic and bosonic) anomaly polynomials, and about spin and pin$^-$ (co)bordism generators, that we hope might serve as a useful reference for physicists working with these objects. We briefly discuss some physics applications, including how the $H_B^{12}$ class is trivialised in supergravity. Despite the name, and notation, we make no claim that $H_B^\\bullet(X)$ actually defines a cohomology theory (in the Eilenberg-Steenrod sense)."

Spontaneously oriented organic thin films prepared by physical vapor deposition offer a promising poling-free and scalable approach. This study investigates molecular engineering strategies to enhance the second-order nonlinear response of derivatives based on the donor-acceptor molecule 2-(4'-diphenylaminobiphenyl-4-yl)quinoxaline-6,7-dicarbonitrile (TPA-QCN). Four derivatives incorporating modifications designed to increase molecular hyperpolarizability ($β$) or promote favorable orientation were synthesized and characterized. The most successful modification, intramolecular bridge-locking, simultaneously increases hyperpolarizability and enhances spontaneous orientation by reducing detrimental electrostatic interactions during deposition. It leads to a significant enhancement of the second-order nonlinear response, achieving off-resonance $χ^{(2)}_{31} \\approx 16$ pm V$^{-1}$ and $χ^{(2)}_{33} \\approx 18$ pm V$^{-1}$ at 1550 nm, a twofold improvement over the parent TPA-QCN. Analysis combining nonlinear optical measurements, surface potential measurement, optical anisotropy, and density functional theory calculations indicates that improved molecular orientation, rather than increased $β$ alone, is the primary driver for the enhanced performance in the leading derivatives. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of targeting molecular orientation via structural design and position spontaneously oriented organic films as compelling poling-free candidates for integrated nonlinear photonic applications where the increased electrode-induced optical losses, fabrication complexity and footprint are a critical limitation."

A fused MSDeformAttn engine executes interpolation, Softmax, aggregation, and the final projection (W''m) in one pass without spilling intermediates, while small tensors are kept on-chip and surrounding dense layers run on integrated GEMMs. Implemented as RTL and evaluated end-to-end, QUILL achieves up to 7.29x higher throughput and 47.3x better energy efficiency than an RTX 4090, and exceeds prior accelerators by 3.26-9.82x in throughput and 2.01-6.07x in energy efficiency. With mixed-precision quantization, accuracy tracks FP32 within <=0.9 AP across Deformable and Sparse DETR variants.

    "abstract": "We present an open-shell frozen natural orbital (FNO) approach, which utilizes the second-order Z-averaged perturbation theory (ZAPT2), to reduce the restricted opten-shell Hartree-Fock virtual space size with controllable accuracy. Our ZAPT2 frozen natural orbital (ZAPT-FNO) selection scheme significantly outperforms the canonical molecular orbital virtual space truncation scheme based on Hartree-Fock orbital energies, especially when using large multiple-polarized and augmented basis sets. We demonstrate that the ZAPT-FNO-selected virtual orbitals lead to a systematic convergence of the correlation energies, but more importantly to the singlet-triplet T$_1$-S$_ 0$ energy gaps with respect to the complete active space (CAS) [occupied + virtual] size. We confirm our findings by simulating T$_1$-S$_ 0$ gaps in H$_2$O$_2$ and O$_2$ molecules using the traditional complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI) approach, as well as in stretched CH$_2$, for which we also employed the iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) method as a quantum eigensolver. Finally, we applied the iQCC method with ZAPT-FNO-selected active space to the phosphorescent Ir(ppy)$_3$ complex with 260 electrons, where extended basis sets are required to achieve chemical (ca. 1 m$E_h$) accuracy. In this case, CASCI results are not available; however, the iQCC-computed T$_1$-S$_ 0$ gaps show robust convergence with enlarging basis set and CAS size, approaching the experimental value. Thus, the ZAPT-FNO method is very promising for improving the accuracy of quantum chemical modelling in a resource-efficient manner, and opens the door to simulating open-shell states of large materials within realistic active space sizes and without compromising on basis-set quality."

Based on this formulation, we develop a unified framework that unifies LLM-based generation with syntactic and semantic validation and a quantitative cost-guided feedback mechanism. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework not only matches the quality of handcrafted transformers, but more importantly, discovers sound, high-precision transformers for complex nonlinear operators that are absent from existing literature."

To bridge this gap, we introduce PhysX-Anything, the first simulation-ready physical 3D generative framework that, given a single in-the-wild image, produces high-quality sim-ready 3D assets with explicit geometry, articulation, and physical attributes. Specifically, we propose the first VLM-based physical 3D generative model, along with a new 3D representation that efficiently tokenizes geometry. It reduces the number of tokens by 193x, enabling explicit geometry learning within standard VLM token budgets without introducing any special tokens during fine-tuning and significantly improving generative quality. In addition, to overcome the limited diversity of existing physical 3D datasets, we construct a new dataset, PhysX-Mobility, which expands the object categories in prior physical 3D datasets by over 2x and includes more than 2K common real-world objects with rich physical annotations. Extensive experiments on PhysX-Mobility and in-the-wild images demonstrate that PhysX-Anything delivers strong generative performance and robust generalization. Furthermore, simulation-based experiments in a MuJoCo-style environment validate that our sim-ready assets can be directly used for contact-rich robotic policy learning.

In recent years, a number of LLM agents have been proposed to solve real-world software problems. Such software agents are typically equipped with a suite of coding tools and can autonomously decide the next actions to form complete trajectories to solve end-to-end software tasks. While promising, they typically require dedicated design and may still be suboptimal, since it can be extremely challenging and costly to exhaust the entire agent scaffold design space. Recognizing that software agents are inherently software themselves that can be further refined/modified, researchers have proposed a number of self-improving software agents recently, including the Darwin-Gödel Machine (DGM). Meanwhile, such self-improving agents require costly offline training on specific benchmarks and may not generalize well across different LLMs or benchmarks. In this paper, we propose Live-SWE-agent, the first live software agent that can autonomously and continuously evolve itself on-the-fly during runtime when solving real-world software problems. More specifically, Live-SWE-agent starts with the most basic agent scaffold with only access to bash tools (e.g., mini-SWE-agent), and autonomously evolves its own scaffold implementation while solving real-world software problems. Our evaluation on the widely studied SWE-bench Verified benchmark shows that Live-SWE-agent can achieve an impressive solve rate of 75.4% without test-time scaling, outperforming all existing open-source software agents and approaching the performance of the best proprietary solution. Moreover, Live-SWE-agent outperforms state-of-the-art manually crafted software agents on the recent SWE-Bench Pro benchmark, achieving the best-known solve rate of 45.8%."

In both settings, we identify algorithms that achieve the recently introduced game-theoretic optimality notion for algorithms known as subgame perfection. Subgame perfect algorithms meet a more stringent requirement than just minimax optimality. Not only must they provide optimal uniform guarantees on the entire problem class, but also on any subclass determined by information revealed during the execution of the algorithm. In the setting of nonsmooth convex optimization with a subgradient oracle, we show that the Kelley cutting plane-Like Method due to Drori and Teboulle [1] is subgame perfect. For nonsmooth convex optimization with a proximal operator oracle, we develop a new algorithm, the Subgame Perfect Proximal Point Algorithm, and establish that it is subgame perfect. Both of these methods solve a history-aware second-order cone program within each iteration, independent of the ambient problem dimension, to plan their next steps. This yields performance guarantees that are never worse than the minimax optimal guarantees and often substantially better."

A recurrent neural model trained on these data was used to predict whether a child would record an abnormal serum creatinine value within the following thirty days. Framed as a pilot study, this work provides an initial demonstration that simple temporal representations can capture useful patterns in routine paediatric data and lays the groundwork for future multimodal extensions using additional clinical signals and more detailed renal outcomes."

For the case of sub-GeV DM and DP, these PM states may lie in the $\\sim 1-10$ TeV range and be potentially accessible at the HL-LHC as well as at other future lepton and hadron colliders. In perhaps the simplest scenario of this kind, PM consists of just a pair of electrically charged, iso- and color-singlet, vector-like (VL) fermions having opposite dark charges, with an $O(1)$ mass splitting, yielding a finite value for the strength of the KM, \\ie, $ε\\sim a~ few \\times10^{-4}$. The dark Higgs induced mixing of PM states with their SM analogs allows for their decay but can also lead to significant distortions in the expected production properties for the PM at future lepton colliders due to $t$-channel dark Higgs exchange, potentially confusing PM identification. We show that the large set of clean observables available at lepton colliders is more that sufficient to resolve any of these ambiguities. The possibility of the production of like-sign PM fields via $t/u$-channel exchange of the same dark Higgs is also briefly explored."

    "abstract": "The random nature of spontaneous emission leads to unavoidable fluctuations in a laser's output. This is often included through random Langevin forces in laser rate equations, but this approach falls short for nanolasers. In this paper, we show that the laser quantum noise can be quantitatively computed for a very broad class of lasers by starting from simple and intuitive rate equations and merely assuming that the number of photons and excited electrons only takes discrete values. The success of the model is explained by showing that it constitutes a Markov chain, which can be derived from the full master equations. We show that in the many-photon limit, the model simplifies to Langevin equations. We perform an extensive comparison of different approaches for computing quantum noise in lasers, identifying the best approach for different system sizes, ranging from nanolasers to macroscopic lasers, and different levels of excitation, i.e., cavity photon number. In particular, we find that the numerical solution to the Langevin equations is inaccurate below the laser threshold, while the laser Markov chain model, on the other hand, is accurate for all pump values and laser sizes when collective emitter effects are excluded."

We present Tissue-Aware Nuclei Detection (TAND), a novel framework achieving joint nuclei detection and classification using point-level supervision enhanced by tissue mask conditioning. TAND couples a ConvNeXt-based encoder-decoder with a frozen Virchow-2 tissue segmentation branch, where semantic tissue probabilities selectively modulate the classification stream through a novel multi-scale Spatial Feature-wise Linear Modulation (Spatial-FiLM). On the PUMA benchmark, TAND achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing both tissue-agnostic baselines and mask-supervised methods. Notably, our approach demonstrates remarkable improvements in tissue-dependent cell types such as epithelium, endothelium, and stroma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to condition per-cell classification on learned tissue masks, offering a practical pathway to reduce annotation burden."

The importer subsystem facilitates in-place import using containerized preprocessing and metadata enrichment via forms, while the analyzer subsystem coordinates and tracks containerized analyses on high-performance computing systems via the BIOMERO Python library. All imports and analyses are recorded with parameters, versions, and results, ensuring real-time provenance accessible through integrated dashboards. This dual approach places OMERO at the heart of the bioimaging analysis process: the importer ensures provenance from image acquisition through preprocessing and import into OMERO, while the analyzer records it for downstream processing. These integrated layers enhance OMEROs FAIRification, supporting traceable, reusable workflows for image analysis that bridge the gap between data import, analysis, and sharing."

    "abstract": "Deformable templates, or atlases, are images that represent a prototypical anatomy for a population, and are often enhanced with probabilistic anatomical label maps. They are commonly used in medical image analysis for population studies and computational anatomy tasks such as registration and segmentation. Because developing a template is a computationally expensive process, relatively few templates are available. As a result, analysis is often conducted with sub-optimal templates that are not truly representative of the study population, especially when there are large variations within this population. We propose a machine learning framework that uses convolutional registration neural networks to efficiently learn a function that outputs templates conditioned on subject-specific attributes, such as age and sex. We also leverage segmentations, when available, to produce anatomical segmentation maps for the resulting templates. The learned network can also be used to register subject images to the templates. We demonstrate our method on a compilation of 3D brain MRI datasets, and show that it can learn high-quality templates that are representative of populations. We find that annotated conditional templates enable better registration than their unlabeled unconditional counterparts, and outperform other templates construction methods."

This paper revisits variance-stabilizing transformations (VSTs) as a preprocessing tool by introducing a novel parametrization of the asinh transformation, systematically analyzing parameter sensitivity and calibration window size, and explicitly testing performance under volatile market regimes. Using data from Germany, Spain, and France over 2015-2024 with two model classes (NARX and LEAR), we show that VSTs substantially reduce forecast errors, with gains of up to 14.6% for LEAR and 8.7% for NARX relative to untransformed benchmarks. The new parametrized asinh consistently outperforms its standard form, while rolling averaging across transformations delivers the most robust improvements, reducing errors by up to 17.7%. Results demonstrate that VSTs are especially valuable in volatile regimes, making them a powerful tool for enhancing electricity price forecasting in today's power markets."

The main results include an explicit limit kernel for unital maps, a Stein-type decomposition, a Radon-Nikodym representation under subunitality, and an almost-sure growth law for random compositions. The construction keeps all iterates in one space, making their comparison and asymptotic analysis transparent."

We apply this framework to Kolmogorov vector fields, showing that generically the coordinate axes are the unique invariant algebraic curves. Finally, we also refine existing characterizations related to Hilbert's 16th problem, showing that if there exists a bound for the number of limit cycles of a vector field of degree n, then it can be attained by a vector field without algebraic limit cycles."

In this setting, perfect tracking or rejection is achieved by constructing a zero-regulation-error manifold π(w) and a feedforward input c(w) that render such manifold invariant. The pair (π(w), c(w)) is characterized by the regulator equations, i.e., a system of PDEs with an algebraic constraint. We focus on accurately solving the regulator equations introducing a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach that directly approximates π(w) and c(w) by minimizing the residuals under boundary and feasibility conditions, without requiring precomputed trajectories or labeled data. The learned operator maps exosystem states to steady state plant states and inputs, enables real-time inference and, critically, generalizes across families of the exosystem with varying initial conditions and parameters. The framework is validated on a regulation task that synchronizes a helicopter's vertical dynamics with a harmonically oscillating platform. The resulting PINN-based solver reconstructs the zero-error manifold with high fidelity and sustains regulation performance under exosystem variations, highlighting the potential of learning-enabled solvers for nonlinear output regulation. The proposed approach is broadly applicable to nonlinear systems that admit a solution to the output regulation problem."

Empirical results show our approach consistently ranks among the top three across a suite of competing algorithms.

We detect broadened HeII $λ$1640 and $λ$4687 (FWHM$\\sim530$ km s$^{-1}$) and strong NIII] $λ$4642 emission consistent with a population of WN stars, making RXCJ2248 the most distant galaxy with confirmed WR features to date. We measure the multi-phase nebular density across five ions, the direct-method metallicity ($12+\\log(\\rm O/H)= 7.749\\pm0.023$), and a non-uniform elemental enrichment pattern of extreme N/O enhancement ($\\log(\\rm N/O)=-0.390\\pm0.035$ from N$^+$, N$^{+2}$, and N$^{+3}$) and suppressed C/O relative to empirical C/N trends. We show that this abundance pattern can be explained by enrichment from a dual-burst with a low WC/WN ratio, as expected at low metallicities. Crucially, these signatures can only arise during a brief, rare evolutionary window shortly after a burst ($\\sim3-6$ Myr), when WN stars dominate chemical feedback but before dilution by later yields (e.g., supernovae). The observed frequency of strong N emitters at high$-z$ implies a $\\sim50$ Myr burst duty cycle, suggesting that N/O outliers may represent a brief but ubiquitous phase in the evolution of highly star-forming early galaxies. The detection in RXCJ2248, therefore, provides the first direct evidence of WN-driven chemical enrichment in the early Universe and a novel timing argument for the bursty star formation cycles that shaped galaxies at cosmic dawn."

Accurate and efficient scoring functions are necessary to distinguish between native and non-native docking models to ensure the accuracy of a docking tool. Like in other fields where deep learning methods have been successfully utilized, these methods have also introduced innovative scoring functions. An outstanding tool for scoring and differentiating native-like docking models from non-native or incorrect conformations is called Protein binding Interfaces with Transformer Networks (PIsToN). PIsToN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art scoring functions.

    "abstract": "We apply the methodology of our recent paper 'The Dynamics of the Hubbard Model through Stochastic Calculus and Girsanov Transformation' [1] to thermodynamic correlation functions in the Fermi-Hubbard model. They can be obtained from a stochastic differential equation (SDE) system. To this SDE system, a Girsanov transformation can be applied. This has the effect that the usual determinant or pfaffian which shows up in a pfaffian quantum Monte Carlo (PfQMC) representation [2] basically gets absorbed into the new integration variables and information from that pfaffian moves into the drift part of the transformed SDE system. While the PfQMC representation depends heavily on the choice of how the quartic interaction has been factorized into quadratic quantities in the beginning, the Girsanov transformed formula has the very remarkable property that it is nearly independent of that choice, the drift part of the transformed SDE system as well as a remaining exponential which has the obvious meaning of energy are always the same and do not depend on the Hubbard-Stratonovich details. The resulting formula may serve as a starting point for further theoretical or numerical investigations. Here we consider the spin-spin correlation at half-filling on a bipartite lattice and obtain an analytical proof that the signs of these correlations have to be of antiferromagnetic type, at arbitrary temperatures. Also, by checking against available benchmark data [3], we find that approximate ground state energies can be obtained from an ODE system. This may even hold for exact ground state energies, but future work would be required to prove or disprove this. As in [1], the methodology is generic and can be applied to arbitrary quantum many body or quantum field theoretical models."

    "abstract": "The direction and magnitude of energy transfer between turbulence scale brought about by external forcing on a turbulent boundary layer are uncovered through the bispectrum, bicoherence, and biphase. The bispectrum is a third-order, complex-valued spectrum of the streamwise velocity that preserves the phase information between triadically consistent scales. Normalized bispectrum is the bicoherence, a measure of the relative amount of energy at a higher frequency that results from quadratic phase coupling of two lower frequencies. The phase of the bispectrum, the biphase, measures the phase lag between the high frequency and two lower frequencies that add to it, unveiling whether a triadic interaction produces a forward or reverse cascade of energy. Summing the bispectrum over triadically consistent frequencies allows a spectral decomposition of the velocity skewness and asymmetry, unveiling the triadically active scales in the energy transfer processes. An average sense of energy transfer is inferred from the phase of this skewness spectrum, which shows that scales smaller than the boundary layer thickness contribute to a forward cascade on average, while those larger than the boundary layer thickness have a mix of forward and reverse events. These measures show that the forced scales in the perturbed boundary layer have a mixture of forward and reverse energy transfer processes for different sets of triadic scales and wall-normal locations, providing a method of quantifying the effects of external perturbations on turbulent flows without any need for artificial filtering."

Based on delayed rupture experiments, we show that the network lifetime tntw, taken as the incubation time for delayed rupture, depends on temperature in an Arrhenius like manner and is exponentially sensitive to the degree of network stretching (depicted by step-stretch ratio ). Rupture during continuous stretching for a wide range of stretch rates takes place on timescales inversely proportional to the stretch rate. The elapsed time at rupture is found to be comparable to at various values of L/L0b = L/L0ss in a wide range of temperature, affording the experimental basis for the premise of the KTBD. Having identified the hidden internal clock , continuous stretching tests at different temperatures are performed to show the existence of a new time temperature equivalence (TTE): fast stretching at higher temperatures is equivalent to slow stretching at lower temperatures: different pairs of rate and temperature can produce the rupture at the same tensile strength and strain."

This is done syntactically via an algorithm that uses the axioms of $A$ and $B$ in a recursive manner to produce those of $A \\otimes B$. We provide examples of known structures that are recovered by our construction, such as tensor products of Lawvere theories, \"cellular\" products of dependent type signatures, and theories of diagrams and of displayed structures. It will be verified in the second volume that, as suggested by these special cases, the category of family-valued models $\\text{Mod}(A \\otimes B,\\text{Fam})$ is isomorphic to $\\text{Mod}(A,\\textbf{Mod}(B))$ and to $\\text{Mod}(B,\\textbf{Mod}(A))$ for certain contextual categories $\\textbf{Mod}(A)$ and $\\textbf{Mod}(B)$ whose underlying categories are equivalent to $\\text{Mod}(A,\\text{Fam})$ and to $\\text{Mod}(B,\\text{Fam})$, respectively.

    "abstract": "The innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) offers a fundamental test of spacetime structure. However, its behavior in higher-dimensional black holes influenced by anisotropic energy-momentum tensors remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we investigate the upper bound of the ISCO in higher-dimensional, static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes in the presence of an anisotropic energy-momentum tensor. The energy-momentum tensor is assumed to satisfy the weak energy condition, possess a non-positive trace, and obey constraints on radial and tangential pressures, collectively equivalent to the dominant energy condition with additional constraints. By analyzing the effective potential for timelike geodesics and imposing ISCO conditions, we demonstrate the general absence of an upper bound on the ISCO radius in higher-dimensional spacetimes. For dimensions greater than or equal to eight, an ISCO may not exist, depending on the radial and tangential components of the energy-momentum tensor. If an ISCO exists, its radius remains unbounded. These findings advance our understanding of orbital stability in higher-dimensional gravitational systems and highlight fundamental differences from four-dimensional black hole dynamics."

    "abstract": "The Standard Model (SM) cannot explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU), thus driving the need for physics beyond the SM, which can generate electroweak baryogenesis through a strong first-order electroweak phase transition (SFOPT). We extend the SM with a complex singlet scalar (cxSM) and examine the phase transition behavior using a fully general renormalizable scalar potential that permits a complex vacuum expectation value for the singlet and coupled dynamics among multiple scalar fields. Employing the one-loop thermal effective potential with daisy resummation and appropriate counter terms, we conduct an extensive scan of the parameter space, enforcing both theoretical and experimental limits on the scalar sector. This analysis reveals viable domains yielding SFOPT. From these regions, we select representative benchmark scenarios demonstrating multi-stage transitions, producing stochastic gravitational wave signals via bubble nucleation dynamics. The resulting spectra lie within the projected sensitivity of next-generation observatories, including LISA, BBO, DECIGO, and U-DECIGO. Thus, the cxSM offers a compelling setting for electroweak baryogenesis, enriched by correlated gravitational-wave and collider phenomenology."

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning over graph-structured data, yet recent studies have shown that their performance gains are beginning to plateau. In many cases, well-established models such as GCN and GAT, when appropriately tuned, can match or even exceed the performance of more complex, state-of-the-art architectures. This trend highlights a key limitation in the current landscape: the difficulty of selecting the most suitable model for a given graph task or dataset. To address this, we propose Self-Adaptive Graph Mixture of Models (SAGMM), a modular and practical framework that learns to automatically select and combine the most appropriate GNN models from a diverse pool of architectures. Unlike prior mixture-of-experts approaches that rely on variations of a single base model, SAGMM leverages architectural diversity and a topology-aware attention gating mechanism to adaptively assign experts to each node based on the structure of the input graph. To improve efficiency, SAGMM includes a pruning mechanism that reduces the number of active experts during training and inference without compromising performance. We also explore a training-efficient variant in which expert models are pretrained and frozen, and only the gating and task-specific layers are trained. We evaluate SAGMM on 16 benchmark datasets covering node classification, graph classification, regression, and link prediction tasks, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms or matches leading GNN baselines and prior mixture-based methods, offering a robust and adaptive solution for real-world graph learning."

Using the black hole perturbation theory surrogate model \\textsc{BHPTNRSur1dq1e4} as a reference, we assess the performance of the \\textsc{IMRPhenomX} phenomenological family in the high-mass-ratio regime. We find that the inclusion of higher-order gravitational wave modes is critical; their exclusion may degrade the signal-to-noise ratio by factors of $\\sim3-5$ relative to quadrupole-only templates. With optimal mode inclusion, SSM-IMRIs are observable out to luminosity distances of $\\sim575$ Mpc ($z\\sim0.12$) with Advanced LIGO and $\\sim10.5$ Gpc ($z\\sim1.4$) with the Einstein Telescope. However, we identify substantial systematic uncertainties in current phenomenological approximants. Matches between \\textsc{IMRPhenomX} and the reference surrogate model \\textsc{BHPTNRSur1dq1e4} degrade to values as low as 0.2 for edge-on inclinations, and fitting factors consistently fall below 0.9, indicating a significant loss of effectualness in template-bank searches. Bayesian parameter estimation reveals that these modeling discrepancies induce systematic biases that exceed statistical errors by multiple standard deviations, underscoring the necessity for waveform models calibrated to perturbation theory in the intermediate mass-ratio regime for robust detection and inference."

Our findings reveal diverse and often incomplete mental models of how memory operates. While users appreciate the potential for enhanced personalization and efficiency, significant concerns exist regarding privacy, control and the accuracy of remembered information.

This situation has raised concerns in various sectors, leading to the need for strategies that promote digital transformation, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In this context, an intelligent assistance prototype was developed as a preliminary solution aimed at facilitating the gradual integration of $\\mathbf{I 4 . 0}$ technologies into SMEs, taking into account their specific context and the needs identified through a diagnostic survey. The developed prototype includes three key modules that address the requirements established by the development team and are designed to analyze the technological situation of each company in order to generate personalized diagnostics and recommendations. During the functional evaluation phase, the Llama 3.2 model with Q8 (3B) was integrated. The results obtained were: 74.3 % similarity between the generated diagnosis and the one validated by experts, and the same 74.3 % correspondence for the roadmap. These results show that the system performs acceptably, especially considering it uses an open and lightweight model. With the rapid emergence of new models, the prototype offers the flexibility to choose the model, adjust query parameters, and conduct iterative testing to improve results."

We identify key insights into the sector's growth and future potential by analyzing 30,196 patents from the Google Patents database (2008-2023) and applying machine learning techniques. Patents were retrieved using International Patent Classification (IPC) codes specific to energy utilization and recovery, then de-duplicated and screened by the main patent office. Patent quality was estimated by backward-citation impact. The findings show that the energy recovery field is expanding, with a lifecycle coefficient expected to reach maturity by 2025. Additionally, the results indicate that technological development accelerated after the 2015 Paris Agreement, peaking in 2016 and 2020. However, notable disparities exist across technological subfields, with uneven distribution, highlighting the need for increased collaboration and cross-disciplinary innovation. The “drum-type steam boilers” sector emerges as a key area for future growth, with high potential for cross-technology applications, but receives disproportionately low funding. A Convolutional Neural Network model trained with the Adam optimizer achieved 73.6% accuracy in predicting patent citation trends, demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning in identifying high-quality patents and automating large-scale quality assessments. Furthermore, increasing patent citations and diversifying patent categories significantly enhance patent quality, with collaboration among patent teams playing a critical role in advancing cross-technology fields. These findings help optimize technological strategies, identify innovation gaps, and develop models for high-quality patent identification in energy utilization and recovery."

The existing backdoor often relies on visible universal triggers to make the backdoored model malfunction, which is not only usually visually suspicious to humans but also catchable by mainstream countermeasures. We propose an imperceptible sample-specific backdoor that the trigger varies from sample to sample and is invisible. Our trigger generation is automated through a denoising autoencoder that is fed with delicate but pervasive features (e.g., edge patterns per image). We extensively experiment with our backdoor attack on ImageNet and MS-Celeb-1 M, which demonstrates a stable and nearly 100% (i.e., 99.8%) attack success rate with negligible impact on the clean data accuracy of the infected model. The denoising autoencoder-based trigger generator is reusable or transferable across tasks (e.g., from ImageNet to MS-Celeb-1 M), whilst the trigger has high exclusiveness (i.e., a trigger generated for one sample is not applicable to another sample). Besides, our proposal backdoored model has achieved high evasiveness against mainstream backdoor defenses such as Neural Cleanse, STRIP, SentiNet, Fine-Pruning, BDMAE, and BTI-DBF."

    "abstract": "Accurate vessel centerline extraction in medical images has important clinical value for preoperative diagnosis and intraoperative intervention of vascular diseases. However, due to the irregular vascular contour, severe stenosis, and large variation of vascular scale, accurate 3D vessel centerline extraction is very challenging. This study aims to develop a new deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for 3D vessel centerline extraction. The proposed framework consists of three steps. 1) A novel adaptive state with vascular scale perception is introduced, which allows the tracker to focus on vessel-relevant areas and finally improves the accuracy of small vessels. 2) With the updated state, a spatial attention embedded deep reinforcement tracker predicts the tangential vector and step forward. 3) To safely pass through abnormalities areas, a vascular morphology based policy gradient is introduced, which encourages the tracker to move forward while getting as close to the centerline as possible. On a highly challenging 3D vessel dataset with 100 CTA scans, our method obtains mean centerline overlap of 95.26%, which outperforms four state-of-the-art centerline extraction methods. The proposed method is very fast and accurate, hence, it can provide a valuable tool for doctors in preoperative and intraoperative intervention of vascular diseases."

    "abstract": "Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has emerged as an advancement and generalization of the conventional diagonal RIS (D-RIS) by introducing tunable interconnections between RIS elements, enabling smarter wave manipulation and enlarged coverage. While BD-RIS has demonstrated advantages over D-RIS in various aspects, most existing works rely on the assumption of a lossless model, leaving practical considerations unaddressed. This paper thus proposes a lossy BD-RIS model and develops corresponding optimization algorithms for various BD-RIS-aided communication systems. First, by leveraging admittance parameter analysis, we model each tunable admittance component based on a lumped circuit with losses and derive an expression of a circle characterizing the real and imaginary parts of each tunable admittance. We then consider the received signal power maximization in single-user single-input single-output (SISO) systems with the proposed lossy BD-RIS model. To solve the formulated challenging optimization problem, we design an effective algorithm by carefully exploiting the problem structure. In particular, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework is custom-designed to deal with the complicated constraints associated with lossy BD-RIS. Furthermore, we extend the proposed algorithmic framework to more general multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems, where the transmit precoder and BD-RIS scattering matrix are jointly designed to maximize the sum-rate of the system. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that all BD-RIS architectures still outperform D-RIS in the presence of losses, but the optimal BD-RIS architectures in the lossless case are not necessarily optimal in the lossy case, e.g. group-connected BD-RIS can outperform fully- and tree-connected BD-RISs in SISO systems with relatively high losses at BD-RIS, whereas the opposite always holds true in the lossless case."

    "abstract": "Closed-loop manufacturing is an advanced production approach that requires data integration at all levels of the system architecture to support decision-making within the processes involved, thereby improving manufacturing efficiency. One of the main barriers to its full implementation is the lack of interoperable and automated inspection systems capable of detecting errors and enabling data feedback, with the potential for integration into closed-loop control systems. This article presents an integrated approach for the dimensional and geometric inspection of parts produced by additive manufacturing, combining a UR5e collaborative robot with a machine vision system. The proposed solution features an open architecture, is low-cost, and can operate directly in the production environment, reducing human intervention during the measurement process. The system performs both dimensional and geometric inspections on the same machine, leveraging the robot’s communication interfaces, control capabilities, and sensors to feed acquired data into a process control algorithm. Two evaluation strategies are presented: the first, based on machine vision, performs dimensional measurements and introduces a novel approach for parameterizing errors in printed corners using area-based analysis and linear regression; the second, based on the UR5e, performs contact-based inspection of geometric characteristics such as circularity, parallelism, and perpendicularity. The system achieved a standard deviation of 0.0378mm and can generate indicators such as the Filling Quality Index (FQI), Non-Printed Area Index (NPAI), and Unnecessary Printed Regions (INR). The proposed integrated architecture enables automated inspections with high precision and minimal human intervention, provides valuable data for quality control, and overcomes limitations of external metrology stations, with potential for future integration into automatic compensation schemes within digital manufacturing chains."

    "abstract": "For many years, in the HPC data distribution scenario, as the scale of the HPC system continues to increase, manufacturers have to increase the number of data providers to improve the IO parallelism to match the data demanders. In large-scale, especially exascale HPC systems, this mode of decoupling the demander and provider presents significant scalability limitations and incurs substantial costs. In our view, only a distribution model in which the demander also acts as the provider can fundamentally cope with changes in scale and have the best scalability, which is called all-to-all data distribution mode in this paper. We design and implement the BitTorrent protocol on computing networks in HPC systems and propose FD3, a fully decentralized data distribution method. We design the Requested-to-Validated Table (RVT) and the Highest ranking and Longest consecutive piece segment First (HLF) policy based on the features of the HPC networking environment to improve the performance of FD3. In addition, we design a torrent-tree to accelerate the distribution of seed file data and the aggregation of distribution state, and release the tracker load with neighborhood local-generation algorithm. Experimental results show that FD3 can scale smoothly to 11k+ computing nodes, and its performance is much better than that of the parallel file system. Compared with the original BitTorrent, the performance is improved by 8-15 times. FD3 highlights the considerable potential of the all-to-all model in HPC data distribution scenarios. Furthermore, the work of this paper can further stimulate the exploration of future distributed parallel file systems and provide a foundation and inspiration for the design of data access patterns for Exscale HPC systems."

    "abstract": "A high-resolution and multiple-tone microwave frequency measurement (MFM) method is proposed based on predefinable optical frequency combs (OFCs) using a dual-polarization dual-drive Mach–Zehnder modulator (Dpol-DDMZM). Two OFCs with predefinable spectrum shape are generated by electro-optic modulation (EOM) and mixed with the microwave signal under test (SUT) through photonic mixing with a single Dpol-DDMZM simultaneously, in which two minimum frequency components are generated mapping from SUT and used for SUT frequency recovery, respectively. The relative position between SUT and comb teeth can be determined with the power difference of the above two minimum frequency tones. In the proposed method, wideband and high-resolution are simultaneously guaranteed due to the combination of wideband photonic-assisted microwave photonic mixing and hyperfine electrical analysis. Moreover, it also enables multiple-tone measurement relying on the unique frequency-to-frequency mapping (FTFM) relationship between the SUT and the mixing frequency components. In the proof of concept, MFM is experimentally demonstrated up to a 40-GHz frequency range with a 10-kHz measurement error, and a two-tone MFM is also successfully implemented. More importantly, the proposed method features a reconfigurable measurement range just using a single Dpol-DDMZM and automatic frequency recovery with a frequency discrimination algorithm, which makes the measurement simple and compact."

    "abstract": "Multi-access edge computing provides localized resources within mobile networks to address the requirements of emerging latency-sensitive and computing-intensive applications. At the edge, dynamic requests necessitate sophisticated resource management for adaptive network slicing. This involves optimizing resource allocations, scaling functions, and load balancing to utilize only essential resources under constrained network scenarios. However, existing solutions largely assume static slice counts, ignoring the re-optimization overhead associated with management algorithms when slices fluctuate. Moreover, many approaches rely on simplified energy models that overlook intertemporal resource scheduling and are predominantly evaluated through simulations, neglecting critical practical considerations. This paper presents an incremental cooperative Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm for resource management in dynamic edge slicing. The proposed approach optimizes long-term slicing benefits by reducing delay and energy consumption while minimizing retraining overhead in response to slice variations. Furthermore, we implement an urban-wide edge computing testbed based on OpenStack and Kubernetes to validate the algorithm’s performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our incremental MADDPG method outperforms benchmark strategies in aggregated slicing utility and reduces training energy consumption by up to 50% compared to the re-optimization approach."

    "abstract": "Ensuring constant data quality has been preceded by the growing dependence on data-driven systems, especially in dynamic settings where distributions of data change with the passage of time. A model-oriented data validation system is outlined in this paper and includes the feedback loop mechanism to provide a constant monitoring, evaluation, and improvement of the quality of the data in use. Our approach in contrast to classical, and more common static validation schemes, utilizes the validation measures and internal representations as well as model stability performance measures to sense anomalies, drift and inconsistency in arriving data streams. The feedback loop does not only allow self-refinement of thresholding and validation rules but also ensures self-supervised quality control without loss of the system activity. The experimental findings in various areas such as industrial sensor applications, financial transactions, and healthcare data show that the offered framework enhances both the quality of the model and the quality of the decision made through pre-emptive filtering or flagging low-quality data. Such a model-sensitive feedback framework provides an intelligent and extensible data maintenance channel in dynamically changing machine learning platforms."

    "abstract": "One field of medicine undergoing transformation with the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in robotic systems is neurobiology. The development and use of artificial intelligence-assisted robotic devices in brain tumours biopsy procedures is examined in this article. Difficult and very delicate procedures, brain tumours biopsies must be carried out with great care and accuracy to ensure the patient is safe and the tissue is correctly obtained. Traditional biopsy techniques are prone to errors made by individuals, variations in competence, and difficulty reaching certain tumours locations. Since they increase accuracy, reduce running time, and make the whole process safer, AI-powered computer systems might be a decent approach to address these challenges. AI algorithms in the robotic systems can examine pre-surgery imaging, such as MRI and CT scans, and real-time figure out where the cancer is, what form it is, and what adjacent structures are. The robotic arm can therefore make decisions depending on the appearance of the tumour and move rather accurately. The technology also enhances visualization and supports decision-making by means of artificial intelligence-driven image analysis and predictive analytics. These characteristics let clinicians conduct biopsies with less danger of difficulties and greater faith. By monitoring and real-time process modification, AI-assisted systems may also aid enhance outcomes after surgery, therefore creating even more opportunities for future usage in neurosurgery. The most recent technical developments, clinical research, and probable advantages of artificial intelligence-assisted robotic systems in brain tumours biopsies are discussed in this article. It highlights their ability to transform neurosurgery by increasing patient accuracy and efficiency of treatments."

CPUs and GPUs are traditional computing architectures, but their power consumption and memory constraints often limit their performance. Embedded machine learning systems can be made more energy-efficient by using neuromorphic architectures. With neuromorphic computing, low-power, high-performance computation is achieved using spiking neural networks (SNN s). Our approach reduces energy consumption without compromising accuracy by combining approximate computing with neuron sensitivity analysis via backpropagation. Using datasets such as MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and the ASL Alphabet, neuromorphic systems are validated as being more energy-efficient, latency-free, and scalable than conventional systems. Intel's Loihi and NM500 hardware implementations have demonstrated that neuromorphic models consume over an order of magnitude less energy than GPUs and CPUs. As ML devices become more intelligent and sustainable, neuromorphic architectures have significant potential."

    "abstract": "The increasing use of review systems on marketplace platforms has led to the emergence of deceptive behaviors, particularly the generation of fraudulent reviews that mislead consumers and damage sellers' reputations. This study proposes a hybrid sentiment-based method for automatically labeling and detecting fake reviews. The process begins with text preprocessing-normalization, cleaning, and stemming-of Indonesian-language reviews, followed by translation into English to leverage two prominent sentiment analysis tools: VADER and TextBlob. A key contribution of this study is the introduction of VADERBLOB, a technique that merges outputs from both tools by assigning labels based on consensus or, in case of disagreement, selecting the label with the higher polarity score. This approach effectively detected 28 % of reviews as fraudulent and produced a more coherent label distribution compared to individual methods. Evaluation results demonstrated an accuracy of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 0. 6 0 \\%}$</tex>, precision of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{8 3. 5 7 \\%}$</tex>, recall of 82.98 %, and an <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$F 1$</tex>-score of 83.27 %, indicating the model's reliability for initial labeling. However, implementing this hybrid approach also presented specific challenges, including inconsistencies in sentiment interpretation between VADER and TextBlob due to contextual nuances, and potential translation artifacts affecting polarity scores. Addressing these issues required careful calibration of thresholds and validation logic to ensure classification robustness. These findings suggest that the combined sentiment-based method has significant potential for enhancing the accuracy of fake review detection, thereby contributing to a more trustworthy e-commerce environment."

Then we evaluate the electromagnetic responses to differentiate narcotics from other substances. The simulated data are used to confirm the accuracy and dependability of the system, ensuring a minimal rate of false detections. In addition, experimental validation was performed using a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) to verify the performance of the fabricated antenna and analyze its S parameters. This paper presents the combination of electromagnetic theory and antenna design to propose a potential innovation in effective narcotic detection. High frequency structure simulator (HFSS) software was used to model and simulate antenna parameters for designing, transmitting, and receiving signals.

As renewable energy resources like solar panels become more widely used, power converters are essential to interface them with larger systems such as nano-grids and microgrids. The proposed control method, by varying the zero-voltage states of Z-source converters and implementing closed-loop control, maintains a fixed switching frequency, resulting in improved efficiency. In addition, the converter operates with fully ZVS turn-on and ZCS turn-off for all full-bridge switches. Without a fixed DC link, the converter’s design must accommodate a wide range of switching frequencies, complicating the design and control of the switches. Simulation results validate the method, demonstrating significant improvements in efficiency and stability under various conditions."

    "abstract": "High-speed multiplication is an essential need in contemporary digital arithmetic, especially in domains such as digital signal processing, cryptography, and embedded systems. Conventional multipliers, i.e., array and Booth multipliers, have the disadvantage of increased latency due to sequential and intricate calculations. This paper discusses a high-performance hierarchical 8x8-bit Vedic multiplier based on the Urdhva-Tiryagbhyam sutra, which supports parallel multiplication to reduce critical path delays. The system proposed breaks down the multiplication process into 2x2 and 4x4 Vedic multiplier modules, combined with cascaded adders to compute the final 16-bit product. Verilog-based implementation uses modular, half-adder-based 2x2 units, interim 4x4 blocks, and optimized 6-bit, 8-bit, and 10-bit adders for aggregation of result efficiently. In contrast to traditional multipliers, this method includes lower latency, improved resource utilization, and enhanced scalability, which are highly amendable for FPGA/ASIC implementations. The suggested architecture improves computational efficiency, providing quicker arithmetic operations within time-sensitive digital systems."

    "abstract": "The rise of digital media has transformed the nature of political discourse in India, with satire, parody, and sarcasm becoming powerful tools for public expression. Platforms like Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, and YouTube have enabled the proliferation of user-generated content (UGC) that blends humor with political critique. This research explores the dynamic landscape of political parody in India by leveraging a Hybrid BERT-Transformer deep learning model to analyze user-generated content (UGC) from platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, and Instagram. With the rising influence of online satire in shaping political discourse, our model aims to detect and classify satire, sarcasm, parody, and political critique within multilingual and multimodal content. A curated dataset comprising text, memes, and video transcripts was annotated and preprocessed using tokenization, translation of regional Indian languages, and sentiment labeling. The proposed Hybrid BERT-Transformer model, fine-tuned on this dataset, achieved an overall accuracy of 92.4%, outperforming baseline models such as BERT+LSTM (86.8%) and traditional SVM-based classifiers (72.1%). Evaluation metrics including F1-score (90.9%) and ROC-AUC (0.94) further validated the robustness of the model. Additionally, attention-weight-based temporal and regional analysis revealed patterns in political parody frequency aligned with major political events. This approach demonstrates the potential of deep learning for nuanced socio-political content analysis in culturally diverse contexts like India."

    "abstract": "With quantum computing, traditional methods of encryption have become insufficient. This has led to the need for a transition to more reliable and flexible encryption systems. In this context, we examine the latest approaches to attribute-based encryption ABE schemes based on lattice cryptography and hybrid ones that combine symmetric encryption with public key ABE. These systems give post-quantum security in addition to fine-grained control, adaptive policy dynamic enforcement, and multi-level hierarchical control. We examine the most significant gaps regarding revocation, multi-authority frameworks, and ciphertext-controlled policies using LWE and Ring-LWE. Text length, key management complexity, and system interoperability are practical concerns too. A comparative analysis of five schemes shows each one's strengths and weaknesses. Designating the encryption phase speeds up the key generation process, so we implemented a multithreaded structure to address some of the identified performance constraints. This worked with other researchers designing robust quantum-access-controlled systems."

However, their widespread adoption has raised critical concerns around inherent biases present in the generated content, especially those related to gender, race, and profession. This paper investigates the presence and nature of bias in responses generated by GPT-4 through controlled prompt testing. We introduce a prompt pair generation methodology that varies only on identity-specific variables and assess the outputs of the model on semantic similarity, polarity of sentiment, and embedding-level discrepancy measures. We carry out experiments on 100+ prompt variations using Python and OpenAI's API and find discernible patterns for word associations and tone changes. In addition, the paper delves into lightweight mitigation techniques through rephrased prompts, system role setting, and output post-processing. Our work emphasizes that while GPT -4 shows diminished bias compared to its earlier ancestors, quantifiable differences persist in role-specific and stereotype-aware settings. Our contribution is an open, replicable bias-detection framework, alongside actionable feedback to researchers and practitioners seeking to leverage LLMs responsibly within sensitive fields like health, law, and education."

However, its low 0.6V I/O supply voltage and tight timing requirements pose significant challenges to signal integrity and synchronization. This paper presents a full LPDDR4X physical interface (PHY) in GlobalFoundries 12nm FinFET technology that addresses these issues through novel output driver calibration, digitally controlled delay lines, and de-skewing clock generators. We further incorporate On-Die Termination calibration with comparator offset compensation to ensure robust I/O performance. By integrating a RISC-V subsystem, our PHY enables low-level software control of the memory interface and a fully programmable calibration and training algorithm. The measured results from the fabricated prototype confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, achieving write margins of 300mV/0.61UI at 1.6Gbps and 200mV/0.38UI at 2.133Gbps. Post-layout simulations in all Process-Voltage-Temperature corners at 4.266Gbps show instead write margins of 80mV/0.57UI and 140mV/0.72UI in worst and best corners respectively. The measured output clock amplitude at 2.133GHz is 160mV differential.

However, conventional diagnostic approaches are mostly based on subjective judgments of clinicians, resulting in inconsistent diagnosis and treatments. In this work, we introduce an AI based Ayurvedic healthcare system powered by machine learning for automatic Prakriti classification and Dosha prediction. Our suggested model is predicting prakriti using Questionnaire based assessment. We used a Random Forest Classifier to predict the Prakriti (body type) of a person from Ayurvedic questions as taken by them. The random forest algorithm increases the stability of predictions by its combination of several decision trees as well as capturing complex patterns in the data. The model is trained on an equally proportioned and well-balanced dataset with the feature SMOTE being exploited to represent the Prakriti fairly, across all its types. This consists in data preprocessing, feature selection and model evaluation to increase accuracy of prediction. This AI-based solution has the capability to transform Ayurvedic health care more standardised and scalable. AyurWellness is a web application which includes Prakriti detection, personal health tips and recommendations, Ayurvedic home remedies, multilingual support, and nearby clinic finders. It is an initiative that connects past wisdom with current advances in technology to take holistic healthcare to users all over."

Multipoint imaging is driven by a 1 -to-10 pulse converter with Delay Locked Loop (DLL)-controlled delay lines, while TDCs achieve 68 ps resolution for precise Time-of-Arrival (ToA) capture. Monte Carlo simulations showed mean delays and standard deviations for the 1-to-10 converter and the TDCs to be 30.8 ns and 67.7 ps, and 35 ps and 1.4 ps, respectively.

For text-based mazes, we compare full reasoning with step-by-step control and demonstrate that the latter achieves almost the same level of accuracy for small and medium maps, while significantly reducing both runtime and token usage. For graphic maps, we conducted controlled experiments on intersections, systematically varying map colours, point placements and prompt formulations. The results show that accuracy depends not only on model size (GPT-5 outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-4.1, with higher computational cost), but also on map design and prompt clarity. Higher visual contrast and human-inspired prompt extensions improve performance. These findings emphasise the cognitive similarities between humans and LLMs in spatial tasks, as well as the ongoing challenges in achieving robust navigation."

This work introduces a scalable and interpretable machine learning-based power modeling framework that enables cycle-accurate estimation at the microarchitectural level using RTL simulation data. Targeting an in-order 32-bit RISC-V core derived from the RI5CY architecture, the framework leverages switching activity traces from Verilator simulations to train lightweight decision tree regressors capable of predicting dynamic power with high fidelity. The proposed design pipeline includes structured feature extraction (e.g., toggle counts, Hamming distances) and hierarchical modeling across processor blocks such as Fetch, Decode, Execute, and Load Store (LS) Unit. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.06% at the full-core level, significantly outperforming prior works while reducing simulation overhead. Experimental results over ten diverse benchmarks demonstrate improved cycle efficiency, enhanced model generalization, and interpretability. These findings establish a practical pathway for integrating fast, explainable, and RTL-aligned power prediction models in early-stage RISC-V processor design workflows, bridging the gap between architectural exploration and physical power estimation."

Automation of the encryption sequence is achieved through the application of Row Echelon form which streamlines data processing. Further, application of some non-linear functions like exponential and floor functions increases resistance to brute force and cryptanalysis attacks. Some Modular operations are employed to hide the data sequence structure with repeating moduli enhancing disguise. The idea of combining graph labeling techniques with some sophisticated mathematical tools provides an additional layer of security as compared to the traditional alternatives.

    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient detection of furcation involvement in dental X-ray images is crucial for timely diagnosis and treatment planning of periodontal disease. Current methods often rely on manual assessment, which is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to inter-observer variability. This research proposes a novel approach to automated furcation involvement detection using a hybrid deep learning model that combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The proposed methodology leverages the VGG16 architecture, a pre-trained CNN known for its robust feature extraction capabilities in image classification tasks. To enhance the model’s performance and address the limitations of relying solely on a CNN, SVM classifier is incorporated within a hybrid deep learning framework. Two fusion strategies are explored: early fusion, where the features extracted from the VGG16 fully connected layer are directly concatenated with the SVM; and late fusion, where the outputs of the VGG16 softmax layer and the SVM are combined. This comparative approach allows us to assess the effectiveness of each fusion technique in improving furcation detection accuracy. To assess model performance, 10-fold cross-validation is used, which reduces bias and offers a credible estimate of generalization performance. The models' diagnostic skills are assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. For furcation identification, the hybrid deep learning strategy outperformed the VGG16 model in the testing. Adding the SVM classifier earlier in the feature processing pipeline improves performance, as the early fusion technique consistently beats the late one. These results demonstrate the SVM’s capacity to learn complicated decision boundaries and enhance classification accuracy in this application. The best model, based on early fusion and the SVM classifier, has 91.24% accuracy, 90.9% precision, 93.04% recall, and 91.52% F1-score. This shows that our hybrid deep learning strategy can accurately and efficiently detect furcation involvement in dental X-ray images. This automated method potentially helps doctors diagnose and treat periodontal disease early, increasing patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Many networked systems rely on hashing and randomized algorithms for tasks such as load balancing, thereby avoiding the need for coordination or communication among participants on each request. However, purely random routing can lead to collisions and missed opportunities for beneficial colocation. Quantum entanglement enables participants to instantly make correlated decisions without communicating. We explore how this capability can expand the Pareto frontier of achievable performance in networked systems, presenting both positive and negative results. Notably, many of these advantages can be realized using small, currently available quantum devices that can often operate at room temperature."

By leveraging explicit commands, e.g., prompts, which can be even launched via voice, VAs provide a very natural interface for end-users. However, the proper specification and evaluation of User-Managed Access Control Policies (U-MAPs), the rules issued and managed by end-users to govern access to sensitive data and device functionality within these VAs, presents significant challenges as this process is crucial for preventing security vulnerabilities and privacy leaks without impacting user experience. This work-in-progress study provides an initial exploratory investigation on whether current publicly-available VAs can manage U-MAPs effectively across differing scenarios. By conducting unstructured to structured tests, we evaluated the comprehension of such VAs, revealing a lack of understanding in varying U-MAP approaches. Our research not only identifies key limitations, but offers valuable insights into how VAs can be further improved to manage complex authorization rules and adapt to dynamic changes."

    "abstract": "Metacognitive reflection – awareness of one’s learning, feelings, and progress – is a 21st-century skill of utmost importance in modern education. Yet, as learning increasingly occurs in fast-paced, efficiency-driven digital learning environments, opportunities for deep reflection are often constrained. Metacognitive prompting, which explicitly scaffolds reflection, is commonly conceptualised regarding how much autonomy is afforded to students, whether open-ended or structured. In this study, we investigate how students perceive both styles of prompts, inspired by gamification design, in a digital learning environment. Interviews with eighteen undergraduate students were analysed with reflexive thematic analysis to explore their engagement with the prompts. Students made sense of the structured designs as clear and efficient, while open-ended prompts were seen as playful but ambiguous. Many students struggled to integrate the prompts into their workflow, especially when the value of reflection was not immediately apparent. These findings suggest that reflective tools in digital learning environments must go beyond simply adding prompts to content but should respect student autonomy and time constraints, while still ensuring that the integrity of the reflection activity is maintained. Insights from this study offer tentative propositions for future research into how gamification can support meaningful metacognitive reflection."

The JSC waveform typically employs a large bandwidth as it helps in performing radar functionality. However, UAV communication receivers typically operate at a much lower bandwidth as compared to radar. Therefore, this letter presents a communication receiver performance for two schemes: one that filters and samples a portion of the signal, while the other undersamples the entire received signal for bit detection. We analytically derive BER expressions for both schemes under imperfect CSI and assess their performance. The results show that undersampling provides better BER performance than with filtering at the same sampling rate, highlighting the robustness of the proposed receiver design."

These structures can generate picosecond spikes in response to dc and ac electric currents, thereby mimicking the reaction of biological neurons to an external stimuli. However, conventional AFM neurons have only one input, which significantly limits their applications. In this paper, we propose an approach to the implementation of a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">programmable</i> artificial neuron (P-neuron) based on conventional AFM neurons in the form of a simple, two-layer neural network. Each neuron in the first layer has an independent input, and all of their outputs are connected to a single main neuron in the second layer. This configuration allows the sensitivity of system to individual input signals to be changed independently and in real time by regulating the dc current applied to the first-layer neurons, which makes it possible to program the entire P-neuron structure. In addition, the P-neuron demonstrates the ability for controlled training. We demonstrate that a multi-input P-neuron can successfully classify small images (5×5 pixels) of English alphabet symbols. Recognition is based on analyzing the time characteristics of the output neuron signal and comparing them with reference samples. We believe that the obtained results are important for the development and optimization of ultra-fast neural network based on AFM nanostructures and AFM spintronic devices capable of generating and processing (sub-)terahertz-frequency signals."

Organizations wrestle with deciding whether to “expose or not to expose” their data through Web APIs and, depending on the nature of their business, mull over potential benefits and drawbacks. This is because data can be exploited and misused in unanticipated ways. Rate restriction techniques are frequently used to manage data access and protect back-end computing resources. The best choice for the maximum rate at which information can be “safely” provided to clients will determine its effectiveness. An important situation involves formal service-level agreements that govern the quality of services provided by public governments and private businesses. These firms might need to decide on a rate cap for their Web APIs that prevents unauthorized clients from accurately calculating service levels while still enabling the development of valuable value-added services. In this paper, we propose a statistical model for this problem and a technique, based on sampling tools, following brute-force, binary search, and heuristic search methods, to select an appropriate rate limit, and demonstrate its validity through a case study involving a large Italian bus company."

However, existing methods often fail to flexibly and effectively extract both the global correlations and local smoothness of the background components in <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">hyperspectral images</i> (HSIs). To mitigate this critical issue, we put forward a novel HAD method named HAD-EUNTRFR, which incorporates an enhanced unified nonconvex tensor ring (TR) factors regularization. In the HAD-EUNTRFR framework, the raw HSIs are first decomposed into background and anomaly components using the idea of tensor robust principal component analysis. The TR decomposition is then employed to capture the spatial-spectral correlations within the background component. Additionally, we introduce a unified and efficient nonconvex regularizer, induced by <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">tensor singular value decomposition</i> (T-SVD), to simultaneously encode the low-rankness and sparsity of the 3-D gradient TR factors into a unique concise form. The above characterization scheme enables the interpretable gradient TR factors to inherit the low-rankness and smoothness of the original background. To further enhance anomaly detection, we design a generalized nonconvex regularization term to exploit the group sparsity of the anomaly component. Based upon the above, we ultimately propose a scalable and reliable nonconvex HAD model. To solve the resulting doubly nonconvex model, we develop a highly efficient optimization algorithm based on the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">alternating direction method of multipliers</i> (ADMM) framework.

    "abstract": "Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in ubiquitous computing. However, it remains constrained by the challenge of balancing fine-grained temporal modeling with real-time efficiency on resource-limited devices. While Transformer-based models excel at capturing long-range dependencies, they suffer from high computational costs, limiting their applicability on resource-constrained devices. Linear attention mechanisms improve efficiency but often discard negative signals and produce overly smooth, high-entropy attention distributions, impairing the extraction of fine-grained patterns and degrading classification accuracy in complex scenarios. In this work, we present ActiFormer, a novel sign-aware linear attention framework tailored for sensor-based HAR to overcome these limitations. To preserve bidirectional signal dynamics, we introduce Sign-Aware Attention, which explicitly models both same-sign and cross-sign interactions between queries and keys, effectively retaining negative signals crucial for accurate recognition. Furthermore, we propose a learnable entropy-scaling function that compensates for the exponential scaling effect lost in linear attention, originally provided by softmax, solving the high-entropy attention weight issue by amplifying the importance of critical temporal points. Extensive experiments on four benchmark HAR datasets demonstrate that ActiFormer consistently outperforms CNNs, standard Transformers, and state-of-the-art linear attention models, both in accuracy and efficiency. Its lightweight design supports real-time inference on edge devices such as the Raspberry Pi 5, highlighting its practical deployability in real-world applications."

    "abstract": "The reliability of Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECSs) is frequently limited by failures in Back-to-Back Power Converters (BTB-PCs), particularly within the Rotor-Side Converter (RSC) switches, which are subjected to electrical and thermal stresses induced by extreme wind gusts. This study investigates the most intense Extreme Operating Gust (EOG) recorded in 2018 at La Ventosa, Oaxaca, Mexico, using a small-scale, grid-connected WECS based on a Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) and employing classical vector control. This study confirms that such extreme wind events can cause power quality disturbances–namely low-frequency overcurrents in the RSC and electrical flicker on the DC-bus–that have been shown in the literature to accelerate switch degradation. To address these issues, a vector control strategy employing Nonlinear Proportional-Integral (NL-PI) controllers is proposed, replacing Conventional Proportional-Integral (CPI) controllers. Validation through robust stability analysis, utilizing unstructured uncertainty models and MATLAB®'s stability margin analysis, indicates that NL-PI controllers achieve stability margins exceeding unity, while CPI controllers fall below this threshold, suggesting a higher susceptibility to instability. Sensitivity analysis highlights frequency-dependent gain uncertainty (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\delta$</tex-math></inline-formula>) as the primary factor affecting robustness. Overall, the results demonstrate that NL-PI-based vector control markedly improves converter resilience, providing a cost-effective solution for WECSs operating in gust-prone environments."

However, its deployment on resource-constrained devices is limited by model complexity. Devices with varying computational capacities require models of distinct architectures and complexity levels, motivating the design of a cross-architecture model compression scheme for DeepJSCC. In this paper, we propose a cross-architecture knowledge distillation framework called CAKDJSCC for heterogeneous DeepJSCC models. Specifically, we design a teaching assistant network with feature fusion modules (FFMs) that dynamically perceive architecture gaps between teacher and student models, thereby generating student-adaptive feature representations to alleviate feature space misalignment caused by architectural inconsistencies. In addition, we introduce a conditional information bottleneck (CIB) loss to optimize the distillation process, which prevents students from overfitting to teacher-specific inductive biases while enhancing knowledge transfer efficiency in cross-architecture scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the student model's reconstruction accuracy and perceptual quality without increasing the inference latency while minimizing the performance degradation during model compression."

This study presents an enhanced low-damage hybrid cyclic etching technology for AlGaN/GaN heteroepitaxy structures, combining oxygen plasma oxidation with HCl etching to achieve atomic-scale precision. By carefully controlling the oxidation layer thickness, this method preserves a low surface roughness of 0.228 nm and achieves an etching rate of 0.45 nm/cycle with excellent consistency. Compared to conventional ICP dry etching and KOH wet etching evaluated under identical experimental conditions, the proposed technique significantly reduces etching-induced-damage. When applied to the ohmic contact formation of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs using the same metallization scheme and annealing process, devices fabricated with the new hybrid etching method demonstrated a significantly lower contact resistance of 0.76 Ω7mm compared to those using conventional ICP etching (1.21 Ω7mm) or no additional etching after SiN removal (1.37 Ω7mm). Furthermore, these devices exhibited a threshold voltage of -6.5 V, a saturation drain current density of 880.55 mA/mm, and a knee voltage of approximately 4 V. This method also demonstrates potential for recessed gate etching and post-dry-etching damage repair, offering a promising solution for low-roughness surfaces processing with broad application prospects."

This study presents the results of the piloting of a Likert-type instrument designed to assess the technical and pedagogical usability, accessibility/inclusiveness, and the effectiveness of AI as a support tool in an educational platform focused on CT development. A non-experimental quantitative design of descriptive transactional type was applied to 218 users of a platform with AI integration. The findings indicate that: a) the restructuring of the instrument improved its reliability, validity, and coherence, consolidating a relevant model for evaluating educational platforms; b) the validation process highlights the need to assess platforms through technical and pedagogical lenses to ensure usability, accessibility, and inclusion; c) the inclusion of the AI dimension responds to the imperative of addressing emerging technologies from evaluative and pedagogical perspectives, making the instrument timely and context-aware; d) the instrument demonstrates cross-cutting potential and adaptability to various platforms, reinforcing its utility for advancing equitable digital education aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

These projects constitute an important part of the business and play a central role in the development, strategic vision, and maintenance of a company’s competitiveness and performance. However, from a strategic perspective, for these projects to generate value for the company, it must be guaranteed that the selected group of projects contributes to implementing the business strategy in terms of product lines, markets, technological platforms, and so on. PPM plays a vital role in enhancing a company’s competitiveness and overall performance, particularly in small firms where strategic alignment and resource optimization are crucial. This study examines the implementation of PPM practices in small software development firms, and explores managers’ perceptions of their impact on organizational performance. A mixed-method research design was employed, beginning with a quantitative exploratory study that identified small firms that actively applied PPM practices. Following this, a multiple case study was conducted to investigate how these firms implement PPM at the strategic, portfolio, and project levels. The findings support the hypothesis that small firms require a different approach than large firms and reveal the best practices that can support small software development firms in leveraging PPM to improve strategic coherence and operational effectiveness."

    "abstract": "Trajectory prediction is crucial in understanding human behavior around intelligent agents, such as self-driving vehicles or social robots. Nevertheless, conventional approaches often fall short in effectively modeling the intricate trajectory-scene interaction. As they typically rely on simple feature concatenation methods which can introduce scene information irrelevant to motion trajectories, this leads to insufficient understanding of the scene context and a decrease in prediction performance. To tackle the issue, we propose an Adaptive Progressive Transformer-based Trajectory Predictor, APT-TP, which precisely forecasts future trajectories under the fine-grained trajectory-scene interaction constraint. The scene semantic maps and trajectory heatmaps are initially fused at a coarse-grained semantic level through a cross-attention mechanism. Afterward, inverse reinforcement learning is introduced to learn the trajectory-scene interaction from the fused results and generate possible future path plans through the Gumbel-Softmax sampling strategy. Finally, the generated path plans regarding the trajectory-scene interaction constraint are fused with the refined motion features at a fine-grained policy level through a novel APFormer. An adaptive motion token extractor is used to mitigate the redundancy in the refined motion features. APFormer fuses motion information and path plans progressively to generate future trajectories. APT-TP achieves promising performance on two benchmark datasets, Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD) and ETH/UCY, revealing its superiority. Moreover, qualitative evaluations demonstrate its effectiveness in exploring the trajectory-scene interaction, which is beneficial for ameliorated trajectory prediction performance."

This paper presents a hybrid framework integrating Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based time series forecasting with Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for intelligent energy routing across isolated DC nanogrid nodes. Using real-world energy and weather data from the UMass Smart project, GRU models were trained per node to forecast one-hour-ahead load and photovoltaic (PV) generation from <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2 4}$</tex>-hour historical sequences. Forecasts guided a reproducible ACO algorithm to compute power flows between surplus and deficit nodes over a resistance-weighted topology with 2 % line losses. The system achieved 61.29 % routing efficiency, redistributing 2.34 kWh across five nodes with 0.48 kWh transmission loss while reducing unmet demand. All models were implemented in Python using libraries with fixed seeds to ensure deterministic, hardware-independent prototyping. Results demonstrate the feasibility and performance gains of combining deep learning and bio-inspired optimization in renewable-centric, communication-light nanogrid environments."

The study used the Hydro One’s in-house bulk power system reliability evaluation program as a simulator to model the new energy resources and to evaluate their impacts on the system reliability and system operating costs. The proposed assessment method used in the study is practical and flexible and can handle different operating policies for those energy resources. The study results show that the impacts of those energy resources can vary significantly and power system planners and operators need to select, beforehand, the more effective ones with regard to system reliability and system operating cost. The IEEE reliability test system (RTS) is used in the study to illustrate the method of assessment."

MATLAB/Simulink environment is used to model and simulate the DFIG and the proposed control methods. When compared to the conventional PI controller, the results indicate that the Fuzzy-PI exhibits the overall best results, yielding steady-state ripple superiorities of above $80 \\%$.

This study proposes a dynamic, intelligent traffic management system that adapts signal timings based on real-time traffic conditions. Using YOLOv8 for object detection, the system identifies both the number and type of vehicles to optimize signal intervals accordingly. Traffic data is gathered by high-definition cameras on either side of an intersection. These cameras use IOT integration to send live video streams to a centralized server that calculates signal timing and houses the detection model. Dynamic decision-making and low-latency communication are guaranteed by this architecture. The technology prioritizes emergency cars by modifying signal flow, and it also detects accidents and alerts authorities via a web application. This system could replace conventional traffic signals when widely used, which would cut down on traffic, accidents, pollution, and travel times in urban areas."

Utilizing the Lyapunov function as the foundation, the simulations evaluate each control strategy’s ability to maintain trajectory tracking accuracy. The findings reveal that while PD and PID controllers experience significant deviations from the desired trajectory under disturbances, Backstepping control demonstrates superior performance. It consistently maintains trajectory precision, exhibits greater resilience to external disturbances, and quickly corrects any deviations.

    "abstract": "This poster presents a novel approach for modeling and controlling a Small Modular Reactor (SMR) cogeneration power plant for District Heating Network (DHN) applications, aimed at decarbonizing energy systems. Existing studies, such as [1], do not adequately address key dynamics, including piping heat losses, thermal delays, variations in thermal demand, transient thermal responses, and dynamic interactions within the DHN, which limits the model’s ability to accurately assess system stability and its transient thermo-electrical performance under fluctuating load conditions. Additionally, the absence of proper multi-timescale dynamic analysis restricts the model’s ability to capture both short-term dynamics (seconds to minutes), which are critical for transient stability, and long-term behavior (hours to days), which is necessary for understanding daily thermal load variations. Thus, the main contribution of this paper is the development of a comprehensive cogeneration power plant model based on a Boiling Water SMR (BWSMR), which is distinct from the Integrated Pressurized Water Reactor (IPWR) model in [1]."

Understanding the desire for charging electric vehicles is now very important to make sure that electric energy is always being used. Using real-world data and the Extra Tree Regression (ETR) model, this study uses a data-driven approach to predict the demand for charging stations for electric vehicles. Using an 80/20 split, it trained and tested ETR on the data and got an R2 score of 95.92% and an RMSE of 0.1807%, which was better than models like LSTM, AR, K-means++-GRU-KSVR, ARMA, RNN, and Decision Trees. The model’s capacity to capture complicated nonlinear interactions and seasonal patterns was validated by the analysis of EV load data time series and correlation. The Extra Tree Regression model really outperformed other conventional techniques in terms of forecasting EV charging load, achieving extremely high accuracy. Short-term load forecasting in EV charging infrastructure is provided by this methodology with a robust and scalable framework, with which energy allocation and operational planning can be done better. The method can be further extended, if desired, to include outside influences such as weather and electricity rate to gain improved forecasting accuracy."

The Universal Specification Format (USF) is an existing approach to formal specification, which is used to prove the correctness of Register-Transfer Level (RTL) designs. Still, using such formal specifications as verification references requires validating that the specifications themselves are correct, which is often performed dynamically through usecase simulation. To fulfill the need for dynamic evaluation, we present a model-driven code generator that translates static USF specifications into untimed software simulations. The translation preserves hardware semantics by reordering operations and utilizing untimed, event-based interface handshakes. Our application to different hardware components, including a RISC-V processor, demonstrates the versatility and reusability of the code generation approach. Due to the abstract nature of the generated models, they execute between <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1.5-4.5 \\times$</tex> faster than RTL simulations and can be constructed early in the design process without concrete timing information."

This can be facilitated by the use of deep learning-based drones in disaster environments that are difficult to manage solely by human effort.

We then train the YOLOv10 algorithm on the dataset and evaluate its performance as well as the results obtained.

Four categories of cyberattack scenarios targeting the process were executed on an open-source standalone digital twin of an industrial filling plant: command injection, network denial of service (NDoS), calculated measurement modification, and naive measurement modification. A combined classifier is proposed as a real-time intrusion detection system (IDS) based on the offline evaluation of eight supervised machine learning algorithms. The designed combined classifier outperforms previous methods in terms of F1-score and precision by combining predictions from different algorithms while being capable of detecting and classifying intrusions in near real-time.

Each grade consisted of three beam types: a plain control beam (PB), a bottom single-strip GFRP-wrapped beam (BSS), and a bottom double-strip with U-shaped vertical GFRP-wrapped beam (BDS & UVDS 90). Flexural tests were conducted under two-point loading to evaluate the performance enhancement due to GFRP strengthening. Linear Variable Differential Transformers (LVDTs) were placed at the mid-span to measure deflection, and these were interfaced with an ESP32 microcontroller and NB-IoT module for wireless data transmission to a cloud-based dashboard. Results revealed significant improvements in both load-carrying capacity and crack resistance. The most effective configuration, the double-strip with U-wrap, increased ultimate load by up to 33.5 % in M25 beams and 32.3% in M40 beams, and delayed first cracking load by up to 54.5 %. The IoT-enabled system provided accurate, real-time monitoring, enabling scalable and remote structural health assessment.

This paper aims to propose a methodology for probabilistically evaluating the risks of connecting new renewable power plants, with an emphasis on evaluating the expected curtailment for the new accessor generation. The method is a probabilistic power flow tool based on pseudo-sequential Monte Carlo simulation to account for the inherent uncertainties of load, renewable generation, and equipment contingencies.

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the development of cyber–physical–social systems (CPSSs), the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and social networks has been advocated to promote further development. Multimedia big data (MMBD) generated by Social Internet of Things (SIoT) devices is commonly distributed and stored on edge servers. In this context, collaborative processing of user requests among edge servers becomes crucial to meet the low-latency retrieval needs of users. However, in practice, the lack of global data storage information leads to significant time and space costs when identifying servers across the entire system. To tackle this issue, we propose a distributed edge data indexing system named FMQS, aiming to achieve fast MMBD queries at the edge. First, we introduce the cuckoo filter (CF) tree index structure, which enables rapid edge data queries. Second, we utilize a novel indexing structure based on the grouping cuckoo bloom filter (GCF) tree to improve query performance. What is more, we conceptualize distributed edge servers as entities within social networks, optimizing their relationships in terms of geographical proximity to improve query performance. Finally, we conduct performance evaluation, security verification, and analysis of the FMQS scheme on an edge storage system consisting of 90 edge servers, further confirming the effectiveness and feasibility of FMQS in MMBD queries."

    "abstract": "To achieve the net zero objective, the Chinese government has established various types of carbon markets including China Emission Allowance (CEA) and Chinese Certified Emission Reduction (CCER). However, current carbon market face challenges such as inflexible offset mechanism for CCER and transaction data security weaknesses which collectively hinder efficient resource allocation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving approach for Joint Carbon Reduction and Emission Allowance Trading (JCREAT). The scheme integrates the secure multi-party computation (SMPC) protocol using secret sharing with the primal-dual gradient algorithm. Specifically, a joint trading model considering CCER offset cap is first developed to maximize social welfare. Subsequently, a privacy-preserving clearing method utilizing SMPC is proposed to address carbon market data security issue. The method employs the primal-dual gradient algorithm to solve the joint trading model and applies the SMPC protocol to transform plaintext computations into ciphertext computations, thereby enhancing trading security. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme not only achieves the optimality of market clearing outcomes, but also effectively protects the privacy of participants, thereby validating the feasibility of integrating privacy-preserving computation with carbon market mechanism."

    "abstract": "In molecular communications (MC), inter-symbol interference (ISI) and noise are key factors that degrade communication reliability. Although time-domain equalization can effectively mitigate these effects, it often entails high computational complexity concerning the channel memory. In contrast, frequency-domain equalization (FDE) offers greater computational efficiency but typically requires prior knowledge of the channel model. To address this limitation, this letter proposes FDE techniques based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, enabling temporal correlation modeling in MC channels to improve ISI and noise suppression. To eliminate the reliance on prior channel information in conventional FDE methods, a supervised training strategy is employed for channel-adaptive equalization. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LSTM-FDE significantly reduces the bit error rate compared to traditional FDE and feedforward neural network–based equalizers. This performance gain is attributed to the LSTM’s temporal modeling capabilities, which enhance noise suppression and accelerate model convergence, while maintaining comparable computational efficiency."

    "abstract": "Emerging low-altitude economy networks require agile and privacy-preserving resource control under dynamic agent mobility and limited infrastructure support. To address these challenges, we propose a vision-aided integrated sensing and communication framework for intelligent aerial agent-assisted access systems, where onboard masked De-Diffusion models extract compact semantic tokens, including agent type, activity class, and heading orientation, while explicitly suppressing sensitive visual content. These tokens are fused with mmWave radar measurements to construct a semantic risk heatmap reflecting motion density, occlusion, and scene complexity, which guides access technology selection and resource scheduling. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to jointly maximize weighted energy and perception efficiency via radio access technology (RAT) assignment, power control, and beamforming, subject to agent-specific QoS constraints. To solve it, we develop De-Diffusion-driven vision-aided risk-aware resource optimization algorithm (DeDiff-VARARO), a novel two-stage cross-modal control algorithm: the first stage reconstructs visual scenes from tokens via De-Diffusion model for semantic parsing, while the second stage employs a deep deterministic policy gradient-based policy to adapt RAT selection, power control, and beam assignment based on fused radar-visual states. Simulation results show that DeDiff-VARARO consistently outperforms baselines in reward convergence, link robustness, and semantic fidelity, achieving within 4% of the performance of a raw-image upper bound while preserving user privacy and scalability in dense environments."

The main difficulty is that the sensor faults studied here directly affect the control signal rather than the agent's local output, causing traditional observers based on control inputs and outputs to fail in detecting such sensor faults. In addition, sensor faults and actuator faults are coupled, as the relative output information measured by sensors is directly involved in the design of attack-free consensus protocol. To tackle these difficulties, we developed the FTAF-AFDO, inspired by unknown input observer and Luenberger observer. This observer generates a sensor fault indicator signal that fully decouples from estimation errors and actuator faults within a fixed time, without needing any prior knowledge of the actuator faults. Additionally, leveraging the proposed FTAF-AFDO, a distributed attack-free consensus protocol is developed, capable of completely isolating the impact of actuator faults. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulations of a formation-flying transport aircraft system."

The method operates in two stages: first, a sampling-based exploration of the configuration space is performed to construct a safe corridor composed of axis-aligned bounding boxes. Within this corridor, an optimisation-based trajectory generation phase addresses the channel problem by computing smooth joint trajectories as non-rational splines. A multi-objective cost function is minimised to reduce geometric acceleration along the path, while also maximising the distance from obstacles to improve safety margins. The proposed algorithm is general and applicable to a wide range of kinematic structures, and supports user-defined path degree and geometric continuity. Simulation results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, and experimental validation further confirms its practical effectiveness. Our implementation is open-sourced and available on Github."

The problem is that ϵ does not have any intrinsic meaning, and it is generally not possible to compare across variants of the framework (such as Rényi DP or Concentrated DP). Work in image processing has therefore explored how to <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">empirically calibrate</i> noise across frameworks using Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). However, this kind of calibration has not been established for NLP. As the first finding of this paper, we show that MIAs offer little help in calibrating privacy, whereas reconstruction attacks are a more useful potential calibration solution. As a use case, we define a novel kind of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">directional privacy</i> based on the von Mises-Fisher (VMF) distribution, a metric DP mechanism that perturbs angular distance rather than adding (isotropic) Gaussian noise, and apply this to NLP architectures. We show that, even though formal guarantees are incomparable (that is, the Gaussian mechanism’s privacy parameter ϵ cannot be directly linked to the VMF’s parameter), empirical privacy calibration permits a comparison and reveals that each mechanism has different areas of strength with respect to utility-privacy trade-offs."

The goal is to minimize resource consumption while satisfying user quality of experience (QoE) requirement, which is measured by the weighted sum of visual quality, quality variation, and round-trip interaction latency. Specifically, we present a mobility model to capture both user spatial movements and XR content interaction features. Since user viewing distance and interaction time are key model parameters that affect the spatiotemporal service demand for XR content rendering and delivery at the edge, we estimate user-specific model parameters and adopt a sample average approximation method to model the relationship between user QoE and the consumption of both communication and edge computing resources. We design a coordinate descent algorithm to make resource provisioning decisions, where a deep neural network provides a valuable initial point to accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme is more efficient to utilize network resources in comparison with benchmark schemes while satisfying user QoE requirements."

    "abstract": "Computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools consume a large amount of raw materials in its manufacturing process. With the emphasis on the economy of machine tools, reducing the material consumption becomes significant. The lightweight optimization is regarded an effective way for material saving, since it can reduce the cost while improving machining performance. However, existing lightweight studies of machine tool mainly depend on experience, which cannot ensure the accuracy and efficiency, and the design scheme is hard for manufacturing. On this basis, a novel data-driven lightweight optimization method with meta-structure integrating the topological and size optimization is proposed in this article. Meta-structures are modeled to form the topological configuration of machine tool for avoiding time-consuming design analysis. The surrogate models with a novel adaptive sequential sampling method are built to fit accurate relationships between structure and performances. A multi-objective size optimization frame is developed for further reducing the mass, deformation and enhancing natural frequency of machine tool. The gear honing machine tool is taken as the case study, where results indicate that the lightweight optimization can reduce mass by 13.72% under the premise of structure safety."

However, current UAV authentication protocols face critical security challenges such as high computational overhead, complex key management, and vulnerabilities to network attacks. This paper proposes a hierarchical authentication protocol that enhances resilience against attacks while maintaining ultra-low overhead. The protocol employs a two-tier mutual authentication architecture, comprising authentication between the base station and the server, and between the server and the UAV leader. This design effectively reduces the risk of single-point failure and improves scalability in large-scale swarm scenarios. Physical unclonable function (PUF) technology establishes secure UAV identities, combined with randomized leader election enhance security, reduce overhead, and increase attacker localization complexity. This paper presents a lightweight cryptographic strategy that combines hash-based challenge encryption and XOR-based response obfuscation to disrupt predictable PUF challenge-response mappings, countering machine learning (ML)-based modeling attacks. The proposed protocol passes security tests using ProVerif and Scyther. The scheme achieves 58.21% lower communication costs than existing approaches, with an authentication overhead of 58.04 μs."

In this work, we present a framework for global and local sensitivity analysis of a V-shaped Interior Permanent Magnet (IPM) motor using surrogate modeling and Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE). A neural network surrogate is trained on a dataset of high-fidelity finite element simulations to predict torque and temperature as functions of eight design parameters. Global sensitivity analysis is performed via PCE, enabling the computation of Sobol’ indices and statistical metrics with negligible computational cost. The surrogate-based PCE results are validated against finite element-based model evaluations, confirming their accuracy and convergence. A local analysis is also performed along the Pareto front, where input parameters are perturbed within a narrow range to estimate confidence intervals around optimal solutions. This enables the quantification of robustness and highlights trade-offs between performance and sensitivity. The proposed approach offers an efficient method for integrating uncertainty-aware decision-making into the early stages of electric motor design."

Australia's dry and warm climate makes it prone to wildfires, which puts the ecosystem at risk and decreases the forest area. Hence, it is necessary to reduce bushfire risk by monitoring their intensity. The availability of remotely sensed data enables us to analyze wildfires, explore and discover the patterns, and help provide real-time warnings. This work examined the forest fire data during 2018–2020, considering parameters like Brightness (Prediction) and Fire Radiative Power (Classification). The analysis is conducted using several machine learning algorithms like Random Forest (RF), Decision Trees (DT), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (xGB), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), etc. The prediction models were evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), R squared (R2), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). In contrast, the classification models were assessed based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score. Our study shows that the RF model is the best prediction model, and the ANN model is the best classification model compared to the baseline models."

We evaluate our approaches under various configurations, including different DNN models such as LeNet and DarkNet, various NoC sizes with different numbers of memory controllers, random weights and trained weights, and different data precision.

    "abstract": "Early and accurate prediction of cerebral vascular accidents (CVA) is essential for timely intervention and improving patient outcomes. This study investigates various classification algorithms to predict stroke. Recent advances in machine learning have shown great potential in helping with medical analysis and disease prediction. Methods including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN, Random Forests, Naive Bayes, and SVM are integrated to a medical database to evaluate their performance. Deep learning was not considered, as the dataset is small and structured; traditional machine learning models were more suitable and effective. Among these methods, SVM and Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy compared to others. However, after applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the Decision Tree algorithm provided the best accuracy."

Meanwhile, software performance testing is an essential type of software testing that ensures stable software behavior under various scenarios. This paper aims to point out the most common approaches in integrating Generative AI across the stages of software performance testing and in related software testing activities, as well as the main challenges and limitations faced by researchers. This research followed the systematic literature review approach to analyze and synthesize the existing studies on the application of Generative AI in software performance testing. Within the review, eight papers published between 2024 and 2025 in research literature databases, including ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar, were selected and analyzed. The review results reveal that the application of Generative AI is mainly concentrated in functional testing, specifically in test case generation, with a limited adoption in test scenario generation and capturing non-functional requirements. Key challenges identified include the inconsistency of generated output and hallucinations of LLMs. The findings indicate a significant research gap in applying Generative AI in the process of software performance testing."

This paper presents a hybrid framework for heart disease prediction that combines advanced feature engineering with multiple machine learning and ensemble techniques. Initially, three classifiers were evaluated, and based on encouraging results, the framework was extended to include seven base models: Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, and Naïve Bayes. A comprehensive feature engineering process was implemented using statistical transformations, interaction terms, and tree-based embeddings, followed by recursive feature elimination for optimal feature selection. Two ensemble strategies—stacking and voting—were applied to combine base model outputs. The stacking ensemble achieved best accuracy of 98%, significantly outperforming individual models. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach offers a robust and scalable solution for heart disease prediction using clinical datasets."

In response to the spatiotemporal coupling characteristics and data privacy requirements of traffic flow, this study proposes a vehicle networking data mining and prediction framework that integrates multi-source data preprocessing, spatiotemporal joint modeling, and privacy protection. Using D-S evidence theory and DBSCAN density clustering to clean raw GPS data and identify high-frequency parking spots, a 27 dimensional feature vector is constructed that includes temporal statistics, road network topology, and POI semantics; Design a GNN-LSTM hybrid model that utilizes graph neural networks (GNN) to capture spatial dependencies in road networks, combines long short-term memory networks (LSTM) to model temporal dynamics, and introduces attention mechanisms to optimize spatiotemporal weight allocation. The experiment was validated based on a real vehicle networking dataset, and the results showed that the average absolute error (MAE) of the model in the morning rush hour scenario of a single road segment was 45.3 veh/h, which was 27.0% lower than the traditional LSTM model; The average absolute percentage error (MAPE) of regional road network prediction is 9.8%, a significant improvement of 23.7%. In addition, by optimizing model parameters through genetic algorithms and integrating partial homomorphic encryption techniques, the error amplification caused by privacy protection is controlled within 4.3% while ensuring prediction accuracy. The research results provide efficient and safe technical solutions for applications such as dynamic path guidance and congestion warning in the Internet of Vehicles, which is of great significance for improving the utilization of transportation resources and travel efficiency."

This study presents a machine learning-based dynamic load balancing framework utilizing the Google 2019 Cluster Sample dataset to enhance resource allocation in cloud networks. High-performance predictions of CPU utilization were achieved through the use of Machine Learning techniques such as Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost, which produced R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> values of 0.9999 and 0.9998 for each model. Load balancing decisions were derived dynamically based on predicted CPU loads compared to a defined threshold, demonstrating the system's ability to assess and maintain balance without unnecessary migrations. Additionally, K-Means clustering was applied for workload characterization, achieving a silhouette score of 0.137 across eight clusters. The performance of the proposed RF and XGBoost methodologies was examined relative to sophisticated models including LSTM, ARIMA, BI-LSTM-LSTM-GRU, and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN), thereby showing the efficacy of the proposed methodologies with superior accuracy and speed in dynamic cloud resource management.

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the way software engineers go by their day-to-day coding tasks. However, AI impact on hardware design and verification is still a territory that is yet to be thoroughly explored [1]. While there are some research papers that explore the significant advancements in AI-driven hardware designs [2], there is a lack of comparative studies that focus specifically on how these designs compare to hardware designs fully designed by expert human engineers. For this reason, this paper presents a detailed comparative analysis between human-written and AI-generated RTL by designing and verifying the USB4 Logical Layer, an integral part of the latest USB Protocol [3]. The complexity and the lack of publicly available USB4 architectures ensures that the used AI tools are fully relying on their own generative capabilities to produce good quality RTL without the usage of any public implementations which further solidifies the outcomes of this paper. The preliminary results indicate that AI-generated designs can significantly reduce design time while maintaining high levels of accuracy. Based on the findings, the research offers practical guidelines for integrating AI into the RTL design process. These include best practices for leveraging AI tools and common pitfalls to avoid."

    "abstract": "The local deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for privacy and latency in several domains. However, it faces significant challenges in terms of memory, power, and inference speed, particularly in resource-constrained systems such as Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing devices. Most existing studies emphasize compression and hardware tuning, while holistic system-level optimization remains incomplete, and the role of prompt design is still underexplored. This study introduces a structured evaluation of prompt engineering strategies designed to enhance resource efficiency and accuracy in local LLMs, applied across three textual analysis tasks: theme extraction, frequency analysis, and impact analysis. Four experimental conditions were compared: Baseline, System Prompt Only (SP), User Prompt Only (UP), and System+User Prompt (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$S P+U P$</tex>). Using multiple LLMs ranging from 1 B to 70B parameters, we audited tokens generated, latency, VRAM usage, hallucination rates, and other structural errors. The results show that System Prompts alone substantially reduced computational overhead, whereas User Prompts improved accuracy and task alignment. Their combination yields comprehensive improvements, maximizing both efficiency and reliability. The proposed prompt design enabled smaller LLMs to rival larger ones in efficiency and accuracy, with LLaMA-3.2, 3B with SP+UP reducing VRAM by 96%, latency by 85%, and hallucinations by 83% when compared to the 70B with Baseline. Even LLaMA-3.2, 1B proved to be a viable option, especially when VRAM size is a critical factor."

    "abstract": "As the population of digital citizens continues to grow, with more individuals spending their time online to share their state of emotions, thoughts, and personal experiences, social media has emerged to be a promising space to identify early signs of mental health crises. With the aim of leveraging the current widespread use of digital platforms such as social media as a means of self-expression, artificial intelligence (AI) technology offers a proactive approach in identifying early signs of various mental health issues, thereby enabling preventive measures to be taken before a crisis occurs. This paper explores previous research on how AI has been used to identify mental health conditions in social media platforms. Using a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology, 25 studies were selected and were synthesized to identify 27 essential factors influencing AI implementation in this domain. These factors were then mapped across five types of analytics models, which include descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive, and cognitive. The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic overview of research in the domain of AI-based mental health monitoring, mainly focusing on social media. This paper also explores how AI-powered analytics can support early detection and support meaningful interventions for mental health crises, contributing to SDG 3, particularly Target 3.4, by promoting mental wellbeing and improving access to mental health care."

    "abstract": "This study presents a novel deep learning model using a bidirectional gated recurring unit with a capsule network, HS-CBi-Gru, a deep learning model for the detection of network attacks on smart devices. This proposed modified algorithm will be compared with existing deep learning algorithms, such as Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Bi-Gated Recurrent Units (Bi-Gru), using the result parameters such as precision, recall, F-measure, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, etc. We evaluated this model on UNS NB15 datasets to classify network attacks on smart devices. In terms of precision, recall, F-measure, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and other metrics, the proposed model performs best. The novel HS-CBi-Gru deep learning model proposed performs much better than existing deep learning algorithms."

By enabling variable active subcarriers per subblock, it outperforms conventional fixed subcarrier methods. Generalized index modulation (GIM) dynamically encodes additional information alongside QAM symbols. Two detection methods, energy detection (ED) and log likelihood ratio (LLR) based detection, are introduced and compared, demonstrating the adaptability and robust performance of AFDM-GIM. Simulations under high mobility conditions show superior bit error rate and spectral efficiency compared to AFDM-IM and conventional AFDM, making AFDMGIM a strong candidate for future 6 G networks.

    "abstract": "The development of the Criminal Recognition and Identification System, or CRISYS, can be described as the most significant technological advance law enforcement technology has made so far. It can produce visual images of suspects based solely on descriptive text with the help of artificial intelligence. This paper explores a novel strategy that draws on NLP and GANs to transform complex facial characteristics from eye color and hairstyle to facial structure and unique features—to crisp image representations. We deeply consider the approach of parsing and interpreting descriptions into input images, the design of the model for generating images, and the ways the system may contribute to criminal investigations and other applications. Our results in this research highlight the potential that CRISYS has to increase investigation efficiency and precision while simultaneously emphasizing the critical need for ethical considerations and protective measure. This work falls under the burgeoning realm of AI criminal justice and offers a roadmap for developing responsible and powerful identification systems. Rigorous testing of the system revealed its capability to produce outputs that surpassed existing state-of-the-art models in terms of visual fidelity and descriptive accuracy."

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of data has brought full-size challenges in corporation and management. Cloud computing, with its scalability and value-performance, has become critical for data availability and security. However, optimizing information placement in cloud storage stays vital; flawed business enterprise can increase expenses and degrade performance. To address this, the paper endorses a novel method that combines Adaptive Erasure Codes with a Hybrid Genetic-Greedy algorithm for most effective records placement in cloud garages. Adaptive erasure codes dynamically adjust their parameters based on factors such as access patterns, failure rates, and system load, enhancing storage efficiency and real-time performance. The hybrid set of rules integrates a genetic set of rules and a grasping set of rules, which refines these solutions via making locally optimum alternatives. The optimization process begins with a populace of data placement solutions, evaluating the usage of a fitness feature that considers facts to get entry to styles, garage charges, and redundancy desires. The grasping set of rules then pleasant-tunes these answers, ensuring fee-powerful data placement. Thus, the proposed approach improves the reliability and performance of cloud storage by achieving 93.87% efficiency in storage and data placement, surpassing the performance of other existing traditional algorithms in terms of speed, network stability, error rate and storage node health."

    "abstract": "The zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR) task aims to retrieve images associated with sketches from unseen classes, bringing great convenience to the engineering field. To address the modality gap, most existing works project images and sketches into a shared Euclidean space. However, the hierarchical structure of image data makes the Euclidean space not the optimal choice as an embedding space for representing complex structured image data. Meanwhile, existing text and hierarchical models are not effective enough for addressing the problem of knowledge transfer. To address these issues, this paper proposes an original hyperbolic-based cross-modal semantic remodeling network (called HCMSN) for ZS-SBIR. Specifically, this paper proposes to extract category-level word embeddings based on BERT model, then align image features and sketches with the word embeddings using adversarial methods. Meanwhile, this paper further proposes a cross-modal retrieval feature reconstruction network for improving the informativeness and robustness of retrieval features. Moreover, this paper presents a feature projection network that maps the retrieval features to the hyperbolic space to generate the hyperbolic retrieval features, thus effectively representing the data with hierarchical structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the mAP@all of our HCMSN model surpasses CNN-based models by 20.9% on the Sketchy dataset, 1.2% on the more difficult TU-Berlin dataset, and 13.6% on the more challenging QuickDraw dataset."

We propose a design which we call the CPX (Consolidated IPX/IXP) where the roaming network converges with the Internet by leveraging existing edge providers to provide all the benefits that the IPX network provides. In addition to convergence, the CPX architecture provides lower latency for roaming users; in our simulation of a global CPX deployment, we demonstrate an average of 318% improvement in roaming connection latency."

Existing methods either rely on overly simplistic physical models that lack adaptability or on data-driven deep learning approaches that exhibit poor generalization. In this letter, we introduce a novel, physics-informed paradigm that synergizes the strengths of both approaches. We are the first to steer a learnable iToF forward model using powerful spatial priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Our framework leverages SAM's guidance to parameterize a reflectance-transmittance mixture model, providing a physically-grounded representation of the scene. This representation is then processed by a dual-stream network, featuring a Dynamic Channel Gate (DCG) and Cross-Attention Fusion (CAF), to intelligently interpret the raw iToF signals and reconstruct a high-fidelity depth map. Extensive experiments on the MSD, Trans10K, and ClearGrasp benchmarks demonstrate that our method not only sets a new state-of-the-art but also shows remarkable generalization from synthetic mirrors to real-world glass objects, offering a robust solution to this long-standing challenge."

    "abstract": "Inverse halftoning aims to reconstruct continuous-tone images from halftone patterns. Although many learning-based methods have achieved promising results, they often struggle to generalize across diverse halftoning schemes due to variations in noise distribution within the frequency domain. To alleviate this issue, this paper presents a multi-scale frequency-aware VAE-GAN framework that enhances the reconstruction of various halftone types. The model consists of a content synthesis module based on a variational autoencoder and a detail refinement stage using a generative adversarial network. Frequency-aware feature extraction and adaptive fusion mechanisms are employed to better capture multi-scale structures and suppress halftone artifacts. Experimental evaluations on several halftone datasets indicate that the proposed method provides consistent and visually faithful restoration, achieving competitive quantitative and perceptual metrics compared with existing approaches. While the framework builds upon prior multi-stage designs, it offers a practical and extensible solution for general inverse halftoning tasks rather than a radical architectural innovation."

This work investigates magnetically induced skin stretch as a non-invasive, potentially implantable alternative. We present MISS (Magnetically Induced Skin Stretch), a novel system that uses external coils to control magnets adhered to the skin, producing skin deformations that mimic subdermal implantation and evoke proprioceptive sensations. We conducted physical and psychophysical experiments, including Just Noticeable Difference and Point of Subjective Equality measurements. Eighteen participants, including five with transradial amputation, used the MISS device with a myoelectric prosthesis, where skin stretch was modulated in sync with prosthetic hand flexion. Results showed high object discrimination accuracy, with amputees performing comparably to able-bodied users. These findings demonstrate MISS as a promising proprioceptive feedback method, supporting its future integration into implantable systems."

Our physically-based rendering approach simulates light transmission using flux, without requiring prior knowledge of the light source's intensity distribution. To efficiently explore the light source parameter space during optimization, we apply a contraction mapping that converts the constrained problem into an unconstrained one. Using the optimized light source model, we then design the freeform lens shape considering flux consistency and normal integrability. Simulations and physical experiments show our method more accurately represents real surface light sources compared to point-source approximations, yielding caustic lenses that produce images closely matching the target light distributions."

    "abstract": "To obtain the design basis for the dynamic characteristic parameters of bridges commonly used in superconducting electromagnetic suspension transportation, a refined magnetic force calculation model is established to analyze the dynamic load characteristics of null-flux coils. The dynamic response laws of simply supported beams under four types of equivalent train loads are compared, demonstrating that concentrated superconducting coil load sequences provide sufficient accuracy for bridge dynamic factor analysis. Furthermore, parametric analyses are conducted to investigate the effects of vehicle spacing, bridge spans, and train formations on bridge dynamic factors, and the preferred range of common bridge spans and strategies for regulating dynamic factors are discussed. The results show that the optimal range for common bridge spans is 1.5 to 1.75 times the vehicle spacing. When the ratio of bridge span to vehicle distance is 1.5, first-order resonance of the bridge is suppressed, and the dynamic factors of first-order superharmonic resonance increases with the number of train formations. When the ratio is 1.75, it is necessary to increase the vertical fundamental frequency of the bridge to avoid first-order resonance within the range of train operating speeds. Matching a 24.3 m vehicle spacing with a 37.8 m span bridge, under a 14-car formation, both the first-order resonance and superharmonic resonance dynamic factors of the bridge are less than 1.8. This configuration represents the optimal design scheme for high-speed superconducting electrodynamic suspension systems in terms of vehicle spacing and standardized bridge spans."

    "abstract": "Central to the safety control problem is to compute a controlled invariant set that is as large as possible within a given safe region. However, this is not an easy task for interconnected systems due to the high cost i) for computing a high dimensional controlled invariant set at the design stage and ii) for subsystems communicating with a centralized controller at runtime. These two issues may be mitigated by considering a distributed control scheme. In this paper, we consider interconnected linear systems that allow local information sharing among adjacent subsystems w.r.t certain information structures, and propose a scalable (yet weakly complete) algorithm to compute a set that can be rendered invariant by a distributed controller, i.e., a distributed controlled invariant set (DCIS). In particular, different from safety control under centralized/decentralized scheme, we focus on understanding how the information structure affects the size of the DCIS. To that end, we give a criterion to prune useless communication links that do not enlarge a DCIS, and show that our algorithm nicely preserves the strength of the information structure. Two numerical examples illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach."

Leveraging a cluster-based architecture enabled by Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), our framework incorporates a Network Function Chain (NFC) method for autonomous networking and a stateless Satellite Live Migration (SLM) mechanism for enhanced mobility management. The feasibility and performance of the framework were validated on a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed emulating a compute-constrained satellite environment. Experimental results demonstrate rapid automated network deployment via NFC in approximately 23 seconds and highly efficient user context migration and service restoration via SLM, which adds only about 1 second of overhead for 1000 users. This work provides a validated engineering blueprint for future Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks (STINs), confirming that an autonomous, fully-featured OBCN is a feasible engineering reality.

In this survey, we dive into the study of two families of MR codes: MR locally recoverable codes (LRCs) (also known as partial MDS codes) and grid codes (GCs). For both families of codes, we discuss the primary recoverability guarantees of each class of codes as well as what is known concerning optimal constructions of each class of codes. Along the way, we discuss many surprising connections between MR codes and broader questions in computer science and mathematics. For MR LRCs, the use of skew polynomial codes has unified many previous constructions. For MR GCs, the theory of higher order MDS codes shows that MR GCs can be used to construct optimal list-decodable codes. Furthermore, the optimally recoverable patterns of MR GCs have close ties to long-standing problems on the structural rigidity of graphs."

    "abstract": "Drawing inspiration from piscine locomotion strategies, biomimetic underwater robotic systems demonstrate enhanced operational efficiency and stealth capabilities when executing target tracking missions within dynamic aquatic environments. However, challenges related to their operational speed and control precision hinder the timely and accurate completion of tasks. In this letter, a biomimetic wave-spiral robot with dual-mode propulsion capabilities is developed, and an autonomous switching tracking control algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed. First, the kinematic models of the fins and fin rays in both spiral and wave modes are derived, and a multi segmented splicing design is employed to produce multi-modal fins, resulting in an integrated propulsion structure compatible with both high-speed and high-maneuverability modes. Second, a tracking control system consisting of two independent DRL policy networks and an adaptive mode switcher is proposed to realize autonomous and stable tracking control. Finally, simulation and swimming pool experiments demonstrate that the wave-spiral robot equipped with the dual-mode adaptive switching algorithm significantly achieved a 95% task completion rate and an average reward of 0.85 in the target tracking control experiment. Moreover, it demonstrates a 29.5% improvement in operation time when dealing with state disturbances and dynamic targets compared with the traditional control method. This study provides a promising and robust solution for developing tracking control for multi-mode biomimetic robots."

The proposed approach involves preparing the time series data using a sliding window method that structures the hourly dataset into sequences suitable for long short-term memory (LSTM) models, which allows the Bi-LSTM architecture to incorporate features such as hour of the day, day of the week, day of the year, month of the year, week of the year, and ambient temperature.

In this paper, a $2 \\times 2$ microstrip patch antenna array is designed and optimized to operate efficiently in the $7-8 \\mathrm{GHz}$ spectrum.

    "abstract": "In cosmetics manufacturing, powders with different sizes, shapes, and properties are fed into liquids and mixed to create cosmetics with various functions. However, during the powder mixing process, powders not incorporated into the liquid form agglomerates and float on the surface of the liquid, with the result that it takes a long time until the powder is completely incorporated into the liquid and the mixing is complete. In general, powder mixing is performed using a HOMO-dispersion stirring impeller with a high-shear disperser blade. However, powder mixing with a dispersion impeller is dominated by radial discharge from the stirring impeller, which makes powder incorporation into the liquid difficult, resulting in the formation of agglomerates. Therefore, a new stirring impeller must be developed to prevent the formation of agglomerates during powder mixing. The purposes of this study were to clarify the mechanisms of agglomerate formation and powder suspension, propose a mechanism to prevent agglomerate formation, and develop a new stirring impeller for HOMO-disper. Finally, powder and liquid mixing experiments were conducted. The powder mixing experimental results showed that the proposed impeller can be used for mixing without forming agglomerates, demonstrating its effectiveness. The powder mixing process is a common production process in cosmetics manufacturing, pharmaceutical manufacturing and food processing, and our proposed impeller is therefore expected to play an active role in a wide range of fields.

To evaluate the model and hypotheses, 381 virtual influencer followers' online survey data were examined using structural equation modeling via SmartPLS. The results demonstrate that parasocial relations mediate between virtual influencer credibility (i.e., trustworthiness, expertise) and luxury fashion purchases. Also, perceived homophily mediates between a virtual influencer's attractiveness (i.e., Physical attraction, Familiarity, Likability, Similarity, Relevance) and luxury fashion purchase. The results highlight that social media followers/customers get attracted towards virtual influencers, and virtual influencers are perceived as attractive, familiar, similar, and related to customers' preferences, increasing luxury fashion purchases.

    "abstract": "Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a commonly used method for evaluating battery health. It involves applying a high-frequency excitation signal to the battery and analyzing the resulting voltage response to generate its impedance spectrum. Traditional EIS techniques generally treat the battery as a linear time-invariant system, assuming that, under small signal perturbations and resting conditions, the impedance spectrum reliably represents the battery’s behavior. However, this paper demonstrates that the presence of the battery’s opencircuit voltage (OCV) invalidates the LTI assumption, even when a zero-mean excitation signal is used on a fully rested battery. Specifically, we show that OCV variations introduce nonlinearity in the voltage response, significantly affecting the impedance spectrum in the low-frequency range. To address this limitation, we utilize a novel approach that helps remove the OCV’s contribution from the measured voltage response. This correction allows for a more precise impedance analysis by directly addressing the nonlinearity caused by the OCV. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using data from a battery simulator."

Through well-designed simulation experiments, a typical park integrated energy system is used as a simulation example to compare and analyse the operation results of the low-carbon economy-based optimal dispatch under two different system configurations. The results show that the design of the park integrated energy system based on the optimal scheduling of lowcarbon economy has significant advantages in cost control, which can effectively reduce the cost of power purchase and operation and maintenance costs, and in the improvement of energy efficiency, it can significantly enhance the stability of the energy supply, reduce the amount of abandoned power, improve the utilisation rate of renewable energy, and at the same time significantly reduce carbon emissions and other pollutants, which is significant for promoting the low-carbon transformation of the park.

    "abstract": "To implement frequency sensitivity in always-on audio-frontends that predominantly utilize analog signal processing techniques, banks of bandpass filters are needed. Due to their deployment in low-voltage environments, keeping all transistors in saturation under all conditions poses a challenge. We propose a common-mode feedback concept for flipped voltage follower based bandpass filters making use of the backgate terminal in SOI technologies. It sets the operating points of the filter core, ensuring proper functionality under all process variations and a temperature range from <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$-20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$</tex> to 85° C. We conducted a comprehensive mathematical analysis, deriving design guidelines for the common-mode feedback loops. The bandpass filter bank with the proposed common-mode feedback concept has been simulated and verified on schematic-level achieving a total power consumption of 64.3 nW and a DR of approximately 50 dB while covering a frequency range from 44 Hz to 7.8 kHz."

    "abstract": "It is of greatest significance to forecast the amount of crop a farmer will produce for effective agriculture and decision-making. The traditional techniques are based on history and mere calculations but may be unreliable since weather, soil, etc., are always changing. In this project, in this work, machine learning has been used to enhance crop yield forecasting based on history, weather, and soil. Different models like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting are experimented upon to decide on the optimal model to utilize. Among them, the best outcome is from the Decision Tree model. The calculations are also performed by the system, decide upon the key factors, and make the models optimize for enhanced performance. In this way, the farmers are able to plan effectively, utilize the resources effectively, minimize losses, and increase the harvest. We can then extend and evolve the system further with the addition of real-time data harvesting and the ability to accommodate a larger diversity of crops in numerous regions."

Overlooking mental health issues like anxiety, depression, or chronic stress can lead to inappropriate treatment, such as unnecessary cardiology referrals. This may increase the risk of serious complications, including stroke, heart attack, or kidney failure. To address this gap, this study proposes an intelligent referral recommendation system that integrates fuzzy logic with genetic algorithm (GA) optimization. The system analyzes both physical indicators (e.g., blood pressure, age, genetic factors) and psychological parameters (e.g., anxiety levels) to determine whether patients should be referred to a cardiologist or psychiatrist. By optimizing membership functions through GAs, the system improves the decision accuracy and minimizes referral errors. Experimental validation demonstrates that the proposed framework is capable of providing more precise and context-aware medical referrals."

    "abstract": "Phishing attacks led by email and text message intrusions along with deceptive hyperlinks continue to rise because they take advantage of user trust so organizations need strong novel protective strategies beyond basic defense systems. A detection system using advanced language model RoBERTa comes with a dynamic ensemble framework to perform phishing identification across different communication platforms. Our system uses RoBERTa to read text deeply through 30 indicators that feature URL properties (domain registration age and unusual top-level suffixes and hidden IP addresses) and textual indicators (urgent phrasing, questionable sender authenticity and inconsistent formatting including excessive punctuation). A distinctive neural network accepts these indicators to enhance RoBERTa’s results thus improving its capacity to detect malicious content from benign content with enhanced accuracy. Our approach solves the problem of unbalanced training data through the creation of synthetic examples using synonym substitutions which produces an improved model reliability as it combines legitimate and phishing samples. After its training phase the system offers an interface to users for flagging incorrect outcomes or verifying correct classifications so that it develops comprehension of genuine world scenarios through real-time inputs. The principle has passed demanding tests which have generated exceptional precision and recall results while surpassing conventional methods at detecting phishing attempts specifically in emails, text messages and web links. Through the combination of language processing technology with cyber-security experience the solution delivers an advanced barrier system to protect digital systems from modern phishing strategies which it actively adapts to new threats."

Using this model, clusters are more stable, overhead is reduced, and network lifetime is prolonged by minimising unnecessary re-clustering and even energy distribution.

Social proof, such as reviews, ratings, and endorsements from influencers, plays an important role in reducing users' uncertainty and encouraging their interest in trying a product or service. Meanwhile, direct experiences such as how easy the platform is to use, how well the service matches users' expectations, and the overall impression users get also have a significant impact on trust building. This research uses a quantitative approach with an online survey method. Of the total respondents collected, there were 399 respondents who met the criteria who were active users of Trave****. The results of this study highlight that building trust is not just about having a good reputation or strong social proof. Providing a smooth, reliable and satisfying user experience is equally important. A strong combination of social proof and positive firsthand experience creates a stronger foundation for long term user trust, making it important for digital platforms like Trave**** to focus on both aspects to remain competitive and relevant in the market."

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are gaining popularity in wireless communication networks due to their ability to manipulate the amplitude and phase of electromagnetic waves, directing them in a desired direction. This paper presents a comprehensive study on Bit Error Rate (BER) measurements under various wireless propagation conditions, focusing mainly on the impact of passive beamforming using RIS. Experiments were conducted in multipath conditions and in an anechoic chamber to minimize external interference and analyse the effects of multipath and reflection separately. Labview software and NI USRPs were used on both the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) sides. The experimental setup includes transmission and reception using horn antennas, through both direct paths and reflections off a metal surface. The metal surface is positioned in the anechoic chamber to ensure that it only reflects the signal incident from the horn antenna pointing towards it, while all other interferences are absorbed by the chamber’s absorbers. Results indicate that reflections from the metal plate in the anechoic chamber can provide an effective additional link to the existing direct line, thereby improving the received BER. Although the reflected link is longer than the direct link, at a frequency of 2.4 GHz frequency and an $\\mathrm{Eb} / \\mathrm{No}$ of 4 dB, the reflected link’s BER is $\\mathbf{1 2. 5 \\%}$ better than that of the direct link, indicating that the reflected link serves as a reasonably good signal copy even when the direct link is blocked. This also demonstrates the effective passive beamforming achieved through controlled reflection. Furthermore, configuring the entire setup within the anechoic chamber illustrates that the RIS-based reflection can steer the signal in a desired direction, achieving optimal BER at the desired angle. These findings validate the potential of RIS for enhancing the reliability of digital wireless communication."

    "abstract": "Solar energy is increasingly recognized as a vital substitute for traditional energy sources as global demand for sustainable power continues to grow. This need is especially critical in emerging nations, where many regions experience energy scarcity and remain reliant on expensive and environmentally damaging fossil fuels. To address this issue, this paper presents the design and development of an upgraded Smart Solar Battery Charging Station aimed at reducing dependency on conventional grids and delivering a cost-effective, environmentally sustainable power solution. The proposed system employs two 200-Watt photovoltaic panels to charge 48-Volt battery sets, ensuring a consistent energy supply throughout the day. A key innovation of the system is its adaptive switching mechanism, which seamlessly transitions to backup grid power during periods of insufficient solar irradiance. This feature enables continuous battery charging and enhances performance in regions with fluctuating sunlight or unstable grid access. One of the primary applications of the system is in the transportation sector, particularly for charging electric vehicles (EVs), thereby contributing to improved mobility. Beyond its direct functionality, the system promotes decentralized energy solutions, reduces carbon emissions, and enhances energy resilience-all in alignment with global renewable energy objectives. This study examines the system’s design, operation, and broader potential as a scalable and sustainable energy infrastructure for global communities."

This paper proposes a hybrid architecture PRNG and its carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNTFET) implementation. Firstly, this paper proposes a two-stage hybrid PRNG architecture that achieves excellent performance, strong randomness, and enhanced security. The first stage introduces a full-state jumping linear feedback shift register (LFSR), which effectively addresses the low throughput and poor randomness issues of traditional LFSRs. The second stage uses a lightweight optimized SM4 algorithm, which significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining strong nonlinear confusion capability. For the Si-based 180 nm process node, the design achieves a throughput of 43.1 Gbps, with 9× area efficiency and 6× energy efficiency improvements over similar solutions. Secondly, implemented in CNTFET 7 nm technology, the proposed PRNG achieves significant gains. Comprehensive analysis shows a 7.9x improvement in area efficiency and a 2.2x enhancement in energy efficiency based on logic synthesis results, compared to a Si 7 nm equivalent node.

    "abstract": "We study the instability of Nesterov’s ODE in non-conservative settings, where the driving term is not necessarily the gradient of a potential function. While convergence properties under Nesterov’s ODE are well-characterized for settings with gradient-based driving terms, we show that the presence of arbitrarily small non-conservative terms can lead to instability. To resolve the instability issue, we study a regularization mechanism based on restarting. For this mechanism, we establish novel explicit bounds on the resetting period that ensure the decrease of a suitable Lyapunov function, thereby guaranteeing stability and “accelerated” convergence rates under suitable smoothness and monotonicity properties on the driving term. Numerical simulations support our results."

    "abstract": "To address the challenges of feature extraction and complex signal fusion in the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery involving multi-channel non-stationary time-varying signals, an intelligent diagnosis model based on wavelet transform and graph causal convolution network is proposed. This model jointly represents the spatial topological relationship and temporal dynamic characteristics of multi-channel time-varying signals. In the spatial dimension, the model quantifies the similarity among multi-channel signals through multi-scale wavelet decomposition to construct spatial subgraphs, and uses graph convolution to complete multi-channel feature fusion. In the time dimension, a causal convolution network is used to perform convolution operations on the spatial subgraphs of consecutive time steps to deeply explore the dynamic evolution patterns of the signals. Comparative experiments on two typical non-stationary time-varying signal datasets, show that the proposed model demonstrates significant advantages under different signal-to-noise ratios."

    "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential across various scientific and engineering disciplines, including computational electromagnetics (CEM). While commonly used techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation and non-intrusive polynomial chaos (NIPC) expansion methods provide valuable insights about UQ in CEM, they often face the curse of dimensionality, rendering them computationally expensive in high-dimensional problems. In contrast, the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) is a well-established, structured and widely accepted framework for evaluating uncertainty in measurements. This paper introduces a novel approach for tackling UQ in CEM by integrating GUM principles. It is exemplified by application of UQ for specific absorption rate (SAR) calculations. By thoroughly analyzing distinct sources of uncertainty and incorporating input correlations, this method is shown to be a computationally efficient alternative to traditional UQ techniques. Leveraging the law of propagation of uncertainty, the proposed approach not only reduces computational costs but also maintains the accuracy and interpretability of UQ results."

SMC influences plant growth and nutrient bioavailability, while soil pH regulates microbial activity, nutrient solubility and overall soil fertility. Given their significance, developing precise, efficient, and real-time sensing technologies is essential. This work introduces a novel microstrip line-integrated spiral resonator-based planar sensor with a truncated ground, engineered for high-sensitivity soil dielectric characterization. The sensor, specifically designed to operate at 2.4 GHz, is evaluated by examining its transmission coefficient (S<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">12</sub>), with emphasis on frequency displacement and variations in S<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">12</sub> magnitude under loaded conditions. Experimental validation confirms that the sensor reliably estimates dielectric constant (∈ʹ<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><sub>r</sub></i>) from 1 to 15 and loss tangent between 0 and 0.2. Using these parameters, it quantifies SMC within 0%-20% with a low error of ±0.8%. For pH detection, two second-order polynomial models are employed, producing outputs for acidic (pH:3-6) and alkaline (pH:8-10) ranges relative to neutrality (pH=7). Thus, rather than providing a unique pH value, the sensor effectively indicates the degree of deviation from neutral soil conditions, demonstrating suitability for precision agriculture and environmental monitoring."

    "abstract": "Traditional machine learning based WiFi fingerprinting localization relies on pre-collected radio maps of the environment, which requires large data set for traning. However, it is difficult and time consuming to construct such data set in completely unknown environments. In this paper, we propose a bi-directional particle filter (Bi-PF) that achieves localization with a single walking data, requiring no prior knowledge of radio maps or environmental geometry. The Bi-PF contains two phases, which are forward and backward particle filters (FPF and BPF). In the FPF, the target is collecting the ranging information from WiFi APs, base stations or BLE tags, together with IMU data. We employ a virtual map to record the target trajectory based on the IMU data. Then, the pseudo-anchors, e.g., WiFi APs, are located on the virtual map according to the target trajectory. In the BPF, we fuse the IMU data and the ranging information from anchors to track the target on the virtual map. Experimental results indicate that the average error in real-world scenarios can reach under 3 m, while simulations with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) achieve 1 m. Even with limited available data, its tracking accuracy outperforms fingerprint-based positioning technologies, which can provide useful location based service for users."

    "abstract": "Bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) is a core task in multilingual natural language processing (NLP) that aims to generate cross-lingual word representations between languages. However, previous works often treat words as individual and isolated entities, neglecting the topological relationships both within a single embedding space (intra-space) and across different embedding spaces (inter-space). This restriction makes it difficult to match words from distinct language pairs with diverse topological structures, especially when the assumption of isomorphism between language spaces does not hold. Additionally, the quality of word representations is often compromised by noise introduced during insufficient pre-training of models, resulting in unstable and inaccurate BLI outcomes. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework, named Structure-Aware Dual Adversarial Autoencoder (SA-DAAE), which explicitly captures diverse topological structure information and improves language alignment in an unsupervised manner. In the model, two lightweight graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are first utilized to discover intra-space topological correlations within monolingual embedding spaces and then generate refined embedding representations. Next, a dual denoising autoencoder (DAE) module is introduced to remove noise from the embeddings and explore inter-space topological structures, facilitating the initial alignment of two languages into a shared latent space. To further refine the coarse-grained alignment, we design a pairwise embedding fine-tuning (PEF) strategy, which operates independently of the global isomorphic assumption and enables word-specific transformations in a fully unsupervised manner. Through extensive experiments on several datasets across fifteen language pairs, comprising both low and high isomorphic relationships, we demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of SA-DAAE."

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Vehicle Profiling-aware Federated Low-rank Adaptation (VPFLA) framework that achieves communication-efficient Personalized FL (PFL) based on CAV characteristics. A Vehicle Profiling (VP) module transforms CAV characteristics into profile vectors, which will assist the Federated Low-rank Adaptation (FLORA) module to separate global and local knowledge through LoRA with low communication overhead. Moreover, the VPFLA framework uses profile vectors and accuracy feedback to adaptively balance knowledge coordination among CAVs. Simulation results show that the proposed VPFLA achieves 95.97% accuracy with up to 99.97% reduction in communication overhead, validating its effectiveness in IoVs."

Creating similar swarm intelligence in engineered robots poses challenges to the design of collaborative algorithms that can be programmed at large scales. The assignment-based method has played an eminent role for a very long time in solving collaboration problems of robot swarms. However, it faces fundamental limitations in terms of efficiency and robustness due to its unscalability to swarm variants. This article presents a tutorial review on recent advances in assignment-free collaboration of robot swarms, focusing on the problem of shape formation. A key theoretical component is the recently developed <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">mean-shift exploration</i> strategy, which improves the collaboration efficiency of large-scale swarms by dozens of times. Further, the efficiency improvement is more significant as the swarm scale increases. Finally, this article discusses three important applications of the mean-shift exploration strategy, including precise shape formation, area coverage formation, and maneuvering formation, as well as their corresponding industrial scenarios in smart warehousing, area exploration, and cargo transportation."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a single-phase ac power supplied dual inverter integrated with a rectifier to enhance the output voltage of motor drive systems. The proposed dual inverter combines the topology of a dual inverter with a common dc bus and a four-leg inverter. The proposed configuration achieves a higher output voltage than conventional motor drive systems under an ac power supply while requiring fewer power devices than conventional dual inverters. In addition, a phase control method is introduced to suppress the modulation index at specific electrical frequencies. The proposed control method maintains a constant phase difference between the input voltage phase and the electrical angle of the motor by slightly adjusting the rotor speed reference. Experimental results show that the proposed dual inverter performs both rectification and motor drive operations, achieving a source power factor of 99.6% while controlling the rotor speed to 1700 rpm. The proposed phase control reduces the amplitude of the voltage reference by up to 55.0 % when the electrical frequency is equal to the source frequency; however, the proposed control method increases the torque ripple by 40 %. Consequently, the proposed dual inverter improves the inverter output voltage in single-phase ac power-supplied motor drive systems."

    "abstract": "This study examines how brand owners use blockchain technology to address the challenges posed by gray market activities under demand uncertainty. First, by utilizing blockchain's downward traceability feature, the brand can precisely track the flow and quantities of gray market products. Then, using real-time updated product information, smart penalty contracts are employed to penalize gray marketer, thereby mitigating the impact of gray market invasion. Within a dual-distribution model, we find that the retailer's gray market behavior in the low-price market harms the high-price market retailer. However, the brand may benefit from the gray market when the market size disparity is large and the proportion of loyal consumers in the high-price market is relatively low. Blockchain adoption effectively reduces the gray market scale, thus benefiting the high-price retailer, particularly when market size disparity is relatively high. Research shows that when blockchain cost and penalty fees meet certain conditions, blockchain can achieve a win-win-win situation for the brand and both retailers. Crucially, higher demand variance strengthens the brand's willingness to adopt blockchain to combat gray market. The results also show that excessive blockchain cost would reduce the brand's willingness to adopt, consumer surplus, and social welfare. However, lower demand variance or a higher proportion of loyal consumers expands the conditions under which blockchain can enhance social welfare."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of the new energy sector, production equipment for battery cells faces increasing challenges in maintaining efficiency and quality. Among these, the laser die cutting and winding machine plays a pivotal role in transforming electrode sheets into finished cells. Its performance directly affects the dimensional precision and internal structural consistency of the cells, which are critical to product quality and production-line efficiency. To tackle the challenges in monitoring and maintaining this critical equipment, we propose a time-series data-driven method based on the Transformer architecture, named multiscale dynamic dilated attention, which effectively predicts sensor offset trajectories and provides early shutdown fault warnings when correction sensors approach their operational limits. Furthermore, this model incorporates adjustable segment sizes and counts, and assigns distinct dilation rates to individual attention heads, this design enables a dynamic tradeoff among receptive field, modeling capacity, and computational cost, allowing fine-grained control over long-range dependence modeling while reducing the canonical self-attention complexity from <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$O(\\mathit {L}^{2})$</tex-math></inline-formula> to approximately <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$O(\\mathit {L})$</tex-math></inline-formula>.

To address this, we adopted a bottom-up Research through Design approach, a Reflexive Design Studio: as a design team, we created and reflected on conceptual designs using the mushroom basket as a metaphor to explore human–non-human relationalities. From these, we articulated roles (e.g., humans as materials, non-humans as co-makers) and purposes (e.g., activism, collective survival, approximation) that illustrate how MtH design might be practiced with nuances. Relating these to theory and prior work, we contribute an exploratory framework offering generative and critical starting points for future MtH design research to test, contest, expand, and engage with MtH complexities in practice."

While implementations at the intersection of HCI and ASC mostly represent weak signals, there is a need for anticipatory research to explore the possible implications of digitally induced altered states of consciousness (DIAL). To address this, we adopted the Futures Clinique method to map out DIAL-related sociotechnical imaginaries through two futures workshops, capturing collective anticipations expressed in narrative scenarios created by participants. These scenarios were then analysed using reflexive thematic analysis, revealing common themes and relationships between them across groups and implementations. The themes were categorised into three areas: (1) the societal functions of DIAL technologies, (2) the citizen types (\"Subjects\") shaped by DIAL, and (3) the societal tensions and contradictions arising around their use. Additionally, to explore the relationships between these themes we used network visualisation. This work contributes to the HCI field by providing the first study of its kind to explore the collective anticipations relate to futures of DIAL through participatory workshops. Furthermore, the emergent framework offers a broader contribution to HCI by providing a blueprint for portraying the implications of emerging technologies through collaborative speculation."

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an event-driven alternative with sparse activations enabling ultra‑low‑power operation. Studies explore hybrid architectures combining the sparse, event‑driven dynamics of SNNs with Transformer attention mechanisms to retain performance. However, there is no systematic evaluation methodology for these Spike-Driven Transformer. In this paper, we introduce a unified evaluation flow for the Spike-Driven Transformer that integrates memory-access and compute-energy modeling across four operations in the Spiking Transformer Block (STB): Matrix Multiplication, Batch Normalization, Leaky Integration-and-Fire activation, and Residual connection. Besides, a two-level dataflow-energy co-optimization for MM in STB inference assesses inner reuse strategies (weight-, output-, and input-stationary) alongside outer loop orderings. Experiments on ImageNet-scale workloads reveal that combining inner output stationary IOS (inner output-stationary) flow with outer loop orderings OOS (outer output-stationary) minimizes energy and latency. Compared with the real hardware, only 4.6% power inconsistency of our evaluation is calculated. Our methodology establishes the first end-to-end energy-dataflow co-optimization foundation for Spike-Driven Transformers and delivers insights for the design of ultra-low-power neuromorphic accelerators."

    "abstract": "This study evaluates six machine learning models in sentiment analysis on e-commerce consumer reviews from three leading cosmetic brands. Among these, SVM, Naive Bayes and Random Forest are the most widely used conventional models in recent years, despite exhibiting certain limitations when processing sparse and non-linear text data. While gradient boosting models (XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM) have demonstrated superior performance across various domains, their effectiveness in e-commerce sentiment analysis remains under-explored. To address this gap, this study compares these models to identify the most effective approach for sentiment analysis on e-commerce consumer reviews. The results indicate that SVM achieved the highest accuracy and F1 score, while CatBoost and LightGBM also exhibit robust performance under computational constraints. In addition, NMF-based topic modeling is applied to extract key product attributes that are frequently mentioned across different sentiment polarities. This combined approach not only enhances our understanding of consumer emotional responses but also provides actionable insights for product innovation and marketing strategies in the competitive beauty and personal care market."

Multi-omics data, including gene expression, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression, offers potential for identifying distinct cancer subtypes but is often high-dimensional and incomplete. Conventional methods relying on imputation or sample exclusion risk losing critical biological information [10]. This paper proposes a robust framework using Multiple Similarity Network Embedding (MSNE) to integrate incomplete multi-omics data without imputation. By constructing similarity networks with Gaussian kernels, normalizing local neighborhoods, and fusing them into a unified graph, patient embeddings are generated via random walks and clustered using unsupervised algorithms. Evaluated on a dataset with 30% simulated missingness, the approach achieves high-quality clusters (Silhouette=0.595, NMI=0.710 for k = 3), demonstrating robustness and advancing precision oncology."

Addressing this gap, Model-Driven DevOps with AI (MDDOAI) introduces a model-to-code solution that bridges the abstraction gap between design and deployment. It leverages Atlas Transformation Language (ATL) for model-to-model transformation and Acceleo for code generation, enabling the automated synthesis of deployable CI/CD pipeline configurations. The resulting prototype demonstrates the feasibility of scalable, model-driven automation in DevOps, offering a structured foundation for future extensible and maintainable pipeline engineering."

This work presents a blockchain-based architecture integrated with a decentralized private IPFS cluster storage system to ensure dynamic, privacy-preserved, tamper-proof document exchange and real time tracing of the related transactions across supply chain stakeholders. By leveraging Ethereum based smart contract, the system facilitates shipment validations, and delivery confirmations without intermediaries, while the AES encrypted documents are stored off-chain using IPFS to reduce blockchain bloat and enhance scalability. Users joining the platform automatically contribute to the storage network by hosting IPFS nodes, ensuring decentralized participation. The inclusion of end-to-end encryption using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) strengthens data authenticity and confidentiality during transmission. The stakeholders are allowed to connect and disconnect from the network dynamically without any centralized authority in a plug and play fashion. The system ensures immutable recordkeeping, real-time access to critical data, and improved trust among entities such as shippers, carriers, customs, and financial institutions. This approach addresses key challenges such as data traceability, secure access, and compliance reporting, offering a robust, scalable, and future-ready solution for modern logistics and cross-border trade documentation. By uniting blockchain and decentralized storage, the architecture promotes operational resilience, auditability, and seamless collaboration across the global supply chain.

Neural camera, signal processor, memory are independent components which interact without the knowledge of authenticity of incoming data. Different image formats with lossy and lossless compression are beyond the scope of functional verification. The proposed methodology offers a transaction tracker with metadata extractor to validate performance of neural camera network, data integrity and other criteria through entire transaction pipeline. The results show significant improvement in error detection, verification time and quality metrics compared to conventional methods. The experimental setup, results and conclusions have been derived with a special reference to automotive use-case but the same can also be implemented over any neural camera application."

Based on this analysis, we implemented a new custom kernel to offload the Q6_K operations to the hardware. In previous work, this operation was processed on the host CPU. This targeted optimization reduced the end-to-end latency by approximately 11%. Furthermore, an evaluation of a projected ASIC implementation showed that the absolute performance does not match that of a GPU.

It enables the optimization of production, distribution, and consumption while addressing challenges such as reliance on intermittent renewable energy sources, load uncertainty, and power system complexity. Optimal management of hybrid power systems for military sites is crucial because it improves system efficiency, survivability, and stability making the military facility more energy self-sufficient and less dependent on external utilities. Therefore, we intend by this research to suggest an optimal design and sizing of a multi-source power plant that can effectively empower a military base. For this reason, HOMER Pro software was employed not only to provide the optimal design and sizing of the hybrid power plant but also to assess the technical and economic feasibility of the suggested power system. Moreover, we studied the power management of the suggested power plant such as load forecasting, power generation and power storage scheduling, and power exchange with the commercial grid. For load forecasting, we have provided two different approaches: the first one by minutiousely combining several standards load profiles of Homer and then by defining a Machine Learning approach using Linear Regression models. Besides, for power generation management, we have provided a flowchart-based algorithm that allows a day-ahead scheduling of power generation, power storage and power exchange.

The curated data includes 2548 glioma photos, 2658 pituitary images, 2582 meningioma images, and 2500 non-tumor images. We added the Convolutional-Block-Attention-Module(CBAM) attention mechanism to YOLOv7 to improve feature extraction and highlight brain cancer-related regions. Used Spatial-Pyramid-Pooling-Fast+ (SPPF+) layer to the network's fundamental infrastructure to improve model sensitivity. With decoupled heads, YOLOv7 can quickly gain insights from a range of sources. Another feature is Bidirectional. Pyramid Network (BiFPN) speeds multi-scale feature fusion and improves tumor feature collection. The results show that our strategy is more effective than state-of-the-art tumor detection models.

As a result, this study presents a novel artificial intelligence-based system that uses a mix of machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing to predict criminal activities. It uses a variety of data sources, including social media, socioeconomic factors, past crime reports, CCTV video, and others, to generate real-time forecasts of where crime is most likely to occur. The suggested solution, which merges CNN and RNN, improves the accuracy of predictions and boosts the techniques employed in law enforcement. These indicate that crime rates in high-risk regions have decreased by 15%, police response times have decreased by 35%, and the accuracy of predictions has decreased by 28%. Consequently, this technology has the ability to change the way that crime is prevented in cities across India by using a data-driven and proactive approach to policing. In addition, it will improve public safety and make better use of scarce resources."

This process helps in dividing letters into different units from a captured image or scanned documents, which becomes input for character recognition steps. For the VANPR system, character segmentation is one of the key steps; wrong segmentation of characters can lead to the fetching of wrong vehicle information. Current challenges in character segmentation are noise and distortion of the captured image, images having to touch and overlapping characters, images of variable fonts and handwriting styles, and skewed and curved texts of the character images. These challenges have made character segmentation a very attractive topic of research lately. The models used in this area have evolved from traditional methods such as the Projection-based method in the 1990s to machine learning-based models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forests in the 2010s. Recent works from 2015 have focused more on deep learning-based methods such as FCN, R-CNN, and RNN, which are extensively used in the VANPR system."

    "abstract": "The “Intelligent System for Harmful Light Detection,” branded as OptiGuard, addresses the escalating concern of harmful light exposure stemming from prolonged interaction with digital devices and artificial lighting systems. T his research presents a robust and comprehensive solution that combines pre-cision light sensors (GUVA-S12SD and TSL2561) with advanced machine learning algorithms to detect and mitigate exposure to blue light, ultraviolet (UV), and infrared (IR) radiation in real-time. Numerous studies have established links between chronic exposure to these light types and adverse health effects such as digital eye strain, circadian rhythm disruption, sleep disorders, and long-term retinal degeneration. OptiGuard employs a high-performing Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model trained on real-world exposure datasets to classify harmful light levels with high precision. The system delivers personalized risk assess-ments by integrating multiple contextual factors, including user demographics (such as age and glasses usage), ambient light characteristics, and historical exposure patterns. The real-time data acquisition is managed through an ESP32 microcontroller that collects sensor data and communicates with a Flask-based Python backend. This backend handles data preprocessing, intelligent harm classification, and seamless communication with a cross-platform Flutter-based frontend. The frontend interface presents users with real-time insights, including UV, visible, and IR inten-sity levels, cumulative exposure durations, glasses detection status using Mediapipe and OpenCV, and harm-level alerts through an engaging and intuitive UI. The system architecture supports dynamic light pattern recognition and contextual awareness, enabling adaptive behavior according to varying environmental lighting conditions and user habits. Additionally, OptiGuard supports long-term data logging and visual trend analytics, allowing users to reflect on their exposure history and modify their usage behavior accordingly. Experimental validation has been conducted across diverse indoor and outdoor lighting scenarios, with consistent results demonstrating the system’s accuracy, responsiveness, and practical usability. OptiGuard is designed for both wearable and static use cases, making it versatile for individuals, workplaces, and health-conscious environments. This work represents a significant advancement over existing methods by providing an intelligent, proactive, and user-tailored solution to mitigate ocular risks, contributing to improved digital wellness in our increasingly screen-centric world. The modular architecture also opens pathways for future integration with smart home ecosystems, wearable health monitors, and AI-driven behavioral coaching tools. Overall, OptiGuard exemplifies the convergence of embedded systems, data science, and human-centric design in solving modern digital health challenges."

Many ML algorithmshave been integrated into multisource decision support applications to improve analysis performance and prediction. Due to the widespread usage of ML in critical decision processes (e.g., distributed and collaborative autonomous systems, air traffic controlapplications), there is an exponential growth in adversarial data manipulations that target the ML algorithms and consequently influence their decision process in favoring the attackers.In this paper, we present a methodology to self-protect the ML system as opposed to the traditional usage of ML system in security for a wide range of applications in commercial markets. We propose a resilient ML Ensemble (rMLe) architecture that ensures the ML system's resilient operations from ML attacks. The rMLe architecture leverages Moving Target Defense (MTD) and Data Anonymized Transformation (DAT) to change the ML algorithms and the training datasets used in the ML pipeline, thus ensuring resilience to adversarial ML attacks. Our experimental results and evaluations show that the rMLe can tolerate ML adversarial attacks with high accuracy and low false alarms."

The proposed method was trained and validated on the publicly available MicSigv1 dataset from the Cotopaxi volcano. The best model using a ten-fold cross-validation strategy achieved a mean of F1score, accuracy, precision, recall, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve scores of $0.959,0.959,0.960$, 0.959, and 0.970 in the training phase and $0.965,0.964,0.966$, 0.964, and 0.979 in the test phase, respectively.

    "abstract": "Recent trends in AI-assisted design and new approaches to accelerate overall design processes are contributing to the increasing complexity of System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. Unfortunately, advancement in verification methods has not kept pace, leading to a widening verification gap. This gap underscores the growing importance of reusing verification components. Although reusing components at the testbench level is possible, the portability of verification tests and scenarios in complex SoC integrations remains inadequate and underexplored. The Portable Stimulus Standard (PSS) aims to enhance reuse through a model-based approach, where Portable Models (PMs) capture the intent of verification tests in a significantly more abstract manner. Although transitioning to this higher level of abstraction is promising, it still entails a considerable manual burden, even when utilizing PSS. PMs connect to the Design Under Verification (DUV) via realization-layer bindings, which may vary as one moves from a module-level to a SoC-level context. The authors propose an automation approach, represented in their unique toolchain based on static analysis, that facilitates the binding of modular PMs to a top-level PM. This paper demonstrates the application of this toolchain in a full SoC integration context, using a Keccak cryptographic accelerator integrated through both loosely coupled and tightly coupled architectures as the DUV. The study illustrates that static analysis can support vertical reuse across multiple design hierarchy levels. However, as integration reaches the SoC scale, it increasingly intersects with software-driven control and structural encapsulation, necessitating additional modeling efforts. These findings define the limitations of structural automation for vertical reuse and outline directions for enhancing methodologies and tool support for SoCscale verification."

    "abstract": "Skin disorders are one of the most often diagnosed conditions among the mass population, but because of their visual similarity and need for specialized knowledge, it is still challenging to identify them quickly and correctly. In this work, we have built a deep learning model for the classification of skin disease using pre-trained neural network architectures such as EfficientNet B0, VGG16, and ResNet-50. The model has been trained on a selected dataset from Kaggle and other public datasets that comprise eight different classes. In our experiment, EfficientNetB0 has given the best performance in terms of accuracy, achieving a test accuracy of 97.86% and training accuracy of 99.93% with minimal loss. The results have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of using lightweight pre-trained networks for dermatological image classification. This technique will help dermatologists establish accurate diagnoses, especially in remote or undeveloped areas."

UASs are being used for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), coordinated air and ground mobility, counter-UAS, attritable assets, and more. In contested environments, GPS and RF communications are often restricted or denied, driving the need for greater autonomy. Such autonomy requires navigation that includes obstacle avoidance and path finding. Current computing technology for autonomy and inference for a vast majority of neural network models uses nVidia’s Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). However, the payload on a UAS is limited and therefore, low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) solutions that deliver low latency, high throughput autonomy processing are desired. The present paper details neuromorphics as a viable solution to the SWaP and latency needs for UAS autonomy."

Conventional diagnos-tic techniques frequently depend on expert interpretation and clinical testing, which can be time-consuming and necessitate a high level of medical competence. The proposed work in this manuscript provides a deep learning-based method for classifying diabetes as either healthy or unhealthy using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A structured dataset comprising important medical parameters like insulin, glucose levels, BMI, and other pertinent biomarkers is used to train the algorithm. The CNN architecture is tuned with the right layers, activation functions, and regularization algorithms to guarantee great accuracy. The suggested model shows promise as a dependable method for automated diabetes detection with a classification accuracy of 96 % following extensive training and validation.

FlashAttention mitigates these issues by reducing memory overhead via fused kernels and online softmax while preserving exact attention; however, its applicability to low-power accelerators remains unexplored. This work adapts FlashAttention to IMAX3, a coarse-grained linear array (CGLA) architecture optimized for high-throughput, energy-efficient processing. The matrix multiplication bottleneck is offloaded to IMAX3 with a blocked computation scheme and data layouts tailored to its 512 KiB on-chip memory, minimizing off-chip data transfers. Experimental results on CPU, GPU, and IMAX3 show that FlashAttention on IMAX3 achieves a 3–5× speedup over standard Attention on the same hardware. For short sequence lengths, IMAX3 outperforms an RTX 4090 GPU in energy–delay product, demonstrating its potential for low-power generative AI acceleration."

However, effective seizure detection is possible when using classifiers trained individually for each patient (subject-dependent approach). In this study, EEG signal features were extracted and selected, followed by classification using three machine learning methods: k-NN, SVM, and Random Forest. The average values of metrics such as sensitivity, precision, and F1-score ranged from 80–46%, 61–42%, and 55–48%, respectively.

A D Flip Flop is an essential part of digital circuits, used to store and transfer data. Optical circuits, such as those using photonic crystals, offer higher speeds and smaller dimensions compared to traditional electronic circuits. Photonic crystals, with their alternating dielectric structures, create photonic band gaps (PBGs) that block specific light frequencies, essential for designing advanced logic circuits. The focus of this work is on designing an all-optical D flip-flop using photonic crystals.The design aims to create a compact, high-speed flip-flop, reducing errors and enhancing performance by utilizing photonic crystal structures with small dimensions and high accuracy. Optical computing, which uses light (photons) instead of electricity (electrons) for data processing and communication, has transformative potential in data centers. Its has several applications such as Data Storage and Retrieval, AI and Machine Learning Acceleration,, Encryption and Security in Data Centers. The proposed structure uses silicon rods in air substrate and is designed to work with the $\\mathbf{1. 5 5} \\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\mathbf{m}$ wavelength commonly used in telecommunications. The design is proposed to be simple without the use of any non linear materials and acheived a contrast ratio of 10.5 dB and a low response time of 0.32 ps."

    "abstract": "Using emerging technology IoT, we can connect a huge number of physical objects and can transfer their current or functional data to the server automatically without any human intervention. As the data are unbiased in nature it is very effective for user analysis. In IoT, many sensors, actuators, and processing devices are required to get the information. And if we install these devices then challenges come in how we interconnect with them and how we transfer the data from one device to another. So again it is a very big challenge in the field of IoT and the second thing is that when we communicate in an open area most of the agricultural land is open yard. So to transfer the data in this open yard with multiple devices is again a difficult task. So because of these reasons in our proposed work, we design an ad-hoc network in which each sensor is treated as a transceiver unit, that is it can send the data to the server or receive the data from the server as well as also act as a networking device that can work as a communication agent. It means that any sensor X can connect to the other connected sensor which acts as an intermediate sensor between any new sensor and the server, the data collected by the new sensor can be sent to the server. So in the proposed work, we implemented a routing algorithm that explains how the data can transfer from one location to another location in an ad-hoc manner. The time complexity is around 20 ms and it is physically implemented and tested using 6 devices."

A Barrett-based modular reduction enhances power efficiency, while an iterative transformation method minimizes hardware area. Performance analysis on the Artix-7 FPGA in two frequency ranges (10–40MHz and 100–250MHz) demonstrates a balanced trade-off between area-time product and power-performance-area efficiencies.

    "abstract": "With the ever-increasing use of social media by teenagers, mental health providers, welfare specialists, and platform developers are increasingly worried about the prevalence of social media addiction. Thanks to ubiquitous internet access, cheap data plans, and mobile devices, these younger users—sometimes called digital naives—have unrestricted access to social media. But they don't know nearly enough about the root causes, effects, and effective mitigation tactics for problematic use. Data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training make up the three stages of the proposed approach for detecting social media addiction. To enhance the quality of the data, text preparation methods are used. To overcome the shortcomings of the conventional BoW model, a new feature selection method called BWF is introduced, which combines BoW and Word2Vec. In order to build a classifier ensemble, they first employ a domain-specific feature selection procedure and base our classifiers on RBFSVM. With a classification accuracy of 95.52%, the suggested RBFSV hybrid technique surpasses individual models. These findings prove that the model may successfully identify problematic patterns of social media use among adolescents. Insights gained from the study can help parents and platform providers develop more effective interventions to lessen the effects of social media addiction."

Body Fat Percentage (BFP) is very important for accurate prediction of obesity, especially in cases like Normal Weight Disorder where metrics like BMI lose accuracy. BFP measurement techniques are unfeasible and often inaccurate. Due to this, a machine learning model has been devised to allow easy-to-deploy measurement model to be implemented for routine checks without need for expensive measurements or exposure to radiation. The model was trained on the bodyfat prediction dataset, consisting of 252 entries. This data consisted mostly of anthropometric measurements such as waist, height, abdomen and body density, which have not been used as a feature. The impact of data preprocessing, outlier removal using IsolationForest, feature engineering, feature selection, model training and ensemble methods have been discussed. The best model was stacked ensemble which showed R2 of 0.7943 and RMSE of 3.6950."

These insights can guide feature selection when extending the approach to larger networks. Results show the model achieves high prediction accuracy and remains robust under load increases and line contingency.

Combining GA-PSO enhances the prediction accuracy for both univariate and multivariate resource usage, with a focus on CPU and memory usage.

    "abstract": "Density peak clustering is an effective and interpretable method for uncovering potential knowledge in unlabeled datasets with arbitrary shapes. It has been extensively studied by researchers, and a series of extended models have been proposed. The performances of these algorithms largely depend on the positions and number of cluster centers. However, accurately selecting these centers remains a challenging problem. Therefore, to address this issue, an adaptive density distribution clustering (ADDC) method based on graph theory and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$</tex-math> </inline-formula>-nearest neighbors is developed in this study. ADDC is a decentralized and robust clustering approach, which consists of three main components. First, an undirected neighborhood graph is constructed based on the neighbor degree defined in this article to implement a decentralized allocation strategy. Second, componentwise local density is introduced, and a new criterion for selecting density peaks is established to serve as one of the guidelines for determining the number of clusters. Third, with the neighborhood graph and density peaks, criterion-based decomposition and fusion strategies are formulated to identify clusters with multiple peaks or to detect low-density clusters without peaks. Finally, experiments and comparisons on widely used real datasets and synthetic datasets demonstrated that ADDC significantly outperforms five classical clustering methods and seven state-of-the-art density-based cluster approaches."

We begin by presenting two key results concerning matrices over general fields F with characteristic char(F) ≠ 2, which involve the construction of self-adjoint τ-monomial matrices from any invertible self-adjoint matrix.

    "abstract": "Inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) can perform high-resolution imaging of non-cooperative targets around the clock and in all weather conditions, which has been widely used in the military field. The mechanism of centralized decision-making and multi-station observation enables the radar network to complete the multi-target ISAR imaging task. A reasonable task allocation solution can give full play to the resources flexibility of radar network, enabling it to efficiently complete imaging tasks in complex electromagnetic environments. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based evolutionary method (DRL-EM) for multi-target imaging task allocation in radar network under concomitant suppression jamming. First, a task allocation model for multi-target ISAR imaging for radar network under concomitant suppression jamming is constructed. Then, a task allocation optimization method that integrates the environment understanding mechanism of deep reinforcement learning and the search and optimization capability of evolutionary method is proposed. Numerical experiments have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm has a faster convergence rate, and the resulting final task allocation solution is more reasonable with a higher utility value."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of the low-altitude economy (LAE) has significantly increased the utilization of autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) in various applications, necessitating efficient and secure communication methods among AAV swarms. In this work, we aim to introduce distributed collaborative beamforming (DCB) into AAV swarms and handle the eavesdropper collusion by controlling the corresponding signal distributions. Specifically, we consider a two-way DCB-enabled aerial communication between two AAV swarms and construct these swarms as two AAV virtual antenna arrays. Then, we minimize the two-way known secrecy capacity and maximum sidelobe level to avoid information leakage from the known and unknown eavesdroppers, respectively. Simultaneously, we also minimize the energy consumption of AAVs when constructing virtual antenna arrays. Due to the conflicting relationships between secure performance and energy efficiency, we consider these objectives by formulating a multi-objective optimization problem, which is NP-hard and with a large number of decision variables. Accordingly, we design a novel generative swarm intelligence (GenSI) framework to solve the problem with less overhead, which contains a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE)-based generative method and a proposed powerful swarm intelligence algorithm. In this framework, CVAE can collect expert solutions obtained by the swarm intelligence algorithm in other environment states to explore characteristics and patterns, thereby directly generating high-quality initial solutions in new environment factors for the swarm intelligence algorithm to search solution space efficiently. Simulation results show that the proposed swarm intelligence algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline algorithms, and the GenSI can achieve similar optimization results by using far fewer iterations than the ordinary swarm intelligence algorithm. Experimental tests demonstrate that introducing the CVAE mechanism achieves a 58.7% reduction in execution time, which enables the deployment of GenSI even on AAV platforms with limited computing power."

    "abstract": "Urban traffic congestion is becoming increasingly complex, necessitating innovative solutions for adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC). The multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework offers a promising approach by enabling coordinated decision-making across multiple intersections. However, in large-scale scenarios, more intersections worsen issues like poor credit assignment and low data efficiency, degrading performance. In this paper, we introduce the Traffic Sequence Transformer (TrafSeqFormer), a novel MARL-based framework that leverages sequence modeling for cooperative traffic signal control. TrafSeqFormer incorporates an encoder-decoder architecture for actor and critic networks and applies the Multi-Agent Advantage Decomposition Theorem to transform the joint policy search in multi-intersection traffic control into a sequential decision-making process. Using auto-regressive action generation and self-attention, TrafSeqFormer improves credit assignment, data efficiency, and agent collaboration, enhancing scalability for real-world traffic systems. We compare TrafSeqFormer to both MARL and domain-specific baselines. In synthetic traffic networks, it reduces queue length by up to 83%, increases throughput by 15%, and cuts delay by 65%. In real-world datasets from Beijing, Hangzhou, and Jinan, TrafSeqFormer further reduces queue length by 27% and delay by 73.7%, consistently outperforming competitive baselines across diverse urban scenarios."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system that utilizes multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar for beam training and tracking in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication environments. The ISAC system is based on the dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) technique, where the base station generates and tracks beams using radar echoes instead of relying on communication signals. To achieve accurate two-dimensional (2D) direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, we propose an off-grid structured Sparse Bayesian Learning (2D-OGSSBL) algorithm that exploits the joint sparsity structure between the grid component and the bias component, as well as among different snapshots. By leveraging the estimated DOAs from echoes, we further introduce a downlink beamforming and beam tracking method, which utilizes the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound of the proposed DOA estimation algorithm to optimize the beamforming design. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves high DOA estimation accuracy even with a coarse sampling grid. Additionally, numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed DOA estimation algorithm and ISAC beamforming scheme, highlighting the advantages of incorporating sensing functionality in communication beamforming compared to other beamforming schemes that rely on auxiliary information."

However, microfluidic chips mostly need a peristaltic pump to provide pressure to feed the sample, which limits its capability of immediate detection as well as portability. In this paper, a gravity-driven droplet-based microfluidic multiplexed Raman sensor has been developed, which is applicable to both rigid and flexible substrates. Furthermore, the fabrication method is also proposed. The developed gravity-driven multiplexed Raman sensor is easy to manufacture, thin, cheap and does not require external energy input. The performance of the developed sensor was characterized by using malachite green, and the minimum 10-8 mol/L malachite green can be detected with 633 nm laser irradiation. Moreover, we optimized its dimensions, while retaining its excellent features such as easy fabrication, cost-effectiveness and thinness. The proposed sensor provides a new view for portable on-chip detection of liquid droplets."

In 2020, the concept of the fifth generation of fixed networks arose, aiming to define a clear evolution path toward 2025. Meanwhile, driven by the development of reusable rockets and laser communication technologies, satellite-based optical networks are emerging as a crucial component of the ICT infrastructure. They are expected to integrate with the ground optical networks, significantly transforming the architecture and capabilities of traditional optical networks. To include optical satellite networks within the scope of fixed networks, we propose five features for the next-generation fixed networks, with a focus on space-ground integration scenarios.

Edge-end collaborative rendering XR offers a promising direction but struggles with task decomposition, edge resource utilization, and practical infrastructure. This paper presents Crossport, a cloud-edge-end architecture that enables microservice-based collaborative rendering for metaverseser vices. Crossport introduces a scene-based microservice decomposition methodology, a composition toolchain supporting multiple consumers, and containerization middleware for integration with existing infrastructure. Experimental evaluation shows Crossport reduces edge resource consumption by up to 29.5% in single-user scenarios and 55.3% in multi-user contexts while maintaining high-quality immersive experiences."

    "abstract": "The utilization of Named Data Network (NDN) in Vehicle Autonomous Network (VANET) has emerged as a prominent research area, aiming to enhance data transmission and distribution. However, effectively addressing the mobility issues in NDN-based VANET poses significant challenges. Existing Q-learning-based geographic routing methods suffer from slow convergence and heavy reliance on dynamic Q-value tables. Moreover, local information-based next-hop selection does not always prioritize optimal global routing forwarding. To overcome these limitations, this study presents a novel routing strategy for in-vehicle named data networks, employing the Deep Prioritized Sarsa algorithm. The proposed approach incorporates fuzzy logic techniques and depth-first search algorithms to obtain and utilize comprehensive global road information. Additionally, it maintains an adaptive fixed-size Q-value table with a customized reward function for vehicle node selection. Simulation results showcase substantial improvements in terms of packet hit rate and end-to-end delay. This research contributes to the advancement of efficient and effective routing strategies for NDN-based VANET, addressing the challenges associated with mobility and data transmission in vehicular networks."

    "abstract": "Modern distributed computing systems face significant challenges in achieving optimal resource utilization and maintaining performance stability when operating in heterogeneous cluster environments with dynamic workloads. Existing task scheduling approaches often rely on heuristic rules or static policies that fail to adapt to runtime variations such as node failures, load fluctuations, and heterogeneous resource capacities. To address these limitations, we propose GART (Graph-based Adaptive Robust Task scheduling), a novel framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNN) and reinforcement learning for intelligent task scheduling in distributed systems. GART models distributed task workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and employs a specially designed GNN architecture to capture complex inter-task dependencies and resource requirements. The framework learns optimal scheduling policies through deep reinforcement learning, enabling adaptive decision-making that responds to dynamic system conditions. Our approach incorporates a robust scheduling mechanism that maintains high throughput and low latency even under adverse conditions including node failures and sudden load spikes. Extensive experiments on the Alibaba cluster trace dataset demonstrate that GART achieves 23.7% improvement in average job completion time, 31.4% reduction in resource imbalance, and 42.6% better resilience to node failures compared to state-of-the-art baseline schedulers including Shortest Job First, Tetrisched, and Decima. The results validate GART’s effectiveness in real-world heterogeneous distributed computing environments and its potential for deployment in production systems."

    "abstract": "A growing class of applications demands fair ordering of events, which ensures that events generated earlier are processed before later events. However, achieving such sequencing is challenging due to the inherent errors in clock synchronization: two events at two clients generated close together may have timestamps that cannot be compared confidently. We advocate for an approach that embraces, rather than eliminates, clock synchronization errors. Instead of attempting to remove the error from a timestamp, Tommy, our proposed system, leverages a statistical model to compare two noisy timestamps probabilistically by learning per-clock synchronization error distributions. Our preliminary statistical model computes the probability that one event precedes another by only relying on local clocks of clients. This serves as a foundation for a new relation: likely-happened-before denoted by →p where p represents the probability that an event happened before another. The →p relation provides a basis for ordering multiple events which are otherwise considered concurrent by Lamport's happened-before (→) relation. We highlight various related challenges including the intransitivity of the →p relation as opposed to the transitive → relation. We outline several research directions: online fair sequencing, stochastically fair total ordering, and handling byzantine clients."

This study explores how university students assign personality traits to QTrobot based on its design and behaviors in its role as a teaching assistant using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The study addresses three research questions: (1) What personality traits do the university students expect from the social robot as a teaching assistant? (2) What design elements affect the university students’ perceptions of the social robot's personality traits? and (3) What are the emotional reactions of the university students when interacting with the social robot as a teaching assistant? Utilizing a human-centered design (HCD) approach informed by participatory design (PD), two workshops with eight university students were conducted in the computing sciences department. Participants (N=8) interacted with QTrobot during a lesson on social media ethics, and data were collected through visual canvas tasks, questionnaires, and interviews, then primarily analyzed through thematic analysis and affinity diagramming. The findings indicate that students expect QTrobot to display social, supportive, and professional personality traits that align with the teaching assistant role. Students' perceptions of robot personality traits were strongly influenced by nonverbal cues, verbal communication style, and the robot's appearance. During the interaction, positive emotions of the participants emerged when QTrobot's behaviors aligned with expected traits, and mismatches in verbal and nonverbal communication led to negative emotions. The study offers a personality-driven design framework for designing social robots that improve UX by enhancing the perception of personality traits."

However, riskaverse investors will not invest in sufficient renewable electricity, back-up, electrolyzer and storage capacity if they are only remunerated for the hydrogen or electricity produced and markets for risk are missing. We develop a stochastic equilibrium model to study whether capacity markets can limit costs to consumers by restoring investments risk-neutral levels. Our results show that the efficacy of capacity markets depends on complementary instruments to ensure the availability of renewables. If riskaversion and missing markets for risk reduce renewable buildout, capacity markets in the electricity and hydrogen sectors are needed to restore the overall capacity mix and limit consumer costs. If complementary instruments lift investments in renewables, a capacity market in the electricity sector suffices. In this situation, an additional capacity market in the hydrogen sector triggers a bias toward hydrogen-fired backup capacity. This illustrates that an integrated systems perspective is required to design future energy markets."

    "abstract": "In the past few decades, the development of ICs has followed Moore’s law, and chip performance has been continuously improved based on device scaling and increased integration. However, as the device size approaches the physical limit, power tends to reach an unacceptable limit and becomes a bottleneck, limiting the clock speed of a single chip. Moreover, in recent years, with the booming development of artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) in this big data era, increasingly higher performance is required for chips. Advanced technologies, such as 3D stacking and chiplets, have been used to continuously improve chip performance, while simultaneously the power consumption of AI/HPC systems is continuously growing and has become a first-class design constraint. <p xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Various low-power techniques have been explored in the past 20 years. New energy-efficient architectures, such as near-memory computing, computing in memory, and neuromorphic computing, are being widely investigated. Power dissipation at the circuit level can be minimized by power management technologies, such as the use of multivoltage domains, multithreshold voltages, dynamic voltages, and frequency scaling. Beyond upper-level circuit and system strategies, transistor-level design serves as a foundational research method to address power consumption challenges, and reducing the supply voltage (<i>V</i><sub>DD</sub>) is one of the most effective and direct ways. From the transistor perspective, <i>V</i><sub>DD</sub> is essentially determined by the voltage needed for the transition from the off state to the on state with a satisfactory on/off current ratio. A steep subthreshold slope (SS) transistor is indispensable to make a sharper transition. This article focuses on emerging transistors with a steep SS of below 60 mV/dec at room temperature that can break the fundamental physical limitations of traditional MOSFETs. They include tunneling FETs (TFETs), negative-capacitance FETs (NCFETs), and cold-source FETs (CSFETs). Their theoretical mechanisms and electronic characteristics are reviewed as well as the state of the art and future development trends. These steep-slope transistors can be further integrated with circuit- and architecture-level low-power technologies, contributing to the green and sustainable development of chips.</p>"

This paper introduces a decentralized solar energy management framework that utilizes low-voltage DC micro-grids, Arduino-based smart metering, and peer-to-peer (P2P) energy sharing to fill this void. Each household is provided with an autonomous Solar Home System (SHS), linked through a local 24V DC network and monitored in real-time with custom-designed smart meters that incorporate LoRa communication modules. These meters enable ongoing monitoring of voltage, current, and SOC (State of Charge), as well as intelligent load management and dynamic energy redistribution among homes. A distributed energy exchange algorithm regulates the sharing process according to SOC thresholds, emphasizing system reliability and energy fairness. The proposed system is modeled and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink, utilizing location-specific solar irradiance data from Raipur, India. The simulation outcomes reveal enhanced energy utilization, improved battery longevity, and greater system resilience under fluctuating load and solar generation scenarios, confirming the efficacy of the decentralized P2P sharing model in rural electrification."

    "abstract": "Placing students into specialty pathways is an important decision that must consider the balance between student preferences, class quotas, and academic performance during study. This study proposes a framework that integrates the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method in weighting with a machine learning (ML) model for optimal specialty placement for students, so that it can become a decision support system (DSS). The data are obtained from the university environment, with the final score calculated based on a combination of test results (40 %), student preferences (60 % for the first choice and 30 % for the second choice), and competency scores weighted using AHP. Three classification models, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Network, are trained to predict the most suitable specialty pathway for students' conditions. Among the three models, the Neural Network model shows the highest performance with an accuracy of 97.78 %. The final allocation system considers a maximum quota of 150 students per pathway to ensure decision-making fairness. As a result, 382 students (82 %) were admitted according to their first choice, five students (1 %) were placed in their second choice, and 63 students (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 3} \\%$</tex>) were placed in a different track due to quota limitations. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating AHP and machine learning in supporting fair, transparent, and student-preference-oriented specialty placement decisions."

    "abstract": "The evolving nature of scientific ecosystems demands incentive systems that can fairly and adaptively accommodate diverse forms of research contributions. Traditional reward mechanisms, which are often static and centralised, tend to overlook non-publication activities such as peer review and data sharing. In response to this challenge, this study proposes a blockchain-based scientific incentive system using a Dynamic Smart Contract approach that enables administrators to update reward policies directly without requiring contract redeployment. The system is designed with a modular architecture and integrates a key-value store to support flexible and sustainable scientific reputation tokenisation. The model is implemented using a set of simulated Ethereum smart contracts, including a separate reward policy contract and keyvalue configuration logic, without actual on-chain deployment. The system is evaluated through a two-phase conceptual simulation involving changes in reward weightings while keeping the contribution data constant. The assessment focuses on three key aspects: adaptability, fairness, and stability. The results show that the system can adjust to policy changes in real time, shifting the dominant reward from publication (526.3 tokens) to peer review (580.6 tokens) after policy revision. It maintains fairness with a Gini Index of 0.156 and demonstrates structural consistency, with total token issuance increasing from 1000 to 1999.99 without duplication or inflation. These findings indicate that the proposed dynamic contract model offers a viable foundation for developing more inclusive, transparent, and context-responsive scientific reputation systems, particularly within the emerging framework of decentralised science."

In this study we explore the impact of different encoder backbones on U-Net architecture when applied to this task. We compared a basic U-Net with two enhanced versions of U-Net where Resnet34 and ResNet-50 were used as encoder part of U-Net. Key performance metrics like Mean Intersection over Union (IoU), F1 score, precision, and recall serve as the foundation for our result analysis. The results clearly show that the model performance improves as we use more advanced encoder backbone. The basic U-Net achieved a Mean IoU of 0.8266 and an F1 Score of 0.8225. When we use a ResNet-34 based encoder, the scores improved to a Mean IoU of 0.8562 and an F1 Score of 0.8409. The best results came from the U-Net with ResNet-50 as encoder backbone, which achieved a Mean IoU of 0.8606 and an F1 Score of 0.8468. These results show that using deeper pre-trained encoders can make a real difference in how accurately we can segment brain tumors. This leads to more reliable detection, which can help medical practitioners to improve diagnoses, make better decisions and ultimately improve patient care."

In this work, we present Simopt-power, a simulator-driven optimisation framework that leverages simulation analysis to identify and selectively reconfigure high-toggle paths. By feeding activity profiles back into a lightweight transformation pass, Simopt-power judiciously inserts duplicate truth table logic using Shannon Decomposition principle and relocates critical nets, thereby attenuating unnecessary transitions without perturbing functional behaviour. We evaluated this framework on open-source RTLLM benchmark, with Simopt-power achieves an average switching-induced power reduction of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\approx 9 \\%$</tex> while incurring only <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\approx 19 \\%$</tex> additional LUT-equivalent resources for arithmetic designs.

    "abstract": "The integration of battery energy storage systems (BESSs) into distribution systems to provide grid services represents a significant advancement of modern power system management. However, the ability of BESSs to provide grid services involving active power injection into the grid depends on their stored energy levels. In this paper, a rule-based state-ofcharge (SoC) management framework for a distributed energy resource management system (DERMS) is proposed to effectively manage the charging of utility-scale BESSs in a distribution system. The framework takes into account the amount of energy required for service provision and plans BESS charging accordingly, ensuring they are prepared for providing the grid services. It explores three charging options: using photovoltaic (PV) systems, combining PV systems with the grid, and solely using the grid. Depending on the grid service requirements, the framework employs one or multiple options, prioritizing PV power. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework, a distribution system with a large number of distributed energy resources is designed, and quasi-static time-series simulations are carried out. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework adeptly prepares the BESSs for a requested grid service that cannot be provided by PV systems."

    "abstract": "This paper surveys state-of-the-art applications of Machine Learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) based methods in crime prediction. The increasing criminal activities in urban cities require innovative solutions to enhance public safety. Crime prediction and detection systems, using ML and artificial intelligence, are one of the promising ways to alleviate this problem. Such systems are based on a vast amount of data, which might include historical crime information, social conditions, and environmental factors that can be used to predict potential criminal activities. The reviewed studies divide crime prediction technologies into two main groups: sophisticated deep learning techniques and conventional machine learning approaches. Traditional models such as decision trees, SVM, and k-nearest neighbors work well with structured and small-scale datasets. On the other hand, deep learning models, for instance, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and long short-term memory networks outperform in the sense of catching more complex patterns from a large number of unstructured datasets. The studies have concentrated on the integration of spatiotemporal analysis, feature extraction, and data preprocessing to enhance prediction accuracy. With significant progress achieved, several issues remain, including the scarcity of good-quality datasets that are accessible to the public and the inbuilt biases found in the latter. The combination of machine learning algorithms and communication networks improves the responsiveness and scalability of crime prediction models. Further research directions will be aimed at these limitations through the development of robust, scalable models and promoting interdisciplinary collaboration. Using comprehensive crime analysis frameworks, this has the potential not only to predict but also to proactively address criminal behavior, hence optimizing resource utilization for law enforcement agencies to better enhance community safety. This abstract aggregates results from various geographical contexts, hence proving the universal value of ML-based crime prediction systems in developing proactive crime management strategies."

While previous research has focused on software simulations or external coprocessors, our work details the full-stack integration into the CVA6 CPU core, implemented and validated entirely on an FPGA hardware prototype. The system is proven to be robust and compatible, successfully booting a standard Linux operating system and passing the complete suite of NIST SHA-3 cryptographic validation tests. Experimental results demonstrate that the shatr instruction provides an average performance gain of 155.21x for short inputs, 157.20x for long inputs over standard ISA execution of SHA-3 workloads. This acceleration is achieved with a minimal area overhead of 3.3% in LUTs and 1.5% in registers, with no degradation to the system’s maximum clock frequency and with no added critical path latency. This work provides a concrete, hardware-proven reference for SHA-3-based cryptographic extensions in open-source RISC-V platforms, bridging the gap between microarchitectural theory and practical, system-level deployment for SHA-3 acceleration."

    "abstract": "The Neuro-XAI proposed in this paper is an innovative solution to model brain tumor segmentation and classification based on MRI images to enhance the segmentation and classification accuracy as well as explainability. The architecture combines the semantic segmentation DeepLabV3+, hyperparameter tuning Bayesian Optimisation, and explainability via saliency maps. DeepLabV3+ model has a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.89 that outperforms baseline CNN models which have a DSC of 0.82 which can signal that the model has good segmentation capability. Further, the Intersection over Union (IoU) of tumor regions is 0.78, which has significantly improved the contouring of tumor boundary. In terms of classifications, the model shows an outstanding accuracy of 92 percent with the sensitivity and specificity reading of 0.90 and 0.94, respectively, with excellent discriminative ability between the benign and malign tumors. AUC of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve indicates superior quality of differentiating between tumor types and provides a value of 0.95. The framework also produces saliency maps, such that the areas in the MRI images that have maximum impact on the predictions of the model can also be visualized, to meet interpretability requirements of clinical applicability. The training and validation loss continue to decline with the training loss steadily improving as time passes through 10 epochs, and it is clear the model is converged and can generalize information. In general, the Neuro-XAI framework offers not only a high-accuracy methods of tumor detection but also their clarity which opens it to possibilities of real-world settings of clinical application in the diagnosis and treatment planning of brain tumor."

    "abstract": "Blockchain has the potential to be a game changer in the way health records are managed; it's secure, transparent and decentralized. Legacy EHR systems are plagued with data breaches, and interoperability challenges, as well as a central point of failure. Blockchain addresses these risks through its public ledger, cryptographic encoding, and consensus-driven verification, which all contribute to making health records tamper-resistant and auditable. Smart contracts automate access control so that you can share patient data with other authorized parties securely and in line with HIPAA or GDPR. The decentralized nature of blockchain also eliminates single points of failure, which mitigates the risk of hacking and unauthorized access. Further, blockchain promotes interoperation through normalization in data formats, such as Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), and facilitates the sharing of data between institutions while preserving privacy. Scalability solutions in the form of sharding and layer-2 protocols allow large-scale medical data to be processed in a decentralized manner while new consensus algorithms (e.g., Proof-of-Stake) keep energy consumption down. Much like transportation, there are some key challenges, such as regulatory adherence and compatibility with existing systems. Still, if used properly, blockchain could serve as a transparent, secure, and patient-centric model for health record management. New developments in post-quantum cryptography, AI-platform deeds and smart contracts will continue to reinforce blockchain's contribution to disrupting healthcare data management."

    "abstract": "Emotion classification is pivotal in numerous applications such as human-computer interaction, healthcare, marketing, and many more. Several methods exist in the literature for emotion classification. However, many of them are evaluated with high-definition images. Furthermore, some of them suffer from high computational costs due to the use of large-scale pre-trained models or attention models. Additionally, only a few of them are evaluated using watermarked facial images. Watermarked images can sometimes lead to inaccurate feature extraction. Thus, emotion classification becomes a challenging task, specifically for watermarked images. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an EmotionClassNet(ECN) method for emotion detection and classification from low-definition and watermarked images using DenseNet121. The proposed ECN method has been evaluated on two different datasets: FER2013 and CK+. The FER2013 dataset contains low-definition watermarked images, while the CK+ dataset contains low-definition images without a watermark. The proposed ECN method obtains 56% testing accuracy on the FER2013 dataset and 99% testing accuracy on the CK+ dataset. The proposed method demonstrates a significant advantage in handling challenging image conditions, such as low-definition images and the presence of watermarks. It outperforms other CNN architectures in terms of classification accuracy."

    "abstract": "Face recognition systems are increasingly vulnerable to presentation attacks, such as the use of high-quality silicone masks. These attacks can compromise the security of various applications, including access control, mobile payments, and law enforcement. To address this challenge, we conducted an empirical study to evaluate the susceptibility of commercial face recognition systems to silicone mask attacks and to develop effective presentation attack detection (PAD) techniques. We collected a new dataset consisting of 8 custom 3D silicone masks and bona fide presentations of the corresponding subjects using three different smartphones. We then assessed the vulnerability of two well-known commercial face recognition systems to these attacks and evaluated the performance of five state-of-the-art PAD techniques. Our findings demonstrate that silicone masks pose a significant threat to face recognition systems, even when using advanced commercial systems. However, we also propose effective PAD techniques that can significantly improve their security by leveraging features such as visual saliency and facial motion analysis. The results of this study have important implications for the development and deployment of robust face recognition systems in various applications."

In this paper, we introduce a new paradigm that classifies objects directly from streaming 3D point cloud data, which enhances real-time performance. With the exploitation of the continuous nature of the data, our method distributes computational workload across data acquisition time, avoiding peak load and enabling quicker and more efficient object classification. The primary aim of this project is to classify and visualize the 3D objects in 4D Point Cloud Data or streaming 3D point cloud data."

Replacing traditional payment methods with e-wallets has become an emerging trend among consumers. With this technology, individuals are no longer required to carry physical cash or credit cards, making purchasing activities more efficient and convenient. As global internet penetration continues to grow rapidly, there has been a significant shift in consumer expectations related to digital payment solutions. Ewallets have thus gained substantial traction, with increasing numbers of users preferring digital transactions over cash handling. Despite their popularity, concerns have emerged regarding the risks associated with e-wallet usage. This study explores both the benefits and potential drawbacks of e-wallet applications from the user's perspective. Findings suggest that enhancing user awareness is essential to mitigate negative outcomes. The research examines six key factors: perceived ease of use, trust, enjoyment, cyberattacks, security risks, and performance risks.

    "abstract": "Electrification is a common strategy for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but its efficacy depends on the proper implementation of policies and the metrics used to measure emissions. The study introduces a novel methodology using principal component analysis (PCA) to assess the evolution of electric grids and the penetration of renewable energy sources to inform electrification policies. The average emissions factor (AEF) is a commonly used metric to inform grid emissions, which has been improved substantially by the marginal emissions factor (MEF). Typically, MEF values are significantly higher than AEF, with most grids’ MEF reflecting the emission factor of their primary peaking thermal generators, which are coal or natural gas. The paper focuses on four major Independent Systems Operators in North America: IESO (Ontario), AESO (Alberta), CAISO (California), and ERCOT (Texas). The findings highlight the importance of considering both MEF and the variability ratio (VR) to understand how grids adapt to increasing demand and the integration of renewables."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, Heart and lung diseases are the most critical health concerns globally that cause significantly rising mortality rates. Heart Diseases (HDs) often present overlapping symptoms making early and accurate diagnosis a challenging task. Despite advancements in Machine Learning (ML), many existing traditional models struggle to maintain high accuracy and generalization across multi-disease classification tasks. This made it clear that there is a need for more adaptive and improved diagnostic frameworks. Therefore, a novel Deep Learning (DL)-based model named as Independent feature-based optimized Deep Neural Network (IFODNN), is presented in response to this challenge. The model utilizes integrated clinical datasets including the \"Heart Disease Dataset\" and the \"Lung Cancer Dataset\" to classify heart and lung-related conditions. To increase the classification performance in the form of accuracy while minimizing the error probability. This proposed IFODNN model is the combination of the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) used for feature extraction, Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) used for feature selection, and an improved DNN architecture for classification tasks. The comparative analysis between several DL models is performed by utilizing measures such as accuracy, SN, F1-score, etc. The proposed model achieved SN of 98.65%, SP of 99.16%, accuracy of 96.81%, RMSE of 0.102%, and F1-score of 93.0%. The model completed the classification task in just 2.44 seconds only and also achieved a training accuracy of 96.70%. When compared to existing traditional models, the proposed IFODNN model significantly outperformed them based on accuracy, SN, and F1-score. These findings reveal that the introduced IFODNN framework is not just capable of delivering accurate predictions but it can also be served as an effective tool for clinical support in multi-disease diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving (AD) are pushing game changing innovations in multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) radar system on chips (SoCs). Prioritizing safety to ensure drivers and pedestrians are protected is paramount in ADAS/AD systems. As the number of vehicles equipped with radar sensors increases so does the likelihood of mutual wireless interference among these radars leading to potential performance degradation which can compromise safety of these systems. Moreover, pedestrians unlike vehicles have low reflection intensity and there can be challenging scenarios where the pedestrians crossing roads cannot be detected due to interference from other radars. Interference mitigation in MIMO radar SoCs is needed to be done in real-time and the latency deadline for such processing is no more than a few microseconds. This paper proposes a latency/resource efficient accelerator design for interference mitigation in radar data processing SoCs. Our results show that the proposed accelerator can process radar data received from multiple antennas and mitigate interference within the required SoC processing deadline. The accelerator design is also optimized to reduce multiply and accumulate (MAC) operations which decreases hardware design complexity and enables resource efficiency."

    "abstract": "A Digital Noise Canceller (DNC) ADC is presented which is aimed at increasing the resolution of conventional high conversion rate ADCs. The DNC ADC architecture has a conventional first stage ADC, which is capable of operating at the desired conversion rate. To achieve the desired targeted resolution, a second stage Digital Noise Canceller (DNC) adaptive filter is implemented. The DNC adaptive filter functions to reduce the quantization noise and distortion introduced by the first stage ADC. A previous version used a Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) to convert the Most Significant Bits (MSBs) of the DNC adaptive filter output to analog for generation of the error signal by comparing to the analog input. The modified version presented here compares the digital output of the DNC adaptive filter to the digital output of the first stage ADC to generate the error signal. This eliminates the need for a DAC or analog comparator and results in an all-digital design excluding the mixed signal conventional first stage ADC. A MATLAB SIMULINK model of the DNC ADC is developed for performance assessment. Performance was evaluated with CW inputs across the NYQUIST bandwidth of the stage 1 ADC. The SIMULINK performance assessments demonstrate the addition of approximately 4 Effective Number of Bits (ENOB) to the output of an 8-bit Stage 1 ADC with a DNC adaptive filter length of 192 taps operating at 192MHz."

    "abstract": "Accurate and timely diagnosis of disease is a considerable challenge particularly in low-resource environments with limited computational resources. Existing image processing frameworks such as CPUs are too slow because they only allow limited levels of concurrency. Although GPUs provide faster performance they do so at the cost of energy efficiency. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are able to take advantage of both parallel execution and energy-efficient operation, making FPGAs a possible compromise between both extremes for the purposes of building efficient real-time diagnostic tools. This paper demonstrates a hardware-accelerated system to perform binary image classification for the purpose of confirming malaria detection using lightweight machine learning classification models—k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Decision Trees. The image classification pipeline is composed of conversion to grayscale followed by image binarization and finally resizing images to the hardware-optimized size for processing, providing prompt processing speeds without substantial degradation in accuracy. All learning models have been developed with Verilog HDL and deployed to ZYNQ-7 ZC702 FPGA development board using concurrent processing capabilities of the board efficiently. The final system was successfully able to classify in real-time with classification accuracy reaching 80% while remaining energy efficient. The findings in this paper demonstrate the practicality of an FPGA-based learning system as portable, low-power, real-time medical diagnostic systems for malaria detection."

Assessing the gap-sunlight-intrusion risk is a crucial step in the MERO protection unit design and operation planning. In this study, we proposed a new method to estimate such a risk taking into account the Earth atmosphere radiative refraction and attenuation as well as the entrance pupil irradiance of the MERO, which could find the new refracted-type risky events and eliminated the included “fake” risky incidents compared to current method solely based on Sun-Earth-Moon geometric analysis. 18.6-years evaluation from Jan 2021 to Sep 2039 shows that gap-sunlight-intrusion risk annual duration ranges from 10 to 29 hours. MERO-location-effect assessment exhibits that MERO location latitudinal change (from (0°E, 81°N) to (0°E, 81°S)) would result in an annual risky duration difference ranging from 0 to 5 hours, and that induced by longitudinal MERO location change (from (80°E, 0°N) to (80°W, 0°S)) varied between 0 and 3 hours. Total risky time occupies 0.23% in the 18.6-years evaluation period (Jan 2021 to Sep 2039), which is about 2.56 times larger than that of the study only with consideration of the Sun-Earth-Moon geometry."

Experimental results demonstrate that ProcessTransformer achieves an average F1-score of 0.923, outperforming baseline methods by 12.7% on next-activity prediction tasks and reducing prediction time by 34%.

Namely, for small cells, their shapes maintain single-row-height while for large cells, they adopt double-row-height to balance the horizontal and vertical I/O pin accessibility. However, this unique shape restriction of each cell type in the mixed-row-height cell libraries makes the placement legalization problem severely ineffective, creating lots of inflexibility in moving cells and resulting in considerable quality degradation. This work overcomes this legalization problem. To this ends, (1) for intensively used moderate size cells, we prepare, for each cell type, multiple cell shapes of comparable PPA (power, performance, area), precisely, one shape of single-row-height and two shapes of double-row-height where one is VDD-abut and the other VSS-abut on the top and bottom of cell boundary. Then, (2) we propose a new iterative refinement algorithm of placement legalization, which is able to dynamically select, at each iteration of cell swapping, the cell shape that is best suitable for achieving the least displacement cost, which otherwise would be unattainable, while meeting the cell non-overlapping constraint. In the meantime, through experiments with OpenCores benchmark circuits, it is shown that our method is able to simultaneously reduce the total cell displacement and HPWL by 17.1% and 10.5%, and 11.2% and 7.8% over the legalization results produced by a commercial tool and an existing state-of-the-art legalization refiner, respectively."

    "abstract": "Training neural networks directly on embedded system-on-chip (SoC) platforms presents considerable challenges, primarily due to the limited computational capacity and memory resources of low-power hardware. Batch normalisation (BN), a fundamental technique for enhancing the convergence and stability of neural network training, introduces additional computational complexity through the calculation of mini-batch statistics and affine transformations. To address these constraints, we propose a hardware-efficient BN engine tailored for the AMD Versal AI Core VCK190 platform. The architecture employs a memory-mapped design that incorporates a Direct Memory Access (DMA) module, an AXI4-Lite control interface, and a tiled fixed-point compute core to ensure both performance and scalability. This implementation enables efficient execution of BN operations within embedded environments, thereby facilitating complete on-device training pipelines. Furthermore, such advancements are critical to supporting the emerging demands of on-chip training in neuroimaging applications—particularly those employing functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) sensors—where real-time, low-power computation is essential for robust and autonomous cognitive state analysis at the edge."

Deep learning (DL) has improved medical image analysis accuracy and efficiency, speeding diagnosis and improving patient outcomes. Many deep learning models are \"black-box\" with little transparency and interpretability, especially in essential medical applications. This research combines explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) with deep learning models in medical imaging to increase diagnostic reliability and interpretability. We discuss explainable deep learning frameworks like saliency maps, Class Activation Mapping (CAM), and attention mechanisms to understand how models make decisions by visualising which image portions contribute most to model predictions. Explainable deep learning models can close the transparency gap in medical image analysis, allowing healthcare providers to trust and comprehend the model's findings. Grad-CAM, LRP, and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) help improve the interpretability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other deep learning models. We also examine the practical consequences of these models in clinical domains including radiology, pathology, and dermatology, where proper interpretation and explanation of data are essential for informed treatment decisions. The study also addresses current issues like the model accuracy-interpretability trade-off, the requirement for large annotated datasets for explainable model training, and the integration of explainable deep learning into clinical processes. We conclude with recommendations for future study, including hybrid models that balance performance and explainability and standardised medical imaging explainability measures. This study emphasises the significance of making deep learning models for medical imaging accurate, clear, and interpretable to build trust and improve clinical diagnosis."

Traditional methods, including analytical and numerical approaches, often struggle with precision and computational efficiency, while machine learning models offer potential advantages in adaptability and generalization. This paper aims to compare and evaluate different approaches for solving the inverse kinematics problem in a biped robot, specifically focusing on numerical, analytical, and neural network-based methods. The methodology involves the development of an analytical model using Denavit-Hartenberg parameters, a numerical model based on the Conjugate Gradient Method, and a neural network approach trained on a dataset of robot configurations. The evaluation includes a comparison of the error and computational time for each method, as well as an assessment of their performance in different scenarios. The results show that while the numerical method is faster and more stable, the neural network model offers higher precision, particularly in more complex configurations like the legs, with a trade-off in inference time. The findings contribute valuable insights into the trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating that both approaches have their place in real-time applications for biped robots, especially in dynamic and reconfigurable environments."

Assuming annual single-site photovoltaic generation matches annual household demand, required storage proves prohibitively high. This paper examines the impact of geographic location and load shaping on reducing household-level storage needs. Results show that the feasibility of $\\mathbf{1 0 0 \\%}$ renewable firm power for residential consumers is highly dependent on the timing and consistency of renewable energy generation.

Conventional centralized control strategies often face limitations such as communication delays, scalability concerns, and vulnerability to system-wide failures. This paper proposes a fully decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to enhance distribution system resilience. The proposed framework develops autonomous MARL agents that independently learn localized control policies for real-time fault detection, isolation, and voltage stabilization. To improve performance, adaptive reward shaping is employed to enhance fault detection accuracy, reduce false positives, and accelerate system recovery. Each PPO agent is trained with customized observation spaces, action strategies, and power flow constraints to ensure robust decision-making under dynamic grid conditions. Simulations on the IEEE 33-bus system demonstrate the proposed framework’s superior fault detection accuracy, faster isolation response, and improved voltage stability compared to conventional reinforcement learning and deep learning models, effectively enhancing grid resilience."

Automotive radars have grown substantially in use among modern cars for collision warning and avoidance systems. While the radar return from other vehicles can be large, other road users such as bicyclists can be less detectable. Just as bicycles often employ optical reflectors to stand out when illuminated with car headlights, the detectability of bicycles can be enhanced for automotive radars by using radar reflectors. We have designed and built 3D printed corner reflector for mounting on bicycles in order to enhance their radar reflectivity. Theoretical calculations and simulations show that the detection range of a bicycle may be increased up to 75 meters based on the expected radar cross section (RCS) of a standard bicyclist for a 77 GHz radar."

    "abstract": "Driven by the advent of powerful AI-based computer vision models founded on Deep Neural Networks, integrating these models into safety-critical systems is increasingly appealing. However, unlike traditional systems, AI-based models face novel challenges in achieving the required level of dependability. This includes that AI-models tend to be overconfident in their predictions and do not inherently provide a measure of failure when confronted with out-of distribution cases, incapabilities of the model, or hardware errors.To tackle these challenges, new safety standards recommend a redundancy and diversity approach, e.g., approximations of Bayesian Neural Networks, which significantly increases compute demand. To mitigate this burden, we present architectural extensions that can be integrated in modern neural processing units. By incorporating flexible stochastic modules in the data paths of the compute array and thereby keeping the data local, the need for costly off-chip memory accesses is drastically reduced. We demonstrate our approach using an open-source accelerator architecture and make our contributions openly available as well <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>.

To do so, we discuss three well-known qualitative methods and approaches: participatory action research, ethnographic methods, and positionality as concrete ways of engaging with the social and operational realities that underlie technical systems. These approaches formalize processes that are commonly implicit in networking research, help surface questions that cannot be answered with traces alone, and make space for voices often left out of the research pipeline or are inadvertently concealed due to the lack of formal procedures to include them in our research methods. Ultimately, we argue for a broader understanding of legitimate, and sometimes informal, contributions to networking research—one that better reflects the human element of how the Internet is structured and is experienced."

PDO-AODV (Power and Delay Optimised AODV) uses a cross-layer design to optimise routing efficiency and minimise latency. The Secure Routing Protocol for Military MANETs (SRPMM) prioritises communications between strategic nodes by providing an optimised service layer with guaranteed data delivery and bounded delay. In simulation results, the model delivers significantly better packet delivery ratios, throughputs, and end-to-end delays than traditional protocols, demonstrating its potential for real-time, resilient, and secure military communication."

For training purposes, we generate synthetic datasets using the ray-tracing simulation technique. The feasibility and accuracy of the ML-based PL models are verified and validated using both synthetic and measurement datasets. The random forest regression (RFR) and the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithms provide the best PL prediction accuracy compared to other ML models. In addition, we compare the performance of the developed ML-based PL models with the traditional propagation models including COST-231 Hata, Longley-Rice, and Close-in models. The results show the superiority of the ML-based PL models compared to conventional models. Therefore, the ML approach using the ray-tracing technique can provide a promising and cost-effective solution for predicting and modeling radio wave propagation in various scenarios in a flexible manner."

    "abstract": "State of charge (SOC) estimation plays a crucial role in battery management, and filtering methods based on equivalent circuit models (ECM) are popular. In ECM, the measured variable is typically the terminal voltage, which has a nonlinear relationship with SOC but linear relationships with other state variables. Therefore, the measurement model has highly nonlinear and linear terms simultaneously. To address the system’s nonlinearity, many classical nonlinear filtering methods which estimate the state of nonlinear dynamic systems from noisy measurement have been applied. However, most of these methods are linear-structured filters based on the linear minimum mean square error criterion, which does not match well with nonlinear problems. Recently proposed uncorrelated conversion (UC) filtering is a nonlinear-structured filter that breaks through the limitations of the linear framework, making better use of measurement information and improving estimation performance for highly nonlinear systems. However, the presence of linear terms in the measurement model causes that directly applying UC does not significantly enhance performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a variational Bayesian filtering method for battery systems, which iteratively processes linear and nonlinear terms. For the linear term, the optimal posterior estimate is obtained, while for the nonlinear terms, UC is applied to further improve information utilization efficiency. Evaluations based on public datasets and experiments conducted in this paper show that the proposed method reduces SOC absolute estimation error from 1.2% with existing methods to 0.09%, representing a significant performance improvement."

To address these challenges, we propose a novel implicit neural representation (INR)-based framework for automated medical image compression, leveraging the powerful continuous signal modeling capabilities of INRs to achieve high fidelity on high-dimensional medical images while maintaining compactness and adaptability. Our framework integrates an evolutionary architecture search strategy with privacy-constrained optimization and parameter quantization, enabling the architectures that balance reconstruction quality, latency, communication cost, and privacy. To validate the effectiveness of the framework, we design and conduct comprehensive simulation experiments in realistic multi-hospital IBN environments. The results demonstrate that our INR-based designs outperform traditional and data-driven baselines in both objective metrics and deployment feasibility under constrained resources."

Despite its clinical importance, a reliable, non-invasive, and continuous method for ICP monitoring is still lacking. This study presents a practical microwave-based technique for fully non-invasive and continuous assessment of ICP. The designed microwave sensors are thin, small, planar, and lightweight, optimized for both sensitivity and anatomical compatibility. The sensors are tested on a realistic human head phantom model specifically developed for this study. A quantitative method based on advanced signal attributes: minima of antenna response, Area Under the Curve (AUC), Differential Multi-Static-Data Matrix (DMDM), Root Mean Square Multi-Static-Data Matrix (RMSMDM), and Group Delay Distortion (GDD) is devised to capture variations in the measured signal corresponding to changes in ICP. Multiple measurement trials demonstrate that the system can detect small changes in ICP with high accuracy. The estimated ICP values correlate strongly with ground-truth measurements obtained via invasive pressure sensors."

Unlike traditional IDS, which relies on centralized data processing and raises privacy concerns, Federated Learning (FL)-based IDSs enable collaborative model training among multiple clients while keeping user data private. However, explaining model behavior in FL using Explainable AI (XAI) is challenging due to its distributed nature and lack of access to client data. Traditional XAI methods like LIME and SHAP require input data, which conflicts with FL’s privacy constraints. In this work, we develop a deep neural network (DNN)-based IDS in FL setup in Non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) settings. Our FL-DNN model achieves high performance in binary classification for detecting malicious network traffic. In this work, we propose a novel privacy-preserving, explainable federated learning framework that uses high-quality synthetic data to enable explainability of the Global DNN model without exposing client data to the server. To generate synthetic data, we train multiple federated generative models in Non-IID settings. Among them, the Federated Wasserstein Conditional GAN with Gradient Penalty (FL-WCGAN-GP) produces synthetic samples with high data quality at the server. These synthetic samples on the server side are then used as reference inputs for post-hoc XAI methods for explaining the global DNN model. We assess the sufficiency of synthetic data-based explanations for the Global DNN model using SHAP, showing that Synthetic data-based explanations closely approximate the explanations derived from real client data. Further, we quantitatively evaluate post-local explanations of LIME and SHAP based on faithfulness and robustness. Results show that SHAP provides more faithful and robust explanations than LIME for client-side models using real data and server-side models using synthetic data, supporting privacy-preserving explainability in trustworthy FL-based IDS."

The SoF-based adaptive approach dynamically tunes the inertial parameters of the grid-forming converter according to grid events, thereby enhancing system resilience during disturbances. Interoperability is further supported by a Legacy Protocol Converter (LPC), enabling seamless integration of different devices. The effectiveness of the proposed framework, covering seamless islanding, smooth resynchronization, and reinforcement of weak grids, has been demonstrated in a pilot project in Spain, combining PSCAD simulations with megawatt-scale laboratory testing. The results confirm the practical viability of the approach and highlight the importance of hybridization with adaptive interoperable operation of HESS in low-inertia systems."

    "abstract": "This paper presents operation and control of a grid-interactive wind microgrid (MG) designed for remote areas. MG comprises a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) and a battery energy storage (BES), operating in both grid-tied and standalone modes. DFIG tied wind turbine functions in maximum power point tracking (MPPT) zone for maximum energy utilization. Based on synchronization/disconnection of DFIG stator to point of common interconnection (PCI) and PCI to the grid, four operating states are identified, managed through solid-state power electronic switches. To address power quality issues under weak distorted grid conditions, this study proposes a weight-optimized variable step size adaptive (WOVSSA) filter-based control for battery-based grid following or grid forming converter (GFC). Main novelty of proposed control is its ability to provide enhanced estimation dynamics and stabilize inverter control loops, ensuring superior power quality even during voltage disturbances. Control ensures smooth synchronization and rapid mode transitions using an adaptive enhanced complex coefficient filter-phase locked loop (AECCF-PLL), enabling fast and reliable phase and frequency tracking. MG ensures uninterrupted power supply across all operating states while providing ancillary services such as harmonic suppression, reactive power injection, and voltage regulation. MATLAB simulations and laboratory validation using a dSPACE DS1202 controller demonstrate that proposed control delivers better dynamic performance and improved power quality compared to conventional approaches."

    "abstract": "The entropy coefficient is one of the important factors for battery temperature prediction, and its measuring error directly affects the calculation accuracy of temperature. The traditional potentiometric method obtains the entropy coefficient from the open circuit voltage (OCV) change and battery temperature. However, this paper points out that the error of OCV change can reach 833%, and such a large error makes the predicted battery temperature far from the true value. The entropy coefficients obtained by the traditional potential method are applied to the battery thermal model, and the mean absolute error (MAE) and mean relative error (MRE) of temperature can reach 16.76 °C and 74.94%. To reduce the error and improve the test accuracy of entropy coefficient, this paper identifies the entropy coefficient through the test temperature and battery thermal model. The identified entropy coefficient can greatly reduce the prediction error in the temperature. With its application, the MAE falls from 16.76 °C to 0.35 °C and MRE decreases from 74.94% to 1.56%. Under conditions of different states of health (SOHs), the entropy coefficient identified by the proposed method can also help the thermal model accurately predict the temperature, and the maximum MAE in this study is below 1 °C."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an autonomous robot packing system named RoboPacker designed to tightly store cluttered general objects into shipping boxes with high space utilization, which is a fundamental process in numerous industrial applications. However, achieving tight packaging for general objects often demands significant labor from human packers, particularly in high-throughput scenes. Compared to existing robot packing approaches, RoboPacker effectively overcomes challenges such as diverse object appearances, severe occlusion, and crowded packing spaces. Specifically, we propose an open-vocabulary shape estimation method to reconstruct complete point clouds for cluttered objects. We also design effective interactions with object clutter to gather informative visual clues for shape estimation under high uncertainty. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework to optimize packing order, location, and orientation for maximum space utilization. The robotic packing system integrates these techniques with feasible manipulation methods for real-world implementation. In this way, RoboPacker achieves efficient packing of novel and irregular objects, which is more suitable for real deployment environments. The Real-world experiments demonstrate RoboPacker can tightly pack 20 densely cluttered everyday objects from 8 seen and 4 novel classes into the 40×40×20 cm shipping box with a 73.3% success rate. The demonstration video can be found at https://gary3410.github.io/RoboPacker/."

The proposed approach leverages the combined power of existing software generators to generate firmware, ensuring interoperability with existing C-based systems while allowing for a gradual migration towards modern Rust-based systems. This enables an improved support of the safety features available in Rust, compared to an interfaced C-code called from Rust, which cannot provide these guarantees. The paper provides an overview of the fundamental building blocks of the approach and discusses the challenges and advantages of chaining both generators. Our Halstead measurments highlight the advantages of utilizing this Model-Driven approach in reduction of manual effort and the risk. This reduction is comparable to the results found in state-of-the-art literature, as highlighted by the comparison presented in this paper, but provides dual-language embedded code.

    "abstract": "Renewable energy systems, especially those in aerospace, automotive, industrial, and medical fields, require high reliability and performance to ensure continuous and reliable operation. However, photovoltaic (PV) boost converters are vulnerable to power switch faults, such as open and short circuits (OCF and SCF), which can significantly affect system reliability and lead to false alarms. This study introduces a fault detection, identification, and reconfiguration method (FDIRM) that utilises artificial neural networks (ANN) for detecting, identifying, and compensating the switches faults. The MPPT method used incorporates an ANN-driven sliding-mode maximum power point tracking strategy (ANN-SM MPPT) for enhanced PV performance. The investigated FDIRM method uses real-time data on power, voltage, current, and duty cycle of the PV module, allowing the ANN to rapidly detect and compensate for faults using only current and voltage sensors, simplifying system complexity and reducing costs. A redundant leg is also combined into the boost converter topology to maintain PV module functionality following fault reconfiguration. In this study, the diagnostic and reconfiguration approaches of the PV boost converter are designed and implemented using hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) control managed by the dSPACE 1104 board programmed in MATLAB/SIMULINK. The simulation results confirm the high performance of FDIRM, demonstrating effective fault detection, isolation, and compensation to support autonomous and robust operation."

The framework is trained and validated on the Kronodroid dataset, a hybrid corpus encompassing over 140,000 samples sourced from both physical devices and emulator environments. Static and dynamic features are systematically extracted and fused into a unified representation. A CNN-LSTM architecture enhanced with attention mechanisms is employed to learn spatial and temporal behavior patterns, while an Extra Trees ensemble model offers complementary insights with low inference latency. The final classification leverages a confidence-based fusion strategy that combines the strengths of both models. The proposed system demonstrates an accuracy of 99.23%, alongside significantly reduced false positive and false negative rates, highlighting its potential for real-world deployment. By balancing predictive performance with architectural efficiency, the framework provides a scalable foundation for future mobile malware defense systems."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a safe deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for the management of low-carbon energy in microgrids (MGs) that integrate renewable energy sources (RESs) and electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS). The inherent variability of RESs, combined with the high power demands of EVCS, poses significant challenges to the real-time operation of MGs, thereby necessitating advanced optimization techniques. Although DRL methodologies offer data-driven approaches to facilitate adaptive decision-making, current penaltybased strategies frequently fall short in effectively enforcing operational constraints under complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a primal-dual DRL methodology utilizing the proximal policy optimization (PD-PPO) algorithm, which incorporates operational constraints directly into the policy learning framework. The MG energy management problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), which encompasses distributed generators, RESs, and the demands of EVCS. The PD-PPO algorithm guarantees stable policy updates and ensures robust constraint satisfaction without the need for penalty coefficient adjustments. Comprehensive numerical experiments based on real-world datasets for renewable energy generation and electricity demand demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in achieving low-carbon objectives while optimizing MG operations."

    "abstract": "One of the emerging problems associated with neural networks is their resilience to adversarial input data.This paper focuses on recurrent neural networks (RNN), like Long Short-Time Memory networks (LSTM) or Nonlinear AutoRegressive networks with eXogenous inputs (NARX). It shows how one might prepare some malicious input data to make the trained neural network produce wrong answers. This paper aims to analyze such manipulations’ impact on RNN-based networks. The article will include a comprehensive study of which gradient-based and non-gradient-based data manipulation techniques are possible.An LSTM network will be used for a classification task of a text sequence, but a similar approach might be applied to electrical signals or network traffic data. Due to the discrete nature of the sequence tokens, it covers techniques based on synonymization, token removal, or random token insertion. A technique leveraging the BERT model to search for more context-aware synonyms is presented.This paper adapts methods like Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to generate adversarial sequences of tokens. The mentioned method allows using a gradient of the model’s loss function to discover optimal token perturbations. This article shows the results of experiments on how different word embeddings (like GloVe or Word2Vec) affect the model’s performance and accuracy.Final findings suggest that LSTM models exhibit greater resistance to subtle input changes (using synonyms) than standard RNNs but remain susceptible to more advanced attacks. The research shows that crafting an adversarial sequence of tokens is inherently more complex than crafting a malicious image data or a time series. However, it is still feasible and can result in successful model misclassification.The second part of the paper focuses on recurrent neural networks for a forecasting task. A NARX model is trained to predict the sensor readings of a simple ventilation system. The input to the model is a control signal with an electric valve states. This model is a troublesome due to its recurrent connections. An Automatic Differentiation is used for efficient calculation of the gradient with respect to the input control signal. The Forward Accumulation Automatic Differentiation presents itself as a viable option for a fast calculation of such a gradient. This derivatives might be useful at determining how the input signal have to be modified in order to change the predicted values significantly."

Cloud infrastructure is relieved of this burden by fog computing, which processes data at the network edge, thereby reducing the load on the cloud. Fog environments, however, are often plagued by issues such as inefficient load balancing, high energy consumption, and security vulnerabilities. SDN-enabled fog computing infrastructures can benefit from a load-balancing framework that is both energy-efficient and secure. Tasks are intelligently distributed across fog nodes using energy-aware task scheduling, lightweight security mechanisms, and centralised intelligence from SDN controllers. Simulated experiments demonstrate that the proposed model reduces energy consumption, task execution time, and response latency while maintaining system security and load distribution. Based on these results, we can conclude that the model enhances resource utilization, sustainability, and performance in dynamic fog computing environments."

Traditional machine learning approaches treat customers as independent entities, ignoring the rich relational information inherent in customer networks. This paper proposes a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that captures complex customer interactions and social influences to predict churn probability. We model customers as nodes in a graph, with edges representing various relationships including referrals, shared services, and social connections.

Experiments on three real-world datasets—Telco Customer Churn, IBM Watson Churn, and Kaggle Subscription Service—demonstrate that our GNN-based model achieves superior performance with accuracy improvements of 7.3%, 8.1%, and 6.8% over traditional methods including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Multi-Layer Perceptron. The model achieves F1-scores of 0.847, 0.862, and 0.835 on respective datasets, with AUC-ROC scores exceeding 0.91 across all benchmarks. Our findings suggest that incorporating network topology significantly enhances churn prediction capabilities, enabling more effective customer retention strategies."

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a most common neurological condition marked by recurrent seizures, which can greatly affect both the lives of individuals and their interactions within society. The sudden and unpredictable occurrence of epilepsy seizures, hence there is a growing need for automated systems to aid in epilepsy diagnosis. Historically diagnosis involves analysing EEG signals, but recent advancements in deep learning have gained traction for their ability to automate this process without relying on manual feature extraction. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), while effective at capturing local temporal features, often struggle with modeling long-range dependencies due to their limited receptive fields, which can hinder performance in EEG signal decoding. To address this, we introduce a lightweight Convolutional Transformer architecture, termed EEG Conformer, which integrates local as well as global feature extraction into a cohesive EEG classification framework. The convolutional module is designed to extract low-level temporal and spatial features using one-dimensional convolutional layers. In parallel, a self-attention mechanism is employed to model long-range temporal dependencies by identifying global patterns within the local features. Following this, a simple fully connected classifier predicts the EEG signal categories. To improve interpretability, we implement a visualization approach that maps class activation outputs onto the brain’s topography. We validate our model on three publicly available datasets related to EEG-based motor imagery and emotion recognition tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches and shows strong potential as a robust baseline for general EEG decoding tasks."

    "abstract": "In today’s highly competitive marketplace, dynamic pricing strategies have become essential tools for maximizing revenue across various industries. Traditional static pricing models fail to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions, customer preferences, and competitive pressures. This research introduces an innovative framework leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to enable automated, intelligent pricing decisions in revenue management applications. Our approach builds upon the Deep Q-Network (DQN) architecture, incorporating two significant enhancements: prioritized experience replay mechanisms that accelerate learning from critical pricing scenarios, and dueling network structures that separately evaluate state values and action advantages. These architectural improvements enable the system to effectively learn near-optimal pricing policies even in environments characterized by substantial demand uncertainty and volatility. We conduct extensive empirical validation using authentic transaction data from two major sectors: hotel reservations and commercial aviation. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that our DRL-based pricing system achieves substantial revenue gains, specifically a 12.3% improvement over conventional rule-based pricing methods that rely on fixed thresholds and heuristics, and a 7.8% enhancement compared to classical Q-learning algorithms. These results provide compelling evidence that deep learning architectures possess the capacity to extract and leverage intricate patterns in market dynamics, competitive behaviors, and customer purchasing decisions, ultimately enabling more sophisticated and profitable pricing strategies in complex, real-world revenue management scenarios."

The paper explores a thematic review of social sustainability management theories in developing a socially conscious adaptive theoretical framework towards flexibility and resilience of Distribution System Operators (DSO)-level power systems. The adaptive theoretical framework potentially helps create a research field where social actors and systems are not decoupled from decision-making across multiple scales, where the embeddedness of the system is not taken for granted and fully captures the nuances at the nexus of systems, agents, and transition. The result highlights systems theory, agency theory and transition management theory as the core of a socially sustainable active distribution network."

Unlike conventional 1T-1C dynamic RAM (DRAM), which incurs refresh overhead, 2T-nC FeRAM offers a promising alternative as a non-volatile memory solution with low energy consumption. Our key findings include the potential of quasi-nondestructive readout (QNRO) sensing in 2T-nC FeRAM for logic-in-memory (LiM) applications, demonstrating its inherent capability to perform inverting logic without requiring external modifications, a feature absent in traditional 1T-1C DRAM. We successfully implement the MINORITY function within a single cell of 2T-nC FeRAM, enabling universal NAND and NOR logic, validated through SPICE simulations and experimental data. Additionally, the research investigates the feasibility of 3D integration with 2T-nC FeRAM, showing substantial improvements in storage and computational density, facilitating bulk-bitwise computation. Our evaluation of eight real-world, data-intensive applications reveals that 2T-nC FeRAM achieves 2× higher performance and 2.5× lower energy consumption compared to DRAM. Furthermore, the thermal stability of stacked 2T-nC FeRAM is validated, confirming its reliable operation when integrated on a compute die. These findings emphasize the advantages of 2T-nC FeRAM for LiM, offering superior performance and energy efficiency over conventional DRAM."

    "abstract": "Telecom Network planning and construction that comes under the purview of Outside Plant Engineering is one of the most critical functions of a Telecom service provider. Accurate estimation of fiber cable length and cost management during Network planning is critical for the successful deployment of fiber networks. However, issues arise in costs and scheduled deployments due to discrepancies between planned and actual lengths leading to delays in network deployment and reduced customer satisfaction. One of the key reasons for this is the differences in topography and non-planar terrain that would result in changes in fiber estimations, splitters and the planned network topology. This can lead to significant cost overruns and project delays. This paper explores the challenges associated with these discrepancies, the importance of path creation, and proposes methods to improve estimation accuracy using the Geodesic DEM dataset. The paper proposes ways in which a 2D plan can be transformed into a 3D plan (a non-planar terrain), thereby giving a better length estimation. The authors also explore other alternative methods and the future extensions to the proposed methodology."

The main goal of this research is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the best fish species to raise in an aquatic environment and suggest many fish species with anticipated ones. In this research, we have employed a number of supervised and unsupervised machine learning models. To evaluate the model, we used a dataset of aquatic habitats for eleven different fish species. We predicted the fish species using a variety of aquatic environmental factors, including temperature, turbidity, and pH. As performance measurements, we employed accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall. According to experimental findings, it is suggested that the Random Forest (RF) model’s prediction result exhibits an accuracy of 97.64% with good precision, recall, and F1 score for the dataset under test. Furthermore, we compare the results of the suggested model with the most advanced models, including SVC, random forest, gradient boosting, MLP, KNN, and others. The proposed model performs better than other applied models, as evidenced by its accuracy score and statistics. Finally, we applied an unsupervised ML model, K-means clustering to make recommendations of multiple species with the predicted fish species.

Further, current research highlights issues such as variability in size, shape, color, and texture across date varieties. These limitations drive the need for advanced machine learning techniques, especially neural networks, to enhance accuracy and optimize decision-making processes. This research presents an optimized neural network-driven intelligent system, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to enhance decision-making in agriculture. It develops and evaluates various neural network architectures, including bilayer, wide, tri-layer, and a proposed optimizable neural network. Among these, the optimizable neural network achieved the highest classification accuracy. To further improve performance, feature engineering techniques such as MRMR, Chi-square, ANOVA, and Kruskal were applied, with MRMR proving most effective. Moreover, backward sequential feature selection identified an optimal set of top 18 ranked features, significantly enhancing the model's predictive accuracy and efficiency.

These methods rely on real feedback from the target hardware to tailor DNN architectures for efficient deployment. While the search can be parallelized, latency measurements via hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) remain a bottleneck due to their sequential nature. Recent approaches use latency predictors to replace costly HIL feedback, but challenges persist: (1) platform-specific predictors often require tens of thousands of samples, and (2) inaccurate predictions can mislead the NAS process. To address this, we introduce HiFi-LLP, a high-fidelity, low-cost latency predictor based on graph attention networks, augmented with a confidence metric. HiFi-LLP outperforms prior platform-specific predictors by up to 9 percentage points (p.p.) in the 10% accuracy bound and achieves a Spearman’s rank correlation of up to 0.996 across six devices in the LatBench dataset. We further propose a hybrid NAS framework that routes low-confidence predictions to HIL, achieving up to 8.6× speedup compared to typical NAS while maintaining a competitive Pareto front.

    "abstract": "The swiftly changing trends in wearable and flexible electronics call for next-generation materials to be light, energy-effective, and even environmentally friendly. Silicon-based devices, the conventional semiconductors for electronics, have now reached a limitation in flexibility and high processing costs and so-called green impacts. At that point, their attention has shifted to organic semiconductors and two-dimensional (2D) materials. Thus, the research intends to develop high-performance hybrid electronic devices based, by the synergy of organic semiconductors with 2D materials (graphene, MoS₂, and MXenes), on flexibility, scalability, and sustainability. In contrast with traditional approaches that either consider organic-focusing or 2D-materials-focusing, the present work proposes a hybrid framework integrating organic semiconductors for mechanical flexibility with high electrical conductivity present in 2D materials. The main new point is the incorporation of solution-processable organic layers with CVD-grown 2D layers for optimization of the charge transport, mechanical stability, and durability of devices. The framework would involve (i) material selection and hybridization, (ii) scalable fabrication using inkjet printing and CVD, and (iii) performance analysis across transistor, sensor, and energy storage applications. The experimental evaluations provided better than a 40% increase in charge mobility, more than over 10⁶ bending cycles of durability, and measurement accuracy always above 95% compared with theoretical benchmarks. The hybrid devices showed superior electrical and mechanical performance over standalone organic or 2D devices, with enhanced operational stability and environmental resilience. As such, transistors displayed high ON/OFF ratios, sensor showed fast and selective response, and energy devices showed increased power densities meeting the IoT and biomedical applications. The research sets up a new sustainable route for flexible and wearable electronics via hybrid organic-2D architectures. The suggested solution introduces a possible sustainable, high-throughput, and commercially viable electronics path toward future smart technologies."

We propose an all-onchip artificial neural network (ANN) training framework that utilises AMD’s Versal XCVC1902 heterogeneous SoC with a purpose-built batch-normalisation (BN) accelerator to overcome the two main barriers to edge computing: memory bandwidth and batch normalisation layer latency. By hardwiring batch normalisation calculation to form a hardware primitive and using fixed-point arithmetic, the design improves batch normalisation latency from tens of cycles to nine cycles, improving the efficiency of the ANN training process. The hardware-software co-design strategy demonstrates how deep processing unit cores, BN engine based on FPGA fabric, and CPUs can be orchestrated through a unifying abstraction, pointing toward application-specific SoCs that hide low-level scheduling from machine learning developers. The framework is evaluated as an application of real-time functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signal reconstruction, where cloud off-loading is undesirable for privacy and latency reasons. Although evaluated on fNIRS, the tiled batch normalisation engine and zero-copy dataflow can be reused in any ANN training that spends a significant fraction of time in batch normalisation layers."

This paper proposes a Smart Adaptive Beaconing Framework using Fuzzy Logic (SAB-FL) that dynamically adjusts beacon intervals according to real-time network conditions, such as node mobility and residual energy. AODV routing protocol FL-AODV is enhanced with a fuzzy logic-based decision-making system that evaluates delay, energy, and stability when selecting relay nodes. In addition to improving packet delivery ratios, throughput, and end-to-end delays, the proposed framework minimises routing overhead. In dense or highly mobile environments, SAB-FL outperforms traditional GPSR and AODV protocols, providing a robust and energy-efficient geographical routing solution in MANETs."

Active fault tolerant control (AFTC) of automated systems goes to the heart of the matter. This paper treats a new methodology for AFTC based on bond graph (BG) approach modeling. We construct the BG reduced Luenberger observer to study the robust diagnosis of the stringing machine. Tests are applied on the tree compressibility parameter of the stringing machine. Our aim of the robust diagnostic is to detect, to locate and to estimate faults which affect the studied system by generating the residues equations. In order to be effective, the diagnostic system should be robust for residues generation and insensitive to faults. The results are validated by the 20Sim software for the simulation."

The alignment of the reads against references or de-novo assembly becomes a computational bottleneck for portable in-field sequencing, analysis and real-time operation. The base level alignment is performed with the Smith-Waterman or similar algorithms, and has been well studied due to its suitability for hardware implementation. Previous work is limited in its applicability due to its simplifications compared to the complete algorithm as used in state-of-the-art software toolboxes or its focus on the base operation. In this work, we show a system level assessment, implementation and integration with the reference software, highlighting how the computationally cheap backtracking step has to be hardware accelerated to reduce the amount of data transferred to the host. The hardware implementation, which is bit-level equivalent to the software reference, is made freely available online."

With the advancement of technologies, clinical images from imaging devices are communicated to doctors or radiologists in real time via the Internet.

Malicious actors may manipulate medical images to make false insurance claims, provide incorrect diagnoses, or even endanger someone’s life.

Traditional diagnostic methods often produce inaccurate results when distinguishing between different tumor types because these methods depend primarily on radiological interpretation and invasive biopsy. Medical imaging data analysis through artificial i ntelligence (AI) technology has shown promising results through advancements in radiomics, deep learning and hybrid computational models for achieving better diagnostic accuracy. The research survey uses CT imaging as its main focus to provide a complete evaluation of the existing methods which detect, segment, and classify kidney tumors. The research paper “Distinguishing Kidney Tumor Types Using Radiomics Features and Deep Features” functions as the foundation for this evaluation. The study demonstrates a diagnostic method that enhances tumor subtype classification t hrough t he integration of human-developed radiomic descriptors with machine-extracted deep features. The research builds upon this base to evaluate multiple recent artificial intelligence techniques which include attention-based convolutional neural networks, Crayfish Optimization Algorithm optimization frameworks, fuzzy logic system enhancements, modified GoogLeNet architectures for glomerulus classification and ensemble classifiers utilizing multiple learning strategies. A critical analysis of these various methods through comparative analysis allows this survey to determine their advantages and disadvantages as well as their medical uses."

Crucially, a SMN also has a generalized control plane that, unlike SDN, controls all aspects of the cloud including traffic management (e.g., capacity planning) and reliability (e.g., incident routing) at both short (minutes) and large (years) time scales. Just as SDN allows better routing, a SMN improves visibility and enables cross-layer optimizations for faster response to failures and better network planning and operations. Implemented naively, SMN for planetary sc6ale networks requires orders of magnitude larger and more heterogeneous data (e.g., alerts, logs) than SDN. We address this using coarsening — mapping complex data to a more compact abstract representation that has approximately the same effect, and is more scalable, maintainable, and learnable. We show examples including Coarse Bandwidth Logs for capacity planning and Coarse Dependency Graphs for incident routing. Coarse Dependency Graphs improve an incident routing metric from 45% to 78% while for a distributed approach like Scouts the same metric was 22%. We end by discussing how to realize SMN, and suggest cross-layer optimizations and coarsenings for other operational and planning problems in networks."

Point mutations can arise when a hydrogen-bonded proton tunnels between donor and acceptor sites in DNA, transiently creating tautomeric forms that mispair during replication. Despite the elastic way of proton tunneling, we analyze inelastic proton tunneling accompanied by energy exchange with local vibrational/electronic modes and the environment. Within an open-quantum-system framework, we derive Born–Markov master equations for a two-state (double-well) Hamiltonian parameterized by hydrogen-bond geometry and environmental spectral properties. Quantum-chemical parameters are estimated by DFT (B3LYP/6311G, Gaussian09) with water as solvent. We examine temperature depen dence and kinetic isotope effects (H/D). It is shown show that inelastic tunneling can extend tautomer lifetimes and enhance mispairing probabilities.

    "abstract": "In recent years, Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding (DeepJSCC) has demonstrated superior performance over traditional digital schemes in wireless image transmission tasks. However, existing DeepJSCC approaches often overlook three critical challenges in broadcast communication scenarios: bandwidth heterogeneity among users, dynamic bandwidth variations experienced by individual users, and users diverse requirements. To address these issues, we propose a scalable DeepJSCC framework tailored for broadcast communications. This framework enables users to adaptively intercept an appropriate amount of encoded data according to their bandwidth conditions or specific requirements, thereby reconstructing images with corresponding quality. Specifically, the transmitter generates a multi-layered codestream, consisting of multiple base layers for image reconstruction at different resolutions, as well as enhancement layers built upon each base layer to improve visual quality. At the receiver, users can selectively intercept the base layer stream corresponding to their desired resolution, and further receive parts of the associated enhancement layer stream. This design allows for flexible and quality-adaptive image reconstruction based on the amount of data received. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme consistently achieves high-quality reconstruction across various resolutions and under diverse interception conditions."

Notably, methods for detecting large targets, including submarines and sunken ships, differ significantly from those used for small targets. This review systematically highlights advances in magnetic sensing technologies for small target detection. It discusses typical methods and sensor systems for detecting magnetic signals generated by small targets, with a focus on comparing passive, active, and dual-mode methods. Furthermore, the review outlines data processing techniques and solutions for improving sensor response and solving target feature information.

    "abstract": "Although the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) has been adopted as an optimal control strategy for some grid-connected inverters (GCI) studies, certain critical practical challenges are not addressed for real world applications such as noisy measurements, background harmonic voltage, grid impedance variations under weak grid operation, partial state availability and higher power quality. To address this gap, this paper proposes the integration of linear quadratic Gaussian minimum energy estimator LQG (MEE) control with LQR, combining optimal state estimation and feedback control to enhance the performance which in turn resulting in lower total harmonic distortion (THD) in the grid current, guaranteeing improved power quality in a three-phase GCI with an LCL filter in dq frame. In addition, this approach effectively decouples control performance from sensor inaccuracies and grid side disturbances, leading to improved harmonic attenuation, enhanced disturbance rejection, and reduced dependence on additional sensors, reducing hardware costs. To reduce the computational burden of tuning controller parameters, the sensitivity analysis has been illustrated. A simple integral action is presented to guarantee optimal set point (OSP). Then, the augmented state-space model is built by applying the separation theorem to facilitate studying stability analysis. It was validated for the linearized model and the actual nonlinear system, based on eigenvalue trajectories and Lyapunov theorem, respectively. After that, simulation and experimental results validate the performance of the suggested control scheme. A comparative analysis between the proposed method and the sliding mode control (SMC) has been investigated experimentally in this article. The experimental findings emphasize that the proposed solution not only overcomes the practical limitations of LQR but also mitigates THD in the current of the grid by 30%, even under varying operating conditions."

This PM combination makes the proposed motor have high torque under different load conditions. Two different magnet arrangements with different rotor poles are investigated through flux harmonic analysis to obtain higher output torque. Two optimal motor type are selected and compared with two benchmark motors that only have flux-reversal PMs. In order to analyze the torque components of the four motors, a Poynting theory-based torque calculation method is proposed, and more detailed derivation is carried out.

    "abstract": "We demonstrate an all-silicon local area network wavelength division multiplexing (LAN-WDM) transmitter with capacities of 1.6 Tbps and beyond, utilizing 8 traveling wave Mach-Zehnder modulators (TW-MZMs) with 3 dB EO bandwidths of 60 GHz and a lattice-filer-based Gaussian-like-passband 8×1 multiplexer. By using the joint linear and nonlinear equalization algorithm based on cascaded artificial neural network and maximum likelihood sequence estimation (ANN-MLSE), we demonstrate single-channel 250 Gbps four level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM4) with the corresponding bit error ratios (BER) below the 20% soft-decision forward error correction (SD-FEC) threshold of 2E-2. The aggregate bit rates of all 8 channels reach 2 Tbps and 1.6 Tbps for the PAM4 transmissions over 1 km and 10 km single mode fibers, respectively. The energy efficiency and the bandwidth density are as high as 0.18/0.143 pJ/bit and 28.9/36.2 Gbps/mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> for 1.6/2 Tbps transmission.

    "abstract": "High wind-penetration power systems require en-hanced VAR support to address voltage stability challenges, yet relying solely on conventional grid-following wind turbines (GFL-WTs) face insufficient dynamic support while adding new devices poses economic and space constraints. Therefore, this paper pro-poses a novel multi-timescale VAR optimization framework inte-grating grid-forming wind turbines (GFM-WTs) into hybrid dis-crete/continuous VAR resource coordination. First, a refined GFM-WT model with AC/DC dynamic coupling characteristics is developed, employing a continuous combination function to elimi-nate state jumps in current-limited operations. Then, to avoid vir-tual power angle and voltage instability of GFM-WT, a stability region hypersurface projection level set is constructed and the nonlinear stability constraints are replaced by a tangent convex approximation method, which can fully utilize the VAR support capability of the GFM-WTs while ensuring their stability. Third, a bi-level day-ahead and intraday optimization structure is estab-lished, incorporating a gradient-based stability region dynamic correction technique to avoid repetitive computational burdens. Finally, case studies on a modified IEEE 39-bus system validate that the proposed framework can achieve 22.34% reduction in dis-crete device switching at the lowest economic cost with 647, demonstrating enhanced voltage stability and economic viability under high renewables."

    "abstract": "Self-supervised category-level 6D pose estimation has emerged as a task of paramount significance within the field of computer vision. Despite recent advancements, current self-supervised methods grapple with two critical challenges. Primarily, the ability of existing networks to accurately reconstruct object models is constrained by pronounced part-level shape variations across specific categories. Additionally, the persistent many-to-one ambiguity within pixel-to-point cloud correspondences poses a significant barrier to achieving robust performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that includes a Language-Assisted Memory-Encoding Shape Reconstruction (LMR) module and a Coarse-to-Fine Correspondence Optimization (CFCO) module. In the LMR module, language descriptions are leveraged to bridge the gap between virtual and real images, thereby improving the alignment between learned representations and real-world object appearances. Additionally, a memory encoding mechanism is introduced to enhance reconstruction accuracy by capturing fine-grained shape variations. The CFCO module utilizes Hungarian matching to generate one-to-one pseudo labels at both region and pixel levels, providing explicit supervision for the corresponding similarity matrices. Furthermore, this process helps alleviate the many-to-one ambiguity to some extent, leading to more accurate correspondence learning. We evaluate our method on the REAL275 and WILD6D datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our self-supervised approach outperforms existing methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results within the self-supervised framework."

This paper presents a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN)-based dual connectivity controller that intelligently orchestrates handover decisions and interface selection while leveraging RSU collaboration for enhanced V2X communications. The proposed solution introduces a comprehensive 10-dimensional state representation explicitly incorporating RSU proximity, RSRP, SINR, cluster dynamics, and handover history, enabling proactive handover decisions. A sophisticated multi-objective reward function balances handover frequency against performance gains through explicit handover cost penalties and ping-pong detection mechanisms. RSUs serve as local orchestrators, predicting optimal handover timing based on vehicle trajectories and cluster formations. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the DDQN controller achieves 94.5% PDR, 13.6 ms average latency, and 0.694 interface diversity, while reducing the ping-pong ratio to only 5%. The system demonstrates real-time feasibility with only 1.5% processing overhead and 323.8 ms average step time in 50-vehicle scenarios, proving balanced performance across multiple objectives."

    "abstract": "In music source separation, a standard data augmentation technique involves creating new training examples by randomly combining instrument stems from different songs. However, these randomly mixed samples lack the natural coherence of real music, as their stems do not share a consistent beat or tonality, often resulting in a cacophony. Despite this apparent distribution shift, random mixing has been widely adopted due to its effectiveness. In this work, we investigate why random mixing improves performance when training a state-of-the-art music source separation model and analyze the factors that cause performance gains to plateau despite the theoretically limitless number of possible combinations. We further explore the impact of beat and tonality mismatches on separation performance. Beyond analyzing random mixing, we introduce ways to further enhance its effectiveness. First, we explore a multi-segment sampling strategy that increases the diversity of training examples by selecting multiple segments for the target source. Second, we incorporate a digital parametric equalizer, a fundamental tool in music production, to maximize the timbral diversity of random mixes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model trained with only 100 songs from the MUSDB18-HQ dataset, combined with our proposed methods, achieves competitive performance to a BS-RNN model trained with 1,750 additional songs."

    "abstract": "In additive manufacturing process, the fusion of multi-source sensing signals and cross-modal interaction are crucial to improve the accuracy of fault diagnosis. Most of the existing methods focus mainly on signal time-series features, but the spatial and time-frequency features were always ignored. In this study, a multi-modal spatio-temporal fusion network (MSTNet) with a three-branch synergetic architecture is proposed. The network integrates acoustic emission (AE) and thermal modalities to achieve fault diagnosis in additive manufacturing. Firstly, a channel-enhanced Mamba (CEMamba) architecture is designed to achieve feature extraction of multi-channel frequency-space joint signals generated by continuous wavelet transform (CWT), gramian angular difference fields (GADF), and recurrence plot. The CEMamba architecture can effectively capture the multi-channel features of AE signals including spatial, time-series, and time-frequency features. Secondly, the bi-directional gated recurrent unit is introduced to capture the dynamic evolution laws of AE signals. Specially, a novel physics-based loss function is designed to constrain the physics informed neural network (PINN) for generating high-resolution thermal modalities. Finally, an adaptive and dynamic weighting mechanism during the feature fusion enables the information complementarity of cross-modal features. When tested on two manufacturing datasets of selective laser melting and laser directed energy deposition, the fault diagnosis accuracy of MSTNet achieves 99.71% and 99.55%, respectively. The scalability of MSTNet is further verified on two public datasets of CWRU and Jiangnan University bearing."

A major limitation affecting the effectiveness of evolutionary feature construction is its failure to fully leverage the large number of building blocks evaluated during the evolutionary process.

This library collects up to 10,000 trees and subtrees during the evolutionary process, with a design that adapts linear scaling and considers tree complexity to enhance both accuracy and generalization performance. To manage a large semantic library, we employ a ball tree and an instance selection mechanism, optimizing computational and memory resources. Furthermore, a positive-negative search mechanism and a semantic library-guided mutation operator are introduced to further improve the effectiveness of the semantic library in feature construction. Experimental validation on 120 datasets demonstrates that our semantic library-based genetic programming approach significantly outperforms several symbolic regression and machine learning algorithms, highlighting its superior performance."

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting pCR to neoadjuvant chemo-therapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients is crucial for achieving personalized treatment strategies. pCR is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer in the breast. To this end, we propose a dual-path GCN–Transformer network (DGT-Net) to integrate ultrasound and pathological image features for early pCR prediction. In the ultrasound pathway, DGT-Net constructed a multimodal knowledge graph to aggregate information on tumor macromorphology, blood perfusion patterns, and tissue elasticity. In the pathology pathway, DGT-Net extracted microhistological patterns and their spatial structures from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained pathological slides. By introducing an attention score–based dynamic key-patch selection method, a pathology graph is constructed to identify highly discriminative tissue regions. Both pathways employ Transformer encoders to capture complex relationships across modalities, and the outputs are fused through a weighted soft voting strategy to produce robust pCR prediction results. This study included data from 181 breast cancer patients, and experimental results show that DGT-Net outperforms several advanced models, achieving an AUC of 0.891 and an accuracy of 86.2%. Moreover, the diagnostic performance achieved by combining multimodal ultrasound and pathological image information exceeded that of using ultrasound alone (AUC: 0.880) or pathology alone (AUC: 0.786). DGT-Net provides a reliable, non-invasive method for early pCR prediction and has the potential to support clinical decision-making in NAC regimen design."

To address this gap, we propose a three-layered CTI framework that unifies learning and adaptation across heterogeneous clouds. The first layer implements a two-tier federated learning (FL) strategy, developing two global models: <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">MLP-SimiFed</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">MLP-Non-SimiFed</i>, within each industry cloud to manage scalability and heterogeneity.

    "abstract": "The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical diagnostics has highlighted an essential need for transparent and interpretable systems, particularly in the field of mental health. The opaque decision-making in “black-box” AI models creates a challenge in clinical settings: they risk losing trust or causing uncritical reliance. This paradox jeopardizes mental healthcare, where skepticism or unwarranted confidence in AI can harm patient care. Effective explainability mechanisms are therefore essential not only to earn trust but to support responsible use by allowing clinicians to critically assess and verify AI-driven outputs. Thus, we propose a novel explainable AI (XAI) pipeline for automated depression diagnosis, designed to integrate both system-level and human-level interpretability. This dual approach is vital in clinical settings, as it combines rigorous statistical validation with clear, actionable insights that enhance practitioner confidence in AI-generated diagnoses. The pipeline leverages deep learning models for classification, augmented by traditional system-level XAI techniques and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced Large Language Model (LLM). With the integration of LLMs, the system translates abstract system-level explanations into understandable, natural language narratives. This provides a crucial cross-verification step that fosters calibrated trust: it mitigates the dual risks of under-trust, by providing a clear rationale, and over-trust, by flagging diagnostic inconsistencies within the AI models. This capability is critical for ensuring both user trust and satisfaction, as it empowers practitioners to critically assess and validate AI-driven insights. Through comprehensive human evaluations conducted by medical professionals, this approach demonstrates high alignment with clinical diagnostic indicators, underscoring the value of combining system-level and human-level explanations to make complex AI processes transparent and clinically meaningful. Validated across three diverse datasets-KangNing, EDAIC-WOZ, and CALLM-each presenting unique structural challenges from structured clinical inquiries to narrative-driven dialogues, our method bridges the gap between technical AI outputs and practitioner understanding, marking a significant advancement toward a trust-based, widely adoptable AI diagnostic tool in mental health care. By introducing a comprehensive framework for combining statistical rigor with narrative clarity, this work represents a critical step toward closing the gap between black-box AI systems and real-world clinical adoption. While our study is limited to depression diagnosis, the proposed framework illustrates a pathway toward explainable clinical AI systems. Future work may explore its adaptability to other medical contexts."

However, achieving both real-time performance and long-horizon scalability remains an open challenge. In this paper, we present Hi-RQCT (Hierarchical Residual-Quantized Causal Transformer), which generates high-quality lifelike 3D human motions by training a single transformer model. Hi-RQCT consists of only two main components: 1) RVQ-VAE, a hierarchical residual vector quantization variational autoencoder, which discretizes continuous motion sequences with high precision; 2) Hierarchical Causal Transformer, responsible for generating the base motion sequences in an autoregressive manner while simultaneously inferring residuals across different layers. Experimental results demonstrate that Hi-RQCT can generate smooth and continuous motion sequences up to 260 frames (13 seconds), surpassing the 196 frames (10 seconds) length limitation of existing datasets like HumanML3D. On the HumanML3D test set, our model achieves the best quantitative performance, and the generated motions also exhibit highly realistic and expressive visual quality in qualitative evaluations."

Thus, integrating clean-energy microgrids (MGs) with advanced thermal management systems is paramount. In this context, Phase-Change Materials (PCMs) have gained significant attention due to their potential to enhance the thermal performance of buildings, providing economical benefits. PCMs are thermal storage media that operate on the principle of latent heat storage, i.e., they absorb or release thermal energy through phase transitions while maintaining an almost constant temperature. When thermal energy is supplied, a PCM changes its physical state from solid to liquid or vice versa. Due to their significantly higher energy density compared to sensible heat storage systems, PCMs are well-suited for compact and efficient thermal management applications."

This research proposes an automated system for rice leaf disease detection using transfer learning models, specifically VGG16 and Inception V3. The dataset used in this work consists 2,628 labeled rice leaf images which obtained from Kaggle and used for model training and evaluation. The models were fine-tuned and tested under various hyper-parameter configurations, including batch sizes of 32,64 and number of epochs 5,10,20,30 to assess their diagnostic performance. The results demonstrate that both models are capable of accurately detecting multiple rice leaf diseases. The validation accuracy of both models improved with increased training epochs. However, Inception V3 demonstrated a more consistent and steeper accuracy gain across epochs rising from 91.21% at 5 epochs to 96.09% at 30 epochs while VGG16 showed a comparatively slower improvement, reaching only 90.23% at the same point. Automated rice leaf disease detection model is significant for precision agriculture, as the proposed system can support real-time, scalable, and non-invasive disease monitoring. By enabling earlier and more reliable diagnosis, such approaches can lead to more informed decision-making which reduced crop losses, and enhanced agricultural productivity."

Experiments demonstrate a recall of 0.956 on the test set, surpassing LightGBM (0.721) and artificial neural networks (0.667), thus improving the identification of potential audit cases while maintaining an optimal false positive rate. The main contribution is the practical integration of these techniques for audit selection in operational environments, validated on a large-scale, sensitive dataset that reflects the real-world challenge of limited positive cases."

Early identification plays a vital role since the condition frequently shows no observable symptoms during its beginning phases, resulting in late discovery and diminished chances of survival. The proposed approach uses support vector machine with hyperparameter optimization to enhance model generalization and prevent overfitting. Comprehensive data preprocessing combined with effective class balancing techniques contributed to the model's robust performance. The refined SVM demonstrated exceptional accuracy of 99.1% in differentiating malignant and benign tumors, substantially exceeding the performance metrics of previous machine learning approaches referenced in the literature. These results demonstrate strong potential for computational methods to complement traditional diagnostic procedures, potentially reducing the need for invasive procedures and enabling more timely interventions to improve patient outcomes."

The proposed circuit is made up of a high-output-current amplifier driving a pulse transformer that may be switched in or out of the DC supply path. It addresses the challenge of injecting high-voltage impulses into a regulated power rail that exhibits a very low impedance, and its small-footprint and low-cost make it suitable for System-in-Package applications requiring embedded tests.

    "abstract": "It is a big step forward in medical technology that robots driven by AI are now being used in minimally invasive cancer treatments. The topic of this essay is the creation and use of smart computer systems that can make cancer surgeries more accurate, faster, and safer. When it comes to cancer, traditional surgery methods often involve complicated processes that can cause long healing times, big scars, and a higher risk of problems. On the other hand, minimally invasive treatments that uses AI-driven computer systems to help make smaller cuts, lower blood loss, and faster healing times look like a good option. AI systems, such as machine learning models, are used to help surgeons make decisions in real time by looking at patient data, scan results, and the progress of the surgery. When AI is added to robotic systems, it gives the surgeon more fine control over the tools, which lets them remove tumours with more skill and accuracy. In addition, these systems can have adaptable feedback features that let them keep learning and improving surgery methods based on the data and results they have collected. This article talks about a number of clinical studies, use cases, and technological advances that show how AI-powered robots can lower the risks of standard cancer surgery. We talk about the problems with integrating systems, social issues, and what this technology could do in the future. Finally, robotic surgery driven by AI is going to change the way cancer is treated by allowing a personalized method that does the least amount of harm while increasing the chances of success."

A fast and accurate topology identification can help achieving the tasks of load monitoring, operation and control of power distribution system as well as outage detection. In this paper, we propose a novel and ultra-fast topology identification method. By adapting the subset sum method with a hierarchical structure, the overall grid topology can be inferred from fewer samples of smart meter power measurements. Such techniques can be applied in real time under the scenarios with fast topology change, and the proposed hierarchical algorithm is also robust against measurement noises."

Computing-in-Memory (CIM) architectures have demonstrated distinctive advantages by eliminating redundant data transfers between processing and computing units. Conventional resistive CIM arrays experience intrinsic issues with static power consumption and voltage drops caused by current flow. Compared to resistive ones, CIM array based on ferroelectric capacitors (FeCAPs) are more energy efficient. However, previous researches show that amplifiers are necessary in FeCAP crossbar array (FCA) readout circuits and dominate the power consumption in a ferroelectric capacitive computing system. In this paper, a novel FCA-based CIM accelerator is proposed. Direct output of bitline voltage is achieved without using power-hungry operational amplifier (OPAMP). The use of two-terminal computational units also reduces the impact of finite ON/OFF ratio on the system’s parallelism and accuracy. Additionally, an FCA mapping technique designed for binary neural networks (BNNs) is presented. Based on our analysis, the proposed FCA-based CIM accelerator designed at the 180-nm process node achieves an energy efficiency of 121 TOPS/W and an inference accuracy of 82.7% on the CIFAR-10 dataset."

    "abstract": "Agriculture is fundamental to human survival and plays a significant part in the global economy. The world’s population is growing, leading to increased need for food. Climate change impacts agriculture, including weed control. Weeds are undesired plants that compete with plants for nutrients and sunshine, reducing crop quality and productivity. Weeding manually can be time-consuming and labor-intensive as both crops and weeds may appear identical. Artificial intelligence approaches such as deep learning can handle the challenge of crop and weed categorization. A deep learning-based classification system has been used to classify weed and crop based on images. This paper investigates deep learning-based crop and weed categorization with five advanced models as YOLOv8, DETR, WeedGAN, SkipResNet, and ECENet+GradCAM tested on three benchmark datasets CWD30, DeepWeed, and RF100. The accuracy, average precision, and threat score of each model are evaluated. ECENet+GradCAM performs the best among them on all datasets, with accuracy of 0.97 on CWD30, 0.99 on DeepWeed, and 0.96 on RF100. Improved interpretability in precision agricultural applications is guaranteed by its improved explainability. According to the results, ECENet+GradCAM is a dependable option for precise and long-lasting weed detection because of its efficacy in practical settings. Since YOLOv8 exhibits robust real-time detection capabilities, it may be used for quick and effective weed identification. Therefore, the proposed approach provides a deep learning-based method for precise and comprehensible crop and weed categorization, maximizing performance in a range of agricultural settings and facilitating real-time and sustainable farming applications."

Using structural equation modeling with data from 387 employees across five industries implementing generative AI systems, we found that AI relational safety significantly predicts digital transformation success, with human-AI collaborative efficacy serving as a significant mediator. The relationship was further influenced by the complexity of generative AI systems and the level of organizational AI maturity.

    "abstract": "With the continued integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs), utilities face unforeseen challenges in operations, including understanding their dynamic performance. To reveal the dynamic response of grid-tied IBRs, measurement data analysis can be conducted in the frequency domain. To this end, signal processing techniques have been employed to construct spectrograms, which are time-frequency representations of a signal’s spectral information. These spectrograms contain useful features about the system’s modes and their evolution. However, with IBRs being introduced to the grid, such methods require adaptation. This paper describes a comprehensive approach for obtaining spectrograms and post-processing them for better visualization and enhancement of mode features. In particular, it is shown how, by adjusting the spectrum’s baseline and using thresholding, the resulting spectrograms make it easier to observe the dynamics of interest. The proposed methodology is tested on real PMU data."

    "abstract": "One of the largest sources of Renewable Energy is Wave Energy. The global gross Wave Energy resource is estimated to be more than 3TWh. With growing effects of climate change becoming abundantly clear there has been a growing demand for renewable energy. India has a large population and thus large energy needs. Since India has committed to transition to green energy, it is essential explore the potential sources of clean energy in India. Wave Power is a clean source of energy that can be harvested in India due to its long coastline. Therefore predicting Wave Power and variables it depends on is important. Machine Learning is a useful method which can be used for predicting Wave Power given the historical data of climate variables in Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea. Since LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is one of the important Deep Learning approaches that are used to predict time series data. This study aims to predict Wave Power along Indian Coastline by predicting significant Wave Height and Mean Wave Period, using historical geospatial data of climate variables. The variables used are Sea Level Pressure (SLP), Windspeed, significant height of Total Swell and Significant Wave Height, from 1979 to 2021. The LSTM is applied on the data and predictions are made on the ports on Indian Coastlines.MSE (Mean Squared Error) is used to identify overfitting and Regularization applied to overcome it. Model output is measure using metrics like RMSE and Coefficient of Determination."

This research presents an artificial intelligence-augmented surveillance system designed for real-time anomaly identification and threat evaluation. The system extracts spatiotemporal features to classify and predict high-risk activities including unauthorized perimeter breaches, loitering anomalies, altercations, weapon brandishing, running, fighting and other suspicious behavior by combining live CCTV telemetry with modern advanced computer vision pipelines and deep learning models. It also notes non-human invasions like wild animals crossing residential or restricted areas. This method guarantees exact detection and fast response by using a hybrid DNN combines with CNNs for spatial feature encoding and LSTM networks for sequential behavioral analysis. Furthermore, enabled by low-latency alert distribution is highfidelity video stream analysis and context-aware decisionmaking. By reducing reliance on human supervision and so improving security intelligence, the modular architecture is intended for scalability and generalization across many surveillance systems, so optimizing false-positive suppression, autonomy of security operations, and proactive mitigating of threats.

Although PIM architectures based on various memory devices have been developed, it is challenging to rapidly estimate performance of chips in the early design stage. In this paper, we propose a modular and parameterized simulation framework DDSim, for design and rapid estimation of digital PIM architectures. The proposed framework supports fast simulation of PIM architectures at three levels: chip level, tile level, and array level, providing various trade-offs between speed and accuracy. To enable rapid simulation, the framework allow users to customize the parameters of the PIM architecture with pre-synthesis logic units, instead of estimating hardware performance at the transistor level every time. In addtion, the framework is tightly coupled with Pytorch-based DNN framework to enable automatic extraction and mapping of DNN models on digital PIM architectures. We demonstrate the benchmark performance of the proposed framework on several typical DNN models to prove its ability to fast simulate digital PIM architectures."

Despite growing interest in battery electric vehicles (BEVs), adoption lags due to inadequate charging infrastructure. This study applies a machine learning approach to identify and prioritize key charging infrastructure features that can enhance BEV adoption. A sequential mixed-methods design was used, starting with in-depth interviews with 15 nonBEV users to explore essential features, followed by a survey of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1, 5 1 1}$</tex> participants for validation. A Random Forest model ranked features based on their importance across five adoptionrelated variables. Customer support, charging availability, and interoperability emerged as primary priorities, while charging speed, payment flexibility, and home charging were identified as secondary. These findings highlight the need for consumeroriented, accessible, and dependable infrastructure to support sustainable transportation transitions in highly polluted regions. Theoretically, this study advances the understanding of technology adoption by integrating behavioral insights with data-driven feature prioritization in the context of sustainable mobility."

The BraTS 2024 initiative addresses this critical need by providing the most extensive collection of expert-annotated MRI data for post-treatment gliomas. Building on this opportunity, we propose a multi-label segmentation approach using a 3D U-Net architecture for post-treatment MRI analysis. Our framework aims to precisely delineate four distinct tumor sub-regions: Enhancing Tissue, Surrounding Non-Enhancing T2/FLAIR Hyperintensity, Non-Enhancing Tumor Core, and Resection Cavity. It leverages the volumetric nature of MRI data through 3D convolutions, allowing superior spatial contextual understanding and feature extraction. Preliminary results demonstrate that our framework can accommodate the inherent complexities of post-treatment tissue characteristics, with significant improvements over baseline models. Thus, it provides a solid foundation for automated post-treatment glioma monitoring."

To address this, we present a comprehensive framework for synthetic ECG waveform generation using multiple deep learning-based autoencoder architectures. The explored models include LSTM Autoencoder (LSTMAE), Convolutional Autoencoder (CNNAE), Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Denoising Autoencoder (DAE). These models are trained to reconstruct ECG signals and are evaluated for their ability to generate realistic synthetic ECG data. The reconstruction quality was assessed using training loss (MSE), Pearson Correlation Coefficient, and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Among all models, the CNNAE reached the best performance with a Pearson correlation of 0.999966, and an SNR of 51.184 dB, followed closely by the LSTMAE. In contrast, the VAE and DAE showed relatively lower reconstruction fidelity. These results demonstrate the potential of convolutional and various other autoencoders for generating high-quality synthetic ECG signals, which can support data augmentation, privacy-preserving research, and benchmarking of biomedical signal processing algorithms."

Hence, this paper discusses a grid-tied Photovoltaic (PV) system for EV charging stations, focusing on dynamic energy management to maximize solar generation benefits and minimize grid strain. The system uses a high-gain Modified Luo converter to boost the PV system’s DC voltage output. Incremental Conductance (INC)-based Maximum power Point Tracking (MPPT) technique is a control method used in PV systems to ensure operation at the maximum power point under varying environmental conditions. Further, it responds quickly to dynamic weather conditions, making it particularly suitable for grid-connected and off-grid PV applications where efficiency and stability are critical. A single-phase Voltage Source Inverter (VSI), which links the PV system to the grid, receives the enhanced output of the Modified Luo converter. Additionally, an LC filter is used to reduce unwanted harmonics, smooth voltage and current waveforms, and improve power quality in power electronic systems. The proposed approach uses MATLAB/SIMULINK to model the proposed approach. The efficiency is noted to be $94.3 \\%$ with a Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of $\\mathbf{2. 1 2 \\%}$."

While Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes have been the primary focus of research, diabetes encompasses various subtypes, including gestational diabetes, monogenic forms such as Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young, and secondary diabetes, which arises from underlying conditions or treatments. These subtypes present distinct challenges in terms of diagnosis, classification, and treatment. Machine learning has emerged as a transformative tool in healthcare, offering significant advancements in disease diagnosis, prediction, and classification. This study proposes a machine learning-based model aimed at classifying the broad spectrum of diabetes subtypes. We utilize advanced algorithms to differentiate between Type 1, Type 2, gestational diabetes, MODY, and secondary diabetes. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 90% and a weighted F1 score of 0.9, indicating the effectiveness of machine learning in handling complex, multidimensional healthcare data. The results demonstrate the potential of machine learning to improve early diagnosis, optimize treatment plans, and aid in personalized healthcare strategies. This work contributes to expanding the scope of diabetes classification, emphasizing the importance of addressing less-studied subtypes and advancing medical science through the application of AI."

We demonstrate that increasing the MTU size significantly enhances the performance of both middleboxes and end hosts. To bridge MTU mismatches at network borders, we introduce PacketExpress gateway (PXGW), an MTU-translating gateway that dynamically adjusts packet sizes for cross-traffic. PXGW merges and splits TCP payloads on the fly and tunnels UDP packets, ensuring seamless adaptation. Also, we propose F-PMTUD, a new path MTU discovery algorithm that determines the path MTU within a single round-trip without relying on ICMP. Our preliminary evaluation shows that the PXGW prototype achieves 1.45 Tbps of packet forwarding throughput using only 8 CPU cores. After dynamic conversion, 94% of transmitted TCP packets are 9000 B jumbo frames, indicating that most flows were effectively converted into large segments, thereby demonstrating the system's efficiency and scalability. We also find that large-MTU packets, made available via PXGW, enhance end-host performance by up to 2.5X."

    "abstract": "The substantial increase of distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems in low-voltage distribution grids has resulted in an escalating problem of exceeding voltage upper limits due to reverse power flow. Numerous strategies have been suggested to address the issue of voltage violating the voltage upper limits. Nevertheless, the conventional approaches are essentially open-loop control methods and exhibit steady-state errors. In addition, unbalanced loads or single-phase PV can cause traditional methods to be ineffective. This article proposes an adaptive virtual impedance-based closed-loop voltage control strategy for smart transformer (ST)- interfacing distribution grid. Utilizing adaptive virtual impedance-based closed-loop control, ST can regulate the maximum bus voltage of the distribution grid at the voltage threshold without static error, hence enabling the control of other buses within the voltage threshold when reverse power flow occurs. Besides, as the proposed control strategy is implemented in the abc control coordinate system, it can still effectively regulate the maximum bus voltage at the voltage threshold in the presence of unbalanced loads or the sudden connection of single-phase PV systems. Furthermore, to ensure the stability of the system, impedance-based stability is analyzed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulation based upon real data of a radial distribution feeder and a simplified ST-interfacing distribution grid experiment."

To address these issues, we propose an adaptive torque controller based on an interaction torque model guided by a transparent assistance strategy. The torque controller is designed using the robust model predictive control algorithm, with an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to dynamically adjust the controller parameters. The interaction torque model can estimate future interaction torques to support the model predictive controller. Moreover, the transparent assistance strategy guides the design of the interaction torque reference, ensuring the preservation of the user’s natural exertion patterns during the assistance, thereby creating the sensation of lifting a lighter object for the user. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed transparent assistance strategy effectively maintains the user’s natural exertion patterns while providing assistance. In addition, the proposed adaptive torque controller significantly enhances the torque control accuracy."

    "abstract": "Cost misperformance, when final construction costs exceed a client's approved budget, continues to be a challenge when procuring infrastructure delivery worldwide. Traditional explanations often emphasize individual and organizational errors and/or biases, while overlooking the institutional contexts that shape decision-making. Our paper extends the Fifth Hand, an emergent theory of project behavior, by embedding it within a neo-institutional perspective, linking micro-level ecological rationality with meso-level organizational pressures and macro-level institutional logics. We integrate isomorphic mechanisms (e.g., coercive, mimetic, normative) with institutional logics (e.g., professional [cost control]; market [competitiveness], collaborative [risk-sharing]) to explain the recurrence and legitimacy of behavioral patterns across infrastructure projects. The Fifth Hand is thus mapped to isomorphic pressures and institutional logics, illustrating how they shape a project's cost performance. By adopting a multi-level, institutional lens, we strengthen the Fifth Hand's explanatory foundation by connecting individual and organizational decisions to broader structural and normative forces. We conclude by outlining research directions to explore how isomorphic mechanisms and institutional logics evolve across projects, interact over time, and sustain cost misperformance."

    "abstract": "General aviation pilots who encounter hazardous weather face a heightened risk of fatal accidents compared to those in other sectors of aviation. To help avoid unplanned weather encounters, accurate information on cloud type and sky condition can enhance situational awareness and hazard recognition. Among available weather information resources, ground-based webcam networks are growing for aviation meteorology and other interests such as wildfire monitoring. These webcams can provide near real-time visual weather information to pilots, especially in regions of complex terrain where traditional weather observation methods may lack adequate spatial and temporal coverage. To harness the benefits from webcams while reducing the need for manual interpretation, transfer learning is applied using off-the-shelf convolutional neural networks on a newly constructed meteorological dataset. This dataset, consisting of more than 15 500 rigorously labeled images from public webcam networks, is categorized into nine cloud types and weather conditions relevant to general aviation. Leveraging a five-model ensemble approach with the Inception-v3 architecture, a validation accuracy of 97.1% is achieved. Dataset classes are grouped into those that are typically considered nonhazardous or hazardous to general aviation operations, and a hazard-based classification accuracy of 99.5% is attained with the ensemble model."

This paper presents a hybrid semi-supervised learning framework for classifying sitting postures utilizing solely webcam input, thereby obviating the necessity for wearables or specialized sensors. The framework combines expert-driven clustering with pseudo-labeling to enhance a limited collection of labeled samples into a robust training dataset. Beginning with 10 manually labeled images, four datasets were produced by augmenting with 20 pseudo-labeled instances each, utilizing various clustering methodologies. Four machine learning models—XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)—were trained and assessed based on accuracy, F1-score, AUC, and training duration. LightGBM attained an advantageous equilibrium of performance and efficiency, yielding an F1-score of 0.9805 and the minimal training duration of 24.27 seconds. Although Random Forest achieved the highest F1-score (0.9856), its prolonged training duration (495.21 seconds) restricts its real-time usability. The framework exhibited significant generalization on previously unobserved student data, signifying resilience to individual postural variability and camera angles. The suggested method facilitates scalable and economical implementation in actual classrooms, providing a pragmatic solution for posture monitoring in digital learning settings."

    "abstract": "Advanced deep learning architectures, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have been widely applied in audio, bioacoustic, and biomedical signal analysis, especially in data-scarce environments. While gated RNNs remain effective, they can be relatively over-parameterised and less training-efficient in some regimes [1], [2], while linear RNNs tend to fall short in capturing the complexity inherent in bio-signals. To address these challenges, we propose the Parallel Delayed Memory Unit (PDMU), a delay-gated state-space module for short-term temporal credit assignment targeting audio and bioacoustic signals, which enhances short-term temporal state interactions and memory efficiency via a gated delay-line mechanism. Unlike previous Delayed Memory Units (DMU) that embed temporal dynamics into the delay-line architecture, the PDMU further compresses temporal information into vector representations using Legendre Memory Units (LMU). This design serves as a form of causal attention, allowing the model to dynamically adjust its reliance on past states and improve real-time learning performance. Notably, in low-information scenarios, the gating mechanism behaves similarly to skip connections by bypassing state decay and preserving early representations, thereby facilitating long-term memory retention. The PDMU is modular, supporting parallel training and sequential inference, and can be easily integrated into existing linear RNN frameworks. Furthermore, we introduce bidirectional, efficient, and spiking variants of the architecture, each offering additional gains in performance or energy efficiency. Experimental results on diverse audio and biomedical benchmarks demonstrate that the PDMU significantly enhances both memory capacity and overall model performance."

    "abstract": "Permanent magnet vernier motors (PMVM) exhibit great potential in direct-drive application scenarios. As no-load and on-load performance both affect their overall operational smoothness and reliability, both conditions must be considered during optimization to meet the specific application requirements. However, the high-order harmonics of PMVM make the electromagnetic calculation more time-consuming than permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM). Therefore, in this article, a surrogate-model-driven staged sequential multicondition and multi-objective optimization (MOO) method for PMVM is proposed, aiming to comprehensively optimize the motor performance under both no-load and on-load conditions with reduced computational cost. (1) Unlike traditional methods that involve redundant calculations for both no-load and on-load cases, this article employs a surrogate model-driven staged sequential optimization strategy to sequentially optimize the noload and on-load performance. This method optimizes the on-load condition electromagnetic performance while maintaining nearoptimal no-load performance, thereby achieving multi-condition optimization with reduced computational resources. (2) The optimization results are validated using the finite element method (FEM) and PMVM prototype experimental verification. The optimization results indicate that the proposed optimization method achieves  10% reduction of the computational cost compared with the traditional surrogate-driven optimization method, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method for PMVM optimization. The saved computational cost varies with the complexity of the motor topology. The proposed optimization method can be extended to the optimization problems of different types of motors with more complex motor topologies, considering multiple operating conditions or multiphysics optimization."

Specifically, the reliability of the solder joint of LED packages is predicted based on Transient Thermal Analysis and Scanning Acoustic Microscopy data from a large measurement campaign. The impact of using full temporal information vs measurements at individual datapoints is investigated as well as the benefit of including the SAM data, and different ways of presenting the TTA information, either as a full curve or as expert-selected features. The impact of formatting categorical information of solder and LED package type as one-hot encoding or using embeddings is considered. Finally, the performance for Pass/Fail predictions of the best identified model with a model architecture developed on a similar dataset is compared. We identified the most relevant sources of information for predicting the behavior and the best format for the data, which helps guide the choice for future model architectures."

    "abstract": "Radio-frequency (RF) signal processing has seen significant advancements with the advent of deep learning, providing more accurate and efficient solutions for tasks such as signal classification and generation. However, most existing methods are heavily dependent on large labeled datasets, which are often scarce and costly to obtain in real-world RF environments. Furthermore, these approaches tend to be task-specific, limiting their ability to generalize across various RF applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes RF-MAE, a self-supervised adaptive frequency masked autoencoder. RF-MAE leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) to capture intrinsic patterns from large-scale unlabeled RF data. Central to RF-MAE is a novel Adaptive Frequency Masked (AFM) strategy, which dynamically masks frequency components based on their energy distribution. Supported by a robust theoretical foundation, AFM ensures the model focuses on the most informative signal components, thereby enhancing generalization across RF tasks. By pretraining on unlabeled data and fine-tuning on specific tasks, RF-MAE significantly reduces the reliance on labeled datasets while improving adaptability across diverse RF signal processing tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that RF-MAE consistently outperforms traditional models, underscoring its potential to generalize across tasks and deliver superior performance in a wide range of RF signal applications."

This study proposes an algorithm for optimising cluster heads and relay nodes that utilises a modified gravitational search algorithm (MGSA-ORS). The proposed protocol is compared with existing approaches, such as LEACH, I-LEACH, and LEACH-KH. As a result of simulation results, MGSA-ORS significantly reduces the energy consumption, stability period, and throughput of networks of any size.

    "abstract": "The massive growth of data has brought vigorous vitality to Internet-of-Things (IoT). It has also brought new challenges, such as confidentiality privacy protection and redundant data transmission. Concerning this regard, data aggregation serves as an efficient technique to minimize the transmission frequency among massive objects in smart grid(SG). By aggregating a large amount of the same type of data while satisfying the protection of user privacy. With the advent of the post-quantum era, a good aggregation scheme must provide quantum resistance while ensuring the secure aggregation of ciphertext power data. However, the excessive overhead limits anti-quantum algorithms from being widely used in SG where resource devices are limited. Therefore, it is an important part of the current private data security aggregation technology to find a low cost and lightweight inverse quantum algorithm to achieve user data security aggregation. In this paper, we propose an improved NTRU-based cryptosystem with multidimensional coding, referred to as multidimensional coding NTRU (MC-NTRU). and use the lattice batch signature technique, which improves the efficiency of the scheme while satisfying the anti-quantum attack. Based on these, we design the multidimensional auditable lattice-based privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme(MA-PPDA) for privacy data on resource-limited IoT devices such as smart grids. In addition to this, the scheme achieves fault tolerance of the scheme by adding zeros and random numbers to the user data. The comparative study against existing approaches demonstrates that the proposed scheme not only adheres to critical security aspects including user privacy, data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity, but also decreases both communication and computational burdens on the system. This makes our scheme particularly apt for IoT environments characterized by constrained device resources."

To the best of our knowledge, this paper develops the first methods that accurately identify/eliminate only the problematic attacked sensor data presented to a sequence estimation/ regression algorithm under any attack from our attack model. The approach does not assume a known form for the statistical model of the sensor data, allowing data-driven and machine learning sequence estimation/ regression algorithms to be protected. A simple protection approach for attackers not endowed with knowledge of the details of our protection approach is first developed, followed by additional processing for attacks based on protection system knowledge. Experimental results show that the simple approach achieves performance indistinguishable from that for an approach which knows which sensors are attacked. For cases where the attacker has knowledge of the protection approach, experimental results indicate the additional processing can be configured so that the worst-case degradation under the additional processing and a large number of sensors attacked can be made significantly smaller than the worst-case degradation of the simple approach, and close to an approach which knows which sensors are attacked, with just a slight degradation under no attacks. Mathematical descriptions of the worst-case attacks are used to demonstrate the additional processing will provide similar advantages for cases for which we do not have numerical results. All the data-driven/machine learning processing used in our approaches employ only unattacked training data."

    "abstract": "Automated short answer marking, which was recently introduced, is the next big thing in educational evaluation. It tackles scalability issues and makes the processes very efficient with its natural language processing and intelligent algorithms. Constant, real-time, and unbiased feedback is the essence of this technology, thus replacing manual grading methods. The presented model encompasses multiple BERT models including Roberta and Distil BERT for generation of word embeddings for both student answers and reference texts. Employment of cosine similarity makes the model semantically compare two responses resulting in a score between 0 and 1. DistilBERT and RoBERTa were used to create contextual word embeddings to capture the meaning of students’ answers. The embeddings of both models were combined by concatenating them, so the strengths of each model could be used in the merged representation. DistilBERT and RoBERTa were used in combination with different ML models and DL models. The model that reported the highest R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> score was Linear Regression with a score of 0.91, while the best-performing DL model was BiRNN reporting a R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> score of 0.80. However, it was observed that the DL models reported comparatively lower MSE and MAE values than the ML models. DL Model is more accurate in terms of absolute error, i.e., its predictions are numerically closer to the actual values on average."

The unpredictable availability of channels and frequent topology changes present a challenge to routing in such environments. To improve communication performance in Cognitive MANETs, an efficient routing approach is presented that integrates dynamic channel selection with dominant set-based clustering (DCA-DS). Based on a greedy dominating set algorithm, the network is organised into stable clusters, and communication channels are selected dynamically in response to spectrum availability and network conditions. With the proposed method, the network is organised into stable clusters using a greedy dominating set algorithm. Communication channels are selected dynamically according to the spectrum availability and network conditions."

This study evaluates the economic viability of energy communities using data from 1,300 Flemish households. Two configurations are analysed: communities of households with existing PV systems and communities with joint investments in new PV. For existing PV setups, sharing surplus energy often results in higher costs for PV owners, especially under current fixed participation fees. In shared PV investments, community-level payback periods can be attractive, but individual results vary widely. Equal investment strategies lead to unfeasible returns for some, while proportional investments offer more balanced payback periods but are harder to realise. Overall, current regulatory and pricing frameworks limit the attractiveness of energy communities in practice."

    "abstract": "Von Neumann architecture is the basic computer design model in which a computer has only one memory space for instructions and data. Computer design is therefore streamlined since it allows the sequential process of instructions with efficient execution of programs.The separation of memory and Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Von Neumann architecture poses serious challenges to big data and high-performance computing in terms of high latency and energy consumption resulting from continuous data relocation. In-memory computing (IMC) provides a revolutionary solution to this limitation in that it minimizes data relocation and maximizes computational effectiveness, thus representing an imperative for next-generation high-performance computing solutions. This paper presents a new IMC structure using digital static random access memory (SRAM), which simplifies multiplication and is easily extensible to different bit widths, thus enhancing efficiency. Reusing the existing cells while reducing hardware overhead by employing transmission gates, the design lowers power consumption and delay. Implemented on 45nm technology at an operating voltage of 0.5 V. These optimizations together yielded a reduction of 10.7237% in power consumption and a decrease of 2.2% in delay when compared to the existing design. The design is simple and error-resilient and provides practical advantages for low-power VLSI designs."

    "abstract": "As universal function approximators, Neural Networks (NN) can approximate any function with less than a desired error anywhere within a bounded domain. However, existing studies that train NNs to solve optimization problems based on solver-generated datasets, cannot yet produce predictions with desired accuracy. Motivated by the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT), this paper examines the accuracy of NN prediction in relation to dataset size, problem size, and the construction of training data. Our study shows that a sufficiently large NN can produce accurate predictions when trained with very large datasets, but even so its performance is limited by the quality of the training dataset, which is traditionally obtained by the solution of optimization problems for any given input. A novel data generation approach is proposed for training NN to solve optimization problems, particularly the power flow (PF) problem. The method bypasses the need for solvers to construct datasets by directly utilizing the PF equations. Applications to IEEE test systems show that the proposed approach outperforms solver-based NNs and different optimization algorithms by a wide margin."

Since AODV is efficient and on-demand, it is one of the most widely used protocols. Although AODV performs well in highly mobile environments, it is plagued with frequent route failures and reduced performance. To enhance reliability and performance, this paper proposes a Mobility-Aware Adaptive Fuzzy-based AODV route discovery algorithm (MAF-AODV). In the proposed approach, multiple parameters are evaluated, including node energy, link stability, queue congestion, bandwidth, RSSI, and mobility factors. Compared to traditional AODV and other fuzzy-logic-based algorithms, MAF-AODV improves routing reliability, reduces end-to-end delays, and enhances link connectivity. Using fuzzy decision-making in dynamic MANET environments improves routing adaptive and robustness."

FSO can be used in scenarios where traditional radio frequency communication or fiber optic communication is absurd or expensive. While the FSO system provides many advantages, its communication effectiveness can be impacted by various atmospheric conditions such as scintillation, fog, haze, and rain. This study aims to enhance the efficiency of the FSO module regarding channel capacity. To achieve this goal, the current research employs a hybrid strategy that integrates multiple beam techniques, erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) amplification, and homodyne detection (HD) methods within a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) FSO system. The Gamma-Gamma model is the channel model used in this investigation, and the framework is assessed by utilizing a number of strategies, such as eight beams ($\\mathrm{MB} 8 \\times 8$) with different modulation techniques in the transmitter section. According to the results, using MB8 $\\times 8$ has produced the best performance with a channel capacity of 16 Gbps.

Among several baseline machine learning algorithms, XGBoost and HPT (Hyperparameter tuning), XGBoost is coming out as a dominant performer with a view to performance evaluation. The HPT XGBoost model showed the best accuracy, with 93.2%, and good robustness across metrics such as precision, recall, and ROC-AUC compared to several baseline algorithms such as Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression. Explainability is integrated using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), which provides quantitative feature contributions at both global and individual levels and enhances model predictions' transparency and clinical relevance. This synergy between high-performance machine learning and explainable AI has incredible potential for unlocking actionable insights in healthcare, particularly in the design of interventions for sleep-related disorders such as insomnia and sleep apnea.

Based on a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm optimisation (HMAO) strategy, we present an intelligent cluster-based routing framework for 5G-integrated FANETs. A multicriteria approach is used to select cluster heads and maintain clusters, including residual energy, mobility stability, connectivity, and distance between clusters. The dual-path routing mechanism enhances network reliability and lifetime by combining predictive mobility and load balancing with congestion-aware strategies. According to simulation results, the proposed model reduces energy consumption, breaks fewer links, and improves network lifetime compared to existing RL, Random, and Optimal routing models."

    "abstract": "Model Predictive Thrust Control (MPTC) for Linear Induction Machines (LIMs) has attracted considerable attention in recent years, particularly in its finite and continuous control set formulations. Among these, the finite-control-set MPTC (FCSMPTC) is often favored for its straightforward implementation, relatively fast dynamic response, and ability to handle nonlinear constraints. A notable limitation of FCS-MPTC is its open-loop nature, which can result in thrust tracking errors. Traditionally, an external PI controller is used to form a closed-loop structure and regulate the reference speed. However, the PI-based approach may exhibit slower dynamic response and increased thrust error under varying operating conditions. In this work, Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) is considered as an outer-loop controller in combination with FCS-MPTC. ADRC enhance the system’s ability to handle parameter uncertainties and disturbances. The performance of this integrated control strategy is evaluated using a $3-\\mathrm{kW}$ arc-type LIM model. Simulation results indicate that the FCS-MPTC with ADRC can provide favorable dynamic and steady-state behavior, suggesting potential advantages over the conventional PI-based approach under considered conditions."

The growing share of renewable energy generation and electrification of automotives and home-space heating will significantly alter the supply-demand variations at the different bulk system nodes. It will, therefore, be important to incorporate the nodal variations and their correlations in composite system reliability (CSR) assessment for proper system planning and investment decisions. This paper presents a method to incorporate the nodal correlation of supply and demand in a CSR evaluation and illustrates its application on the Roy Billinton test system (RBTS). Variations in load profiles due to expected growth in electric vehicles and demand due to electric heating systems are modeled to assess their impact on bulk system reliability. The results quantitatively validate the growing need to recognize the correlations in CSR study as the decarbonization of power systems increase with time."

    "abstract": "With the growing adoption of chiplets and 3D ICs in the semiconductor industry, the role of their interconnects has become increasingly crucial to maintain efficient and high-performance communication between chips. Among various interconnect technologies, Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs) are the most prominent, strengthening 3D IC integration and advanced chiplet packaging. In this paper, we propose isosceles trapezoidal-shaped TSVs arranged in an offset mosaic orientation to improve area efficiency for dense nano-scale fabrication. This design achieves over 20% reduction in area consumption compared to conventional cylindrical TSVs for the same number of interconnects. In general, the TSV shape influences stress distribution and thermal management capabilities, and the orientation affects signal transmission, crosstalk, and overall area efficiency. However, the proposed architecture demonstrates outstanding transmission performance and minimal signal interference for multiple TSVs across the 0.01–50 GHz bandwidth, in addition to its remarkable area efficiency. Moreover, the trapezoidal shape is expected to have a better stress distribution and thermal dissipation compared to the triangular design. Collectively, the exploration of the novel TSV shape and pattern marks a significant step toward finding suitable and optimized interconnects for next-generation ICs and advanced chip packaging."

    "abstract": "Residential DC microgrids are experiencing increased adoption due to the global shift towards sustainable energy, which incorporates photovoltaic (PV) systems and battery energy storage systems (BESS) for enhanced efficiency and system reliability. However, the efficient and flexible integration of these resources remains challenging due to variability in voltage levels, load requirements, and power quality standards. A universal power electronic interface (UPEI) is designed to optimize the integration of PV modules and BESS within residential DC microgrids. UPEI architecture employs a multi-port configuration to manage multiple input and output ports, allowing seamless power flow control between PV arrays, batteries, and residential loads. An intelligent control strategy dynamically regulates the power flow, enhances voltage stability, and maximizes energy harvesting from PV sources, ensuring efficient energy utilization across the microgrid. The UPEI also features modular scalability, enabling easy adaptation to different PV and battery capacities. A DC-DC converter topology capable of operating in six different modes has been developed, facilitating versatile and bidirectional power flow control. Moreover, the converter supports bidirectional power flow, allowing energy exchange between the source and the load in both directions. This capability makes it well-suited for integration with renewable energy systems and energy storage units. The simulation results indicate notable improvements in energy efficiency, voltage stability, and o verall system robustness compared to conventional power interfaces. The Universal Power Electronic Interface (UPEI) significantly contributes to the improved performance and reliability of residential DC microgrids, thereby advancing the development of a more sustainable and resilient energy infrastructure."

The system employs IoT gadgets and smart meters to continuously measure energy consumption and support cost optimization and decreased pollution rates. The customary machine learning models and algorithms, though precise, do not give an approximate explanation about predictions. XAI is integrated to make these predictions more understandable rethinking household energy patterns.

Therefore, it is essential to develop solutions that not only ensure the integrity of the FPGA supply chain but also protect FPGAs from potential attacks. While the supply chain is vulnerable at multiple stages, this paper specifically focuses on the stage where the chip’s blueprint—represented as a GDSII file—is transferred from the design house to the foundry. In this proposed research, the traditional method of transferring the design file is transformed by incorporating blockchain technology. Blockchain is used to establish trust and transparency in the supply chain, enabling the tracking and tracing of assets such as IP cores and bitstreams. Moreover, the communication channel is secured against man-in-the-middle attacks, preventing adversaries from intercepting the file. The blockchain network developed for this investigation is simulated using the Ganache user interface provided by the Truffle framework. Simulations were conducted for three different block times—60, 120, and 180 seconds—and the number of blocks mined in each scenario was recorded. Results from the simulations indicate an inverse relationship between block time and the number of blocks mined."

It is argued that artificial intelligence, in particular machine learning and deep neural networks, provide new opportunities for processing and interpreting this data.

Artificial intelligence provides forecasting of resource needs, detection of anomalies in data and suggestion of optimal solutions to reduce costs and increase efficiency. The need to argue attention to data security issues and the ethical aspects of using artificial intelligence in such critical areas is substantiated.

Using the Signal-Mechanism-Consequence underpinning theory as a foundation, the study proposes a conceptual framework to test empirically how agentic AI signals affect financial investors' usage of artificial intelligence in investment decision-making. The research emphasizes the key characteristics of agentic AI for investors' engagement are autonomy, accountability, explainability, fairness, anthropomorphism, and goal-orientedness. An online survey was used to conduct a cross-sectional empirical research, and 305 responses from participants/investors were gathered. The results demonstrate that agentic AI signals of autonomy, accountability, explainability, and goal-orientedness enhanced investor engagement and, consequently, the adoption of AI technology for investment decision-making. Furthermore, anthropomorphism and fairness had no impact on the investors' engagement. These agentic AI characteristics guide the development of agentic AI and highlight the fundamental needs for constructing it for investment decision-making in the financial services industry.

Some of the lossless audio compression are TAK (Tom’s Audio Kompressor), WavPack - Supports hybrid mode (both lossless and lossy), ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec) - Used in Apple devices and FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) - Popular for high-fidelity music storage. Here we have proposed the modified version of the FLAC algorithm that integrates Exponential Golomb coding for enhanced residual encoding. Unlike a direct replication of the standard FLAC pipeline, our approach introduces a novel variant that aims to improve compression efficiency while maintaining audio quality and has been implemented in vivado. In FLAC structure, we can find coding techniques like Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) and Rice encoding. It has been simulated in MATLAB and Vivado. Here we have proposed an FPGA-based implementation of audio compression using Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) and Exponential Golomb coding techniques. The LPC algorithm is employed to analyze and predict the speech signal, generating residuals that are subsequently encoded using Golomb coding for efficient compression. The FPGA synthesis results in vivado shows minimal resource utilization, with LUT, FF, DSP, and I/O consumption recorded at $\\mathbf{0. 4 2 \\%}, \\mathbf{0. 3 9 \\%}, \\mathbf{1 0 \\%}$, and 16.67%, respectively.

This vulnerability arises from the fixed boundaries and limited adaptability of microgrids in dynamic conditions. To address this, a BreadthFirst Search (BFS)-based algorithm is proposed to identify optimal reconfiguration strategies, enabling the transformation of disconnected distribution systems into multiple self-sustained microgrids while minimizing dependence on remote switches. To achieve real-time operation, the solution is embedded in a Deep Reinforcement learning framework that learns adaptive switching policies online. A custom reward function prioritizes supply restoration and minimizes load shedding, while an exponential epsilon-greedy strategy balances exploration and exploitation during training. Simulation results on the IEEE 33bus distribution system show that the proposed method improves convergence speed, decision efficiency, and resilience, outperforming conventional learning models. The framework enables adaptive multi microgrids reconfiguration for enhanced system resilience."

    "abstract": "Pneumonia remains a significant global health concern, posing a substantial threat to human lives due to its contagious nature and potentially fatal respiratory complications caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses. The reliance on chest X-rays for diagnosis, although common, often necessitates expert interpretation, which can lead to delays and potential inaccuracies in treatment. This study addresses these challenges by employing transfer learning techniques to automate the detection of lung diseases, with a focus on pneumonia. Leveraging four pre-trained models: VGG-16, ResNet50V2, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, we conducted comprehensive experiments to evaluate their performance. Our findings reveal that the proposed model, based on VGG-16, demonstrates superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, achieving impressive results: $92.82 \\%$ accuracy, $93.66 \\%$ precision, $92.66 \\%$ recall, and an $F 1$ score of $93.00 \\%$. This research underscores the potential of transfer learning in enhancing pneumonia diagnosis and treatment outcomes, offering a promising avenue for improving healthcare delivery and reducing mortality rates associated with this debilitating respiratory condition."

    "abstract": "Technological progress in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities have transformed the landscape of diagnostic imaging with never before seen accuracy and adaptivity. Nevertheless, lung cancer remains one of the most common causes of cancer deaths; thus, there is a need for strong diagnostic tools to enhance early detection and the subsequent therapy outcome. This study proposes a Multi-Path Deep Lung Cancer Classification Neural Network (MPCNN) that integrates normal and dilated convolutions with residual connections to enhance feature extraction and classification. The network effectively captures multi-scale features, preserves spatial details, and mitigates gradient vanishing, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, the proposed MPCNN achieved ($96.5 \\%$) accuracy, outperforming traditional CNNs ($89.3 \\%$) and vision transformers ($91.8 \\%$). It also demonstrated high precision ($\\mathbf{9 4. 7 \\%}$), recall ($\\mathbf{9 5. 2 \\%}$), and an impressive $\\mathbf{F - 1}$ score $(\\mathbf{9 4. 9 \\%})$. The proposed approach also demonstrated a high Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.982, indicating robust differentiation between normal, benign, and malignant nodules. These results validate MPCNN’s potential for improving lung cancer diagnostics, contributing to early detection and better clinical outcomes."

    "abstract": "Despite decades of investment and regulatory efforts, Africa's Internet ecosystem still relies heavily on infrastructure far outside the continent, routing traffic through Europe and outsourcing critical services like DNS resolution. This dependence on foreign infrastructure exacerbates the impact of subsea cable cuts and exposes a deeper problem. That is, the continent's connectivity fabric remains externally dependent and structurally fragile. Existing measurement tools fail to illuminate this reality, either by missing key components or offering insufficient visibility. We argue for a rethinking of how we monitor and support Africa's Internet infrastructure. Our vision is a purpose-built testbed that combines crowd-sourced vantage points with intentional, context-aware targeting to better capture the unique Internet ecosystem of the continent. Rather than simply retrofitting global solutions, we propose building with the realities of Africa's ecosystem in mind."

    "abstract": "Due to the variability of environmental parameters, Photovoltaic (PV) systems frequently operate under Noisy Operating Conditions (NOC). The existing Flexible Power Point Tracking (FPPT) algorithms encounter significant challenge in misjudging the optimal voltage points under NOC. This paper presents a Frequency Domain-Deep Q-Network (FD-DQN) approach to FPPT by incorporating frequency domain analysis through the Fourier transform, which decomposes irradiance signals to capture dynamic changes caused by noise. Additionally, a novel Signal Quality Factor (SQF) is introduced to quantify noise and refine the learning process, minimizing overfitting in the presence of noisy data. By analyzing the influence of different frequency components, the FD-DQN enables more accurate tracking with fewer misjudgments. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach achieves a minimum improvement of 5% in tracking accuracy and reduces misjudgments by around 50% under NOC, outperforming traditional methods in both simulated and experimental scenarios with fluctuating irradiance."

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer models (RTMs) have emerged as crucial tools for quantifying uncertainties in remote sensing observations. However, most current 3D radiative transfer modeling is based on static scenes, which differ significantly from the dynamic facts of the real world. The UAV shadow and natural wind were also not considered in previous 3D RTM studies. These simplifications in the modeling caused uncertainties in the 3D radiative transfer modeling. To improve the physical realism of 3D radiative transfer modeling, enhancing the model capacity to dynamically simulate the radiative transfer process of forest scenes under physical disturbances in real-time is essential. This study proposed RAPID-RTX, a novel real-time radiative transfer and force field modeling framework for the RAPID model based on Universal Scene Description (USD) and Ray Tracing Xtreme (RTX) rendering technologies. To quantify the effects of UAV shadows and natural wind on UAV-observed forest BRFs, we used RAPID-RTX to simulate forest scenes with and without UAV shadows under multiple viewing angles, and to assess the impact of wind-induced tree movement. Results showed that UAV shadows significantly impact forest BRF, especially at viewing directions near hotspot direction. In the simple plantation scene, the maximum impact reached 83.9% in the red band and 73.7% in the NIR band, whereas in the dense forest scene (Wytham Woods 2015), the maximum impact reached 51.5% and 40.6% in the red and NIR bands, respectively. To minimize the impact of UAV shadows on UAV observed forest BRF, it is recommended that the sensor FOV is larger than 5° and the flight height is higher than 60 meters. Additionally, at wind speed levels 3 and 5 (4 m/s and 10 m/s), the maximum wind impact on forest BRFs in the red band reaches 23.8% and 28.5%, respectively, while in the NIR band the corresponding values are 26.1% and 33.3%. Therefore, we recommend avoiding remote sensing experiments when the wind speed exceeding 4 m/s."

By exploiting programmable threshold voltages of CTF devices, the switching voltage of each inverter can be precisely controlled, enabling a quantization scheme with only two transistors per level. Through a fine-tuning process with soft-erase operations, the switching voltages of 13 inverters were evenly mapped with 0.1 V spacing. The fabricated ADC achieved the maximum DNL and INL of 0.11 LSB and 0.14 LSB, respectively.

    "abstract": "We propose and experimentally demonstrate a 16-channel DFB laser array operating in the C-band, featuring high output power, narrow linewidth, low relatice intensity noise (RIN) and uniform wavelength spacing. The reconstruction equivalent chirp (REC) technique is used to introduce equivalent π phase shifts, simplify the grating process, and enhance the wavelength control accuracy. To maximize output efficiency, high-reflection (HR) and anti-reflection (AR) coatings are deposited on the rear and front facets, respectively. In addition, an asymmetric equivalent phase-shift configuration is incorporated into the cavity, which enhances the single-mode yield of the lasers and improves the precision of the wavelength spacing. A passive waveguide with light <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>-type doping was introduced to suppress the overlap between the optical mode and both the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i>-type cladding and the active region, thereby reducing carrier-induced absorption losses and significantly improving the slope efficiency of the laser. As a result, the proposed 16-channel DFB laser array operates with a channel spacing of 200 GHz and a maximum wavelength deviation of only 0.01 nm. Each laser delivers an output power exceeding 300 mW at a bias current of 1000 mA and 25 °C. The intrinsic Lorentzian linewidth is as narrow as 64 kHz, while the relative intensity noise (RIN) remains below −160 dB/Hz for bias currents above 500 mA. These results highlight the array’s strong potential for applications in optical I/O technology, free-space optical (FSO) communication, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems."

    "abstract": "An integrated sensing and communication network can be implemented with the widely laid submarine communication cables using the distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) technology, providing the capabilities of sensing acoustic signals around the cables. However, the seabed activities, ocean currents, and vessel anchor drag usually cause the position shift of cables, affecting the cable maintenance. Moreover, the precise localization of acoustic sources, including ocean seismic, marine mammals, and ship movement, also requires the accurate cable locations. Conventional methods for repositioning submarine cables, which rely on sonar and profiler technologies, often necessitate specialized vessels and equipment. Such approaches incur high operational costs and difficulties in achieving frequent cable positioning. To address this issue, this article first analyzes the ship wave pattern in DAS data, identifying the vertices of V-shaped ship wave as reliable indicators of ship movement, and thus further proposes a cost-effective repositioning method that collaboratively integrates DAS-recorded ship wave patterns and ships' Automatic Identification System (AIS) information to accurately determine the longitude and latitude of ship travelling above the cables, allowing for the deduction of the cable route. This study conducted a field test on a newly laid 1.7-kilometer submarine communication cable near Gulangyu Island, Xiamen. The experimental results demonstrate that the calculated longitude and latitude of the cable's endpoints exhibit high consistency with those specified in the construction drawings, with discrepancies of only 14.36 meters and 30.28 meters, respectively. This proposed method is applicable to the calibration of buried submarine communication cables."

    "abstract": "All-day surface downwelling longwave radiation (SDLR) is essential for studying surface radiation balance and the greenhouse effect. However, estimating SDLR under cloudy-sky conditions poses significant challenges due to the reliance on accurate cloud parameters acquisition. Most existing satellite-based algorithms for cloudy-sky SDLR retrieval are limited to daytime operations, as passive satellites are unable to provide critical data, such as cloud optical thickness, during night-time data that are crucial for estimating cloud base parameters. This study introduces an all-day SDLR retrieval algorithm based on cloud top temperature (CTT) and constructs a cloud impact factor based on cloud top height to regulate the radiative forcing contribution of clouds. The newly established algorithm was validated using ground-based measurements from Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) sites. Compared to algorithms that directly utilize CTT, the new approach incorporating the cloud impact factor demonstrated higher accuracy, with a bias of ﹣1.32 W/m<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> and an RMSE of 17.75 W/m<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>. Subsequently, datasets from the FengYun-4A (FY-4A) geostationary satellite were employed to retrieve all-day cloudy-sky SDLR with hourly resolution.

Considering optimal power flow interactions resulting from the unstable voltage relationship among energy storage system-photovoltaic (ESS-PV) inverters, a steady state voltage security area (SSVSA) is established for these inverters. To assess the voltage security margin between the operational state and the security boundary, a voltage excursion indicator is proposed for processing optimal power flow within the local area. The proposed approach enables a fully guaranteed convergence and optimized power flow within a decentralized distributed energy management framework, systematically via multi-block ADMM handling of large-scale and distributed data via energy internet. This approach guaranteed convergence of optimal power flow via local consensus control by distributed ESS-PV systems with energy internet via all-to-all communication between centralized energy managers and inverters. Simulation results show the effectiveness of proposed approach."

In some ALOS-4 images, azimuth fractional ambiguity caused by the VPRI is observed, and it differs from the usual integer ambiguity resulting from inter-channel errors in that it occurs at smaller intervals. In this paper, we propose a sequential Doppler offset (SDO) method for locating the original target (OT) that causes azimuth fractional ambiguity. First, the ratio of the interval of integer ambiguity to that of fractional ambiguity is obtained, which is used to generate SAR images with different Doppler center frequencies. Second, the coherence between the sum image of the generated images and the image with a zero Doppler center frequency is calculated. Third, some points with coherence greater than a threshold are selected based on the coherence. Finally, the final OT is obtained by detecting the filtered selected points. Some experiments are conducted based on ALOS-4 L1.2 data, and the results demonstrate that the method locates the OT accurately. In short, the proposed method provides a starting point for fractional ambiguity suppression in HRWS-SAR."

To bridge this gap, we propose DFD-Stereo, a lightweight and efficient stereo matching framework that delivers high-quality disparity estimation with reduced computational cost. The framework incorporates two key components: (1) a Decoupled Frequency-Spatial Learning (DFSL) module, which enables complementary spatial-frequency representation for enhanced global context modeling, and (2) a Stepwise Coupling Disparity Refinement (SCDR) module, which leverages multi-scale RGB-disparity fusion with Shuffle Attention to refine disparity predictions effectively.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a novel spectral-efficient design for a multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system assisted by Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) within the emerging Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) framework. The proposed system leverages uplink Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) and RIS-enhanced multi-UAV collaboration to jointly serve mobile users and perform target sensing. A hierarchical double-timescale solution is introduced, combining an adaptive Affinity Propagation Clustering (APC) approach for long-term UAV deployment and user-target association, with a short-term iterative algorithm for optimizing user transmit power, UAV beamforming, and RIS phase shifts. To tackle the non-convex optimization problem, a solution is proposed, leveraging Lagrangian dual transform, fractional programming, and minorization methods. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating significant improvements in both communication data rates and sensing information rates compared to existing benchmarks."

    "abstract": "In this letter, we investigate whether classical function allocation—the principle of assigning tasks to either a human or a machine—holds for physical Human-Robot Collaboration, which is important for providing insights for Industry 5.0 to guide how to best augment rather than replace workers. This study empirically tests the applicability of Fitts' List within physical Human-Robot Collaboration, by conducting a user study (N=26, within-subject design) to evaluate four distinct allocations of position/force control between human and robot in an abstract blending task. We hypothesize that the function in which humans control the position achieves better performance and receives higher user ratings. When allocating position control to the human and force control to the robot, compared to the opposite case, we observed a significant improvement in preventing overblending. This was also perceived better in terms of physical demand and overall system acceptance, while participants experienced greater autonomy, more engagement and less frustration. An interesting insight was that the supervisory role (when the robot controls both position and force) was rated second best in terms of subjective acceptance. Another surprising insight was that if position control was delegated to the robot, the participants perceived much lower autonomy than when the force control was delegated to the robot. These findings empirically support applying Fitts' principles to static function allocation for physical collaboration, while also revealing important nuanced user experience trade-offs, particularly regarding perceived autonomy when delegating position control."

    "abstract": "Terahertz communication is a pivotal candidate technology for future 6G networks. Deep learning (DL)-based transmission methods can utilize the real-time data to model channel statistics and device imperfections, presenting an effective manner to solve the modeling problems of non-ideality and channel in the terahertz band. However, there still exist several shortages hindering the development of DL-based terahertz communications, that is high system complexity, costly online retraining to fit changing non-ideality and channel conditions, and learned diagrams with high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). This paper proposes novel methods to address the above challenges. At first, a new regulated autoencoder (RAE) structure is proposed to fit changing conditions without online retraining. Secondly, a binary neural network (BNN) method is leveraged to reduce the receiver complexity and a lookup table based method to cut down the transmitter complexity. Lastly, a new maximum normalization method is proposed to reduce PAPR of the learned diagram. Extensive simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods."

    "abstract": "Healthcare organizations face increasing pressure to improve quality outcomes while managing limited resources effectively. While the National Association for Healthcare Quality (NAHQ) has developed a framework for healthcare quality competencies, the relationships between these competencies and organizational performance remain unclear. This study investigates how different quality competencies collectively and individually influence healthcare organizational performance through the lens of stakeholder theory. We integrate the NAHQ competency framework with the Baldrige Excellence Framework to develop and test a theoretical model linking quality competencies to organizational outcomes. Survey data from 152 healthcare professionals in the United States were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Contrary to conventional expectations, the results show that neither quality leadership nor health data analytics directly improves organizational outcomes. Instead, their enabling effects work through a set of legitimacy-oriented competencies as essential mediators. Specifically, the findings reveal that the competency of quality leadership and integration significantly influences both health data analytics and legitimacy-oriented competencies. While health data analytics shows no direct effect on quality results, it significantly enhances legitimacy-oriented competencies, which in turn strongly influence quality outcomes. A series of robustness checks, including bias assessments for the survey method, construct reliability and validity checks, and control variable analysis based on healthcare professional experience levels, were conducted to validate the results. The findings suggest that healthcare organizations should focus on developing integrated quality capabilities rather than pursuing isolated improvements, as the impact of both leadership and analytics capabilities on organizational performance is primarily mediated through other operational competencies. This research contributes to healthcare quality management theory and provides practical guidance for healthcare leaders on effectively allocating resources across different competency domains."

    "abstract": "Ultrafast nonlinear dynamics in optical fibers as the cornerstone of ultrashort laser pulse transmission and control is significant for the rapid development of mode-locked fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers, and fiber communication technologies. Solving the nonlinear Schrödinger equation using traditional numerical methods is very time-consuming, which greatly limits the design of experiments and real-time optimization. Deep learning technology has been introduced to predict ultrafast nonlinear dynamics in optical fibers and has achieved significant breakthroughs. However, existing deep learning-based methods mainly focus on the effective prediction of single scenarios. Moreover, the prediction accuracy of deep learning-based methods for ultrafast nonlinear dynamics in optical fibers needs to be further improved. In this study, a conditional Fourier neural operator (FNO) is proposed to predict the ultrafast nonlinear dynamics of multiple typical propagation scenarios in optical fibers accurately. A total of six independent tasks are completed by a single model of conditional FNO. The results show that the conditional FNO can predict the ultrafast nonlinear dynamics of different input pulses propagating under different fiber parameter settings with extremely high accuracy and strong generalization ability. In terms of accuracy metrics, the conditional FNO achieves state-of-the-art results. Strong generalization ability is the inherent advantage of neural operators. Our work provides an advanced and powerful generalized model for predicting ultrafast nonlinear dynamics, offering important insights into the widespread applications of deep learning in ultrafast optics."

The proposed analytical formulation of the outage probability considers a realistic stochastic model for beam misalignment in the azimuth plane induced by platform instabilities under Rician fading channel conditions while using uniform linear array (ULA) antenna for transmit-receive beamforming. Importantly, we model the following misalignment cases resembling instabilities of various NTN UAV platforms: 1) misalignment varying at a rate faster than the channel fading and symbol duration, and 2) misalignment varying at a rate similar to or slower than the channel fading and symbol duration. Using the proposed analytical model, we show that a higher antenna order will not always result in performance gain in the presence of misalignment due to UAV platform instabilities. Specifically, when misalignment varies faster than the channel fading and symbol duration, achievable performance gain saturates beyond an antenna order of 16, irrespective of misalignment severity. Whereas, when misalignment varies at a rate similar to or slower than the channel fading and symbol duration, severe misalignment significantly degrades performance for antenna orders exceeding 8. These findings emphasize the importance of dynamic antenna array selection to optimize performance in NTNs."

    "abstract": "As the core power source of new energy vehicles, the state-of-health (SOH) of lithium-ion batteries is directly related to the life and safety of vehicles. However, batteries have the characteristics of complex data structure, long cycle period, and high noise information, which leads to bottlenecks in the accuracy and robustness of existing SOH prediction methods. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-stage heterogeneous decoupled network (MHD-Net) to improve the prediction performance of SOH. First, considering the complex data of SOH, this paper proposes a dynamic channel aware block (DCAB), which uses the “divide and conquer” idea and combines the dynamic gating mechanism to enhance the relationship perception ability between feature channels; secondly, a heterogeneous fusion network (HFN) is designed in the backbone part, which fully extracts deep information from longer sequences by constructing multi-granular feature subsequences and adopting a progressive fusion strategy; finally, an adaptive decoupled prediction head (ADPH) is proposed, which can highlight periodic features and suppress noise information in the frequency domain, thereby improving the prediction accuracy. To evaluate the performance of MHD-Net, we use NASA and CALCE datasets for experiments. The minimum errors of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE for the two datasets are 0.48%, 0.38%, 0.47%, and 1.06%, 0.69%, and 1.10%, respectively. The results show that MHD-Net outperforms other network models in terms of prediction accuracy and reliability."

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is a promising technology for enhancing the performance of next-generation wireless systems. RIS operation requires accurate channel state information, which induces excessive pilot overhead due to the large number of RIS elements. To address this challenge, researchers propose blind beamforming algorithms that use Received Signal Reference Power (RSRP) obtained with various RIS configurations to determine the optimal RIS configuration. Most existing RSRP-based RIS adjustment algorithms assume quasi-static channels and are inefficient in time-varying and rich-scattering channels. This letter introduces blind beamforming algorithm called RISA, which is designed for time-varying channels. RISA adapts its parameters in real time using a Simulated Annealing approach to match the current channel state. We analyze the impact of RISA’s parameters and demonstrate its significant performance gains across mobility scenarios with high multipath fading. The obtained results show that RISA improves SNR up to 6 dB over state-of-the-art methods, even in low-SNR regimes. Also, we demonstrate its flexibility by applying it to the coverage enhancement problem of maximizing the minimum SNR."

    "abstract": "Heating electrification with heat pumps is a key decarbonization strategy; however, its implementation in cold climates presents challenges to grid capacity. This paper presents a machine learning-driven framework to model neighbourhoodlevel heating demand using synthetic residential energy datasets, enabling scenario-based analysis for 2035 and 2050. We tested six machine learning models to estimate heating demand: linear regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Regression, and k -Nearest Neighbours. The Random Forest model, trained on a comprehensive feature set including temperature differential, building attributes, and HVAC characteristics, delivered the best predictive performance in terms of MAE and MSE. This model was used to simulate household-level demand and scale results to the neighbourhood level. Results indicate that replacing fuel-based heating with heat pumps reduces CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> emissions by $25 \\%$ to $73 \\%$, although peak demand constraints remain critical, particularly in scenarios with electric backup heating. Cold-climate heat pumps reduce peak backup heating demand by only $5 \\%$, while fuel-based backup heating peaks at $43 \\%$ of the electric backup scenario, highlighting a trade-off between emissions reductions and peak demand. These findings underscore the importance of aligning electrification policies with grid decarbonization trajectories and implementing demand-side strategies, such as thermostat preheating, to mitigate peak loads. The proposed work provides a configuration-driven approach for potentially integrating detailed household-level heating models into broader planning efforts."

    "abstract": "The path planning of autonomous vehicle needs to take into account the adaptability of complex environment and real-time. This study proposes path planning strategies that integrate traditional methods and intelligent algorithms for both unstructured and structured road scenarios. In unstructured roads, a bidirectional artificial potential field method combined with a fifth order Bezier curve is constructed to improve the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm framework. By using bidirectional gravitational synergy to avoid local minima, high-order curve fitting and intelligent optimization are utilized to enhance path smoothness; Structured roads adopt a hierarchical planning architecture, with the global layer generating topological paths using a hybrid A* algorithm, and the local layer achieving dynamic obstacle avoidance through Frenet coordinate system and improved deep reinforcement learning (SQDQN). The algorithm has been validated for effectiveness in simulation and real vehicle testing, with a 9.5% reduction in path length and a 75% reduction in curvature fluctuation in unstructured scenarios; The decision delay in structured scenarios has been reduced from 180ms to 102ms, and the obstacle avoidance success rate has been increased to 97.6%. By utilizing CUDA parallel computing and model lightweight design, the algorithm is ensured to meet real-time requirements on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier platform. The research results provide theoretical support and technical solutions for the full scenario path planning of autonomous driving. In the future, we will further explore multimodal information fusion and multi-agent collaborative optimization to enhance the algorithm's generalization ability in complex traffic environments."

Even though traditional methods work, they are often limited by the resources that are available and the physical demands they put on both patients and providers. Wearable robots have come up as a potential way to get around these problems. It offers new ways to speed up healing through personalized and automatic treatment. This essay looks at how wearing robots can be used to help people who have had a stroke recover their movement skills. It talks about both the problems that exist and the chances that could come up. Exoskeletons and soft robotic suits are examples of wearable robots that can help patients in ways that are perfectly tailored to their needs. Not only do these devices support muscles that aren't working as well, but they also help the brain change by requiring repeated movement practice, which is important for healing. Many problems keep them from being widely used, even though they have many benefits. Technical problems like the need for a lot of customization, the longevity of sensors and motors, and the ease of use of interfaces are big problems. Potential home-based recovery methods could cut down on healthcare costs by a lot and make life better for people who have had a stroke. Wearable robots could completely change the way stroke therapy is done, making it faster, easier to get to, and more tailored to each person's needs. This could be done by solving the problems listed and bringing together experts from different fields."

The model finds prediction from three deep learning algorithms, and we compare their predictions and find that the ResNet101 model performed best. The nail disease dataset downloaded from Kaggle repository consists of classified image data divided into a training (80%) and a test (20%) set. The model extracts patterns from these images to detect 17 classes of nail diseases. The best model, ResNet101, got an accuracy of 99.94%, F1 score of 99.94%, precision of 99.94%, and recall of 99.94%. This model thus outperforms the individual models and traditional techniques. The performance was evaluated by observing the model performance. In the table below, the displayed accuracy numbers confirm the categorization of nail conditions, thus proving its utility. The recognition accuracy of models against each state of nails is provided in the tabular representation. These findings present evidence of the versatility of our proposed approach, which can deal with several nail-related problems having diverse characteristics.

To conduct the study a mixed methodology was applied, including literature review, comparative regulatory analysis, and an expert interview with an information security manager. Findings show that the NIS2 Directive introduces stricter requirements for cybersecurity, governance, and incident reporting across the EU. The study confirms the hypothesis that banking sector experiences fewer obstacles for NIS2 implementation because of alignment to the prior legislation frameworks in which the requirements overlap in comparison to NIS2 (e.g., DORA, GDPR, and PSD2). In addition, analysis points out that the fragmented transposition across EU member states generates compliance inconsistencies, operational inefficiencies, and resource constraints. Key obstacles include divergent reporting requirements, lack of harmonization with national laws (e.g., Latvia's National Cybersecurity Law), et al. To ensure effective and efficient compliance with NIS2 Directive few of the recommendations are establishing centralized oversight mechanism across the EU, enhancing bank and regulators collaboration within the process of national legislation development, and promoting industry-wide best practice sharing."

We hypothesize that an explainable hybrid IDS-running a signature engine in parallel with an ML-based anomaly detector, fusing alerts, and attaching operator-oriented explanations via explainable AI (XAI; e.g., SHAP values)-can improve operational usefulness. We outline a lightweight taxonomy, a reference pipeline, a qualitative gap matrix, and a concise evaluation plan designed to be testable on public ICS datasets. This positions a practical path toward higher coverage with actionable, human-centered alerts."

    "abstract": "Depression is a common mental disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Psychological assessments remain the most commonly used diagnostic tools. However, this reliance highlights the opportunity to explore alternative approaches based on the use of machine learning models. This study explores a multimodal graph-based machine learning approach that combines electroencephalography (EEG), voice signals, demographic information, and psychological test results to detect depression. Two sets of graphs were generated using different combinations of features. The graph2vec model was then employed to generate embeddings for each graph set. Seven machine learning algorithms were trained using the embeddings as feature vectors. The results demonstrate competitive performance compared to those reported in the literature, achieving F1-scores above 0.95 while relying on less complex methods. The methodology employed and the results obtained are promising, highlighting the potential of graph-based approaches for performing multimodal classification tasks. However, there are limitations mainly related to associated with computational resources that should be analyzed in greater detail."

    "abstract": "In the era of information technology, the concerns related to cybersecurity regarding the transmission of large volumes of data are of utmost priority. In this aspect, the necessity of a strong and more secure encryption-decryption algorithm would play a dominant role. For developing various types of encryption-decryption algorithms, which could be based on the key type, like symmetric and asymmetric, or their functionality, like block ciphers, or based on their mathematical foundations, like ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) - based algorithms, the utility of a recurrence relation in developing an algorithm has proved to be extremely beneficial. Fibonacci sequence, Lucas sequence and Pell's sequence are some of the standard sequences that are defined by the recurrence relation, and several of their cryptographic applications have been proved to be computationally very efficient in terms of security and time complexity. In this paper, we do a review on the possible cryptographic applications, that can be developed based on the p - Tribonacci numbers which are a generalized form of Tribonacci numbers and its associated Q- type matrix, for enhancing the encryption algorithms which involves ECC and the matrix, for a fixed value of p, also how we can enhance the encryption algorithm for digital image security, particularly under the hyperchaotic system, to calibrate security and time complexity."

    "abstract": "Main memory is a critical component for storing computational data across various applications, including highly sensitive information such as banking transactions, encryption keys, and authentication credentials. However, memory systems are susceptible to side-channel attacks, making it imperative to implement effective countermeasures against unauthorized data extraction. Additionally, counterfeit memory controllers and memory devices pose a significant security risk, as they can facilitate data leakage even in the presence of conventional encryption mechanisms. Traditional security solutions, such as AES encryption integrated into memory controllers, provide strong cryptographic protection; however, they introduce substantial latency and area overhead. This paper presents a novel security countermeasure that ensures secure communication between the memory controller and the memory device by employing XOR-based encryption and decryption at both ends. The proposed technique remains secure even in the presence of unauthenticated memory components, preventing unauthorized data access. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a high level of security (2<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">512</sup>) while significantly reducing area overhead and incurring no additional access latency."

This study proposes a 5G based hierarchical collaborative architecture and algorithm optimization scheme to address the issues of insufficient collaborative efficiency, delayed real-time response, and complex heterogeneous resource scheduling in distributed systems in smart cities. The aim is to build an efficient and reliable urban intelligent management system. A distributed topology recognition algorithm has been developed, which utilizes static configuration and dynamic signaling diffusion mechanism to achieve real-time perception and update of urban infrastructure topology. The topology update delay is controlled within 50ms, and signaling overhead is reduced by 89%. Propose a cross layer collaborative resource scheduling algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning and edge caching technology, increasing system resource utilization by 38% and reducing emergency business bandwidth allocation latency to 19ms. Construct a three-level collaborative decision-making architecture of \"end edge cloud\", with edge node inference latency stable within 22ms and cloud model prediction error controlled at 3.2%, achieving an organic combination of local rapid response and global optimization. Experimental verification shows that this architecture is significantly better than traditional solutions in both simulation and field environments, with a 20.5% reduction in overall network energy consumption and a 63% increase in edge computing power utilization. It provides efficient solutions for scenarios such as vehicle road collaboration and smart energy. The research results have deepened the integration theory of 5G technology and smart cities, broken through the performance bottleneck of traditional centralized architecture, and provided a technical paradigm for the large-scale deployment of city level real-time systems. Future research will focus on optimizing robustness in extreme scenarios, privacy protection technologies for cross departmental data collaboration, and improving green communication energy efficiency, promoting the evolution of smart cities towards greater resilience and sustainability."

By leveraging existing custom instructions and hardware kernels originally developed for LLaMA v2 models, Flan-T5 inference was successfully achieved on IMAX3 without requiring any modification to the hardware instruction set or the high level inference workflow.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of Flan-T5 on a CGLA based accelerator.

    "abstract": "Modern ML workloads increasingly rely on direct communication between host devices—such as GPUs, NVMe SSDs, and DRAM—spanning intra-host and inter-host networks. However, today's intra-host network lacks hardware-level primitives for routing across heterogeneous interconnects, hindering efficient use of alternative paths and leading to sub-optimal performance under failures or congestion. Furthermore, the inter-host network treats the NIC as the endpoint, with intra-host interconnects like PCIe running oblivious to inter-host network protocols. This prevents leveraging multiple paths for communication between host devices across different servers. To address these limitations, we propose expanding the datacenter network layer to encompass the intra-host network, making intra-host devices first-class network endpoints. Our scheme envisions hardware-level routing and forwarding across multiple intra-host interconnects and makes intra-host devices visible to the inter-host network. This unified approach provides a principled foundation for robust, efficient peer-to-peer communication between storage and compute hardware devices in AI datacenters."

Previous solutions have made progress in explicitly modeling the dynamic obstacle motion for avoidance, but this key dependency of decision-making is time-consuming and unreliable in highly dynamic scenarios with occlusions. On the contrary, without introducing object detection, tracking, and prediction, we empower the reinforcement learning (RL) with single LiDAR sensing to realize an autonomous flight system directly from point to motion. For exteroception, a depth sensing <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">distance map</i> achieving fixed-shape, low-resolution, and detail-safe is encoded from raw point clouds, and an environment change sensing <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">point flow</i> is adopted as motion features extracted from multi-frame observations. These two are integrated into a lightweight and easy-to-learn representation of complex dynamic environments. For action generation, the behavior of avoiding dynamic threats in advance is implicitly driven by the proposed change-aware sensing representation, where the policy optimization is indicated by the relative motion modulated distance field. With the deployment-friendly sensing simulation and dynamics model-free acceleration control, the proposed system shows a superior success rate and adaptability to alternatives, and the policy derived from the simulator can drive a real-world quadrotor with safe maneuvers."

    "abstract": "Machine vision in automatic obstacle avoidance systems must be capable of precisely detecting circumstances, which necessitates the use of photodetectors with multi-signal reception capabilities, high sensitivity, and rapid reaction. However, the current method uses avalanche diodes or liars, which have a limited response wavelength range and high consumption, making it difficult to deal with complicated situations.

    "abstract": "In various pedestrian motion scenarios, data-driven pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) methods have demonstrated strong localization performance, significantly enhancing system adaptability and robustness. However, most existing deep learning models have high computational costs. This makes them difficult to deploy on energy-constrained mobile devices for long-term use. Current lightweight PDR networks adopt a single-input-single-output structure. Although effective in complex dynamics, this design becomes redundant in low-dynamic conditions such as static or slow walking. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight network architecture named Motion-aware Early-exit Inertial Odometry Network (MEIO-Net). The model adopts a multi-exit design and incorporates a dedicated training scheme. Displacement covariance is used to assess motion difficulty. An early exit mechanism is then introduced to adaptively adjust the inference depth based on dynamic complexity. With a slight improvement in accuracy, MEIO-Net significantly reduces computational cost across multiple datasets. In the self-collected data set, it achieves a 48.9% reduction in FLOPs compared to state-of-the-art lightweight models. In typical simple pedestrian motion scenarios, the computational cost of the proposed model is reduced by 50.5%–80.5%. Ablation studies further confirm that MEIO-Net can flexibly terminate inference according to the intensity of the pedestrian motion. These results demonstrate its strong generalizability and practical potential for real-world deployment. Code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/SunXuehang/MEIO-Net.git."

    "abstract": "Bio-Radar (BR) systems measure physiological activity by using the micro-Doppler effect to detect signal reflections from the human body. The quality of the received signal is influenced by several factors, most notably the Radar Cross Section (RCS) of the subject, which becomes especially complex in close-proximity conditions. To optimize BR system performance, this paper investigates the radio channel propagation in short-range conditions, focusing on RCS variations at close distances. The study was conducted using a Continuous-Wave (CW) radar system operating at 5.8 GHz, with measurements taken in an anechoic chamber. Ten human subjects with varying characteristics were analyzed. The findings demonstrate that RCS fluctuates with distance, exhibiting oscillatory behavior at short-range distances, with values ranging between −45 dBsm and −20 dBsm. They also reveal a correlation between RCS measurements and the extraction of vital signs, identifying specific conditions under which vital sign detection is significantly compromised. Additionally, the data indicate that male subjects tend to have higher RCS values than female subjects."

    "abstract": "Pansharpening is a vital process that aims to obtain high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images by fusing panchromatic (PAN) and low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) images. With the advancement of deep learning (DL), data-driven pansharpening methods have been developed extensively, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional approaches. However, most current DL-based studies still struggle to effectively preserve spectral properties and adequately capture spatial details, and fail to comprehensively integrate complementary information across modalities, leading to suboptimal results. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative cross-modal information aggregation network (CMIAN) with feature enhancement for pansharpening. The CMIAN comprises three core components: a feature enhancement (FE) module that enhances feature representation of both modalities through a simplify-and-enhance approach, a cross-modal feature aggregation (CMFA) module that aggregates intra-modal features based on the characteristic differences between MS and PAN images, and a cross-modal information reconstruction (CMIR) module that adaptively balances large-scale features and local details of PAN images, and performs image reconstruction to yield desirable pansharpening outcomes. Experiments on the QuickBird, WorldView-2, and WorldView-3 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed CMIAN. On the WorldView-3 dataset, for instance, our CMIAN outperforms the second-best method by 5.95% in MPSNR and 9.41% in SAM."

    "abstract": "Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) , as a sensor for mapping and localizing subsurface features, has gained significant attention in robotic localization for complex environments. However, varying weather conditions change the subsurface dielectric constant, which weakens the registration correlation between real-time images and maps, thereby compromising localization stability. We design an image registration framework for localizing ground penetrating radar (LGPR) in multi-weather. Specifically, we first propose an adaptive hyperbolic receptive field that aims to significantly enhance the robust features in the GPR images, while improving both discrimination capability in map and reliability for image registration. Then, an image alignment module is introduced to eliminate the time-delay blurring problem caused by the variation of dielectric constant under multi-weather conditions. The proposed method was evaluated on three distinct datasets (simulated, publicly available, and self-constructed), demonstrating significant improvements in registration and localization performance. The average correlation coefficient on simulated data achieved a enhancement from 0.3796 to 0.7406 compared with baseline, validating the effectiveness of feature enhancement. Furthermore, measured datasets exhibited 15% higher average registration and localization accuracy than baseline. These results demonstrate that the method provides a reliable guarantee for the stable operation of LGPR systems in complex environments. The datasets will be released at: https://github.com/Eazin-bz/dataset_AHFT.git."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential for autonomous navigation within internet of things (IoT) environments, where various and changing uncertainties pose significant challenges for safe, real-world deployment. Existing safe RL methods typically employ heuristic constraints while neglecting the combined impact of multiple uncertainty sources, reducing robustness and interpretability. Drawing on concepts from global navigation satellite system (GNSS) integrity monitoring, this paper proposes an epistemic integrity risk monitoring reinforcement learning (EIRM-RL) framework to enable trustworthy autonomous navigation under uncertainty. EIRM-RL extends the GNSS protection level concept to RL by utilizing an assembled world model that quantifies and incorporates sensor noise, systematic bias, and epistemic uncertainty. Furthermore, the framework continuously monitors a dynamic epistemic risk probability, which is incorporated into policy optimization as an adaptive safety constraint via Lagrangian duality. This method enables the agent to proactively avoid hazards and effectively balance safety and performance, even in highly uncertain environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EIRM-RL achieves superior success rates, collision avoidance, and robustness compared to state-of-the-art safe RL methods, while maintaining high efficiency."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an analytical and experimental investigation of the magnetic field distribution in the air gap of a single-stator, single-rotor axial flux permanent magnet (AFPM) machine under no-load conditions. To simplify the problem, the model is rectified using quasi-3D modeling techniques at the machine’s mean radius. A quasi-static analytical Fourier based formulation is developed to describe the magnetic field produced by a classical North-South permanent magnet array. In addition, the influence of stator slotting on the air-gap field waveform is assessed through the Schwarz–Christoffel conformal transformation, enabling an accurate representation of slot-induced distortions. The resulting methodology provides a clear analytical framework for evaluating and quantifying harmonic distortion in the field distribution due to geometric discontinuities. To validate the model, experimental measurements are performed using a custom-designed four-degree-of-freedom scanning test bench equipped with a three-axial Hall-effect sensor capable of capturing detailed field profiles across the air gap. The comparison between analytical results, finite element method (FEM) simulations and experimental results demonstrates good agreement, confirming the reliability of the proposed approach for AFPM machines."

    "abstract": "High-performance natural scene image transmission via multimode fiber (MMF) represents a substantial challenge. Conventional MMF gray imaging system relies on the visual persistence phenomenon of the digital micromirror device (DMD), causing redundant capture time and loss of bit-depth information. We introduce bit-plane encoding to extract eight speckles from gray targets at different bit-planes, thereby constructing a speckle cube to enrich the captured information. Our self-designed HySpeckNet model enhances the connections among high-dimensional features within speckle cubes. As a result, the average structural similarity index (SSIM) on the ImageNet dataset improves from 0.586 to 0.617, representing a 5.3% increase compared to traditional methods. Notably, gray image reconstruction can be approximately achieved using only two high-order speckles, resulting in a transmission speed about 11.76 times faster than traditional gray image restoration method. Our research sets the stage for the practical transmission of complex image information via MMFs."

    "abstract": "The rise of the low-altitude network (LAN) has driven the demand for situational awareness in dynamic environments, where integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) serves as a key enabler. To meet these requirements, ISAC systems increasingly employ high-frequency carriers and large-scale antenna arrays, thereby making near-field propagation effects non-negligible. However, existing studies have primarily focused on static near-field targets, which limits their applicability in dynamic LANs. In response to this limitation, we investigate a near-field ISAC system in which a ground-based ISAC transceiver simultaneously communicates with multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and exploits their signal echoes for joint sensing. Specifically, we aim to estimate the angle of arrival (AoA), distance, and velocity of each UAV to support mobility-aware operations. Given the substantial number of parameters to be estimated, conventional methods such as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or matched filtering incur prohibitive computational costs. To address this issue, we propose Res-UNet-GRU, a neural network that integrates a residual UNet (Res-UNet) with a gated recurrent unit (GRU) to facilitate the aggregate estimation of location and motion parameters. The proposed network can estimate the UAV state without requiring exhaustive search or complex optimization, making it well-suited for high-mobility LANs and providing a foundational perception layer for future artificial general intelligence (AGI)-driven autonomous systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed Res-UNet-GRU consistently achieves the lowest mean squared error (MSE) in estimating AoA, distance, and velocity parameters across all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels compared to benchmark deep learning (DL)-based estimators."

    "abstract": "Marine reciprocating compressor packages are critical in offshore oil and gas production but face inherent challenges for process monitoring due to explosion-proof requirements and limited onboard sensing. Many key process variables, such as flow rates and stage-wise efficiencies, remain unmeasured in practice, hindering comprehensive and accurate real-time monitoring. This study proposes a digital twin-based virtual sensing approach that integrates process mechanism modeling with real-time data streams to infer unmeasured variables from limited measurements and reconstruct package-level operating states. A full package-level process mechanism model was established in HYSYS, incorporating compression, heat exchange, and recycle control modules, and further generalized through a cascaded-stage modeling strategy that supports scalable deployment across packages with different configurations. A DT framework was constructed to couple the model with real-time sensor inputs, enabling continuous model updating, virtual-physical synchronization, and visualization through a service platform. Validation on a two-stage marine compressor package shows that predicted data closely match operating and design values, with MAPE typically <2% for compressor metrics, heat exchanger water flow MAPE≈1.4–1.5%, and recycle flow MAPE≈9.6%. Additional testing on a small-scale compressor package confirms the scalability of the cascaded-stage modeling approach and the DT system, maintaining flow-prediction errors within 5% while requiring only minimal interface configuration and parameter adjustment for direct deployment across packages. These results indicate that the proposed method can effectively extend monitoring capability beyond limited sensor coverage, providing a practical pathway for DT-enabled monitoring and supervisory optimization of marine reciprocating compressor packages."

    "abstract": "Phishing emails are a representative form of dark patterns that visually deceive users and exploit psychological vulnerabilities. This study employed eye-tracking to empirically examine which features in phishing emails are most frequently overlooked. Two commonly encountered phishing categories—emails requiring immediate user action and those prompting account registration—were tested using prototypes modeled after Netflix and Adobe. Each email contained six widely recognized deceptive cues: fake sender address, generic greeting, urgent language, fake hyperlink, brand imitation, and false source assumption. Among these, brand imitation and urgent language received the least visual attention. These cues showed significantly lower fixation duration, fixation count, and revisit count. Paired t-tests revealed that these two cues were statistically less attended than the others (p < .001). Survey responses and heatmaps further confirmed the low detection rates for brand imitation and urgency cues. The findings suggest that visual trust cues (e.g., brand logos) and urgency-based persuasion techniques are particularly effective at bypassing user scrutiny. These results underscore critical perceptual blind spots and highlight the need for improved training and detection systems that incorporate human-computer interaction (HCI) perspectives, addressing subtle visual and psychological manipulation strategies beyond conventional technical indicators."

A soft voting mechanism combines predictions from the individual models to improve accuracy and robustness. The system is further enhanced with a location-aware weather integration layer that dynamically fetches environmental parameters based on the user's geographic coordinates via a RESTful API interface. Extensive experimentation was conducted using a benchmark agricultural dataset, and the ensemble model achieved an accuracy of 98.5%, outperforming individual classifiers. The model is encapsulated within a Flask-based API, enabling real-time deployment for web and mobile applications.

This paper presents a novel Hardware Trojan (HT) that subtly degrades system performance by tampering with the credit-based flow control mechanism. The impact of HT is evaluated using both synthetic traffic and real application benchmarks under varying attack probabilities. Experimental results show that in synthetic traffic, HT can increase packet latency by 25% and reduce throughput by 12%. When evaluated with real benchmarks, the HT causes a 20% increase in packet latency, a 29% reduction in throughput, and a 20% drop in Instructions Per Cycle (IPC), demonstrating substantial performance degradation. These findings show that even minor alteration of credit signals can cause major performance issues, stressing the need for strong hardwarelevel security in NoC systems."

This study introduces DeepRetina, a fine-tuned InceptionV3-based deep learning model, designed to classify Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images into four categories: Normal, Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV), Dia-betic Macular Edema (DME), and Drusen. DeepRetina enhances the standard InceptionV3 architecture by incorporating three pairs of fully connected layers with ReLU activation, batch normalization, and dropout to refine feature representation and improve classification accuracy. The model was validated on the OCT19 dataset, achieving a remarkable classification accuracy of 99.76%, highlighting its potential as a reliable diagnostic assistant. By automating the analysis of OCT images, DeepRetina reduces clinicians' workload, facilitates early detection, and minimizes the risk of vision loss for patients.

    "abstract": "Microbial evolution is a complex process which is driven by different types of mechanisms, like genetic mutations, horizontal gene transfer, mobile genetic elements like plasmids and phages, gene duplication and amplification, insertion sequences and transposable elements, coevolution within microbial communities, and bacterial parallel evolution. The rapid mutation rates of microbes are both challenging and opportunistic, particularly in the fields of medicine and biotechnology. To combat these mutation rates, predicting microbial evolution has become critical. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have emerged as powerful tools that can be used to study large genomic datasets, identify the patterns of evolution, and predict mutations. Adaptive Laboratory Evolution (ALE) studies, particularly in E. coli, have contributed significantly to enhance the predictive models by interconnecting environmental stress conditions with genomic changes. Different frameworks have further increased our understanding by predicting gene gain or gene loss at systems level, giving us a better explanation of microbial diversity and evolution. By combining AI models with multi-omics data, researchers can predict microbial responses to certain environmental changes. This paper dives deep into the role of AI and ML in studying and predicting microbial evolution, and its applications in various fields."

    "abstract": "Support Vector Machine approaches provide efficient classification in data sets with high dimensionality. In prior studies we have presented classification results in a high dimensional metric space constructed from data dependency graphs. These features were demonstrated to be tied to ground truth class labels, and therefore correlated to operational semantics. The dimensionality of the metric space is derived from the quantity of isomorphically unique data dependency graphs within the data set. While successive refinement can reduce the dimensionality and search space, dimensionality at the most coarse-grained level remains very high. We present results from Support Vector Machine classifiers and show high classification accuracy with low false positive rates using features correlated to operational semantics. We train classifiers on the Kaggle 2015 Microsoft Malware data set using a linear SVM classifier (One-vs-Rest and One-vs-One), SVM classifier with RBF kernel, SVM classifier with polynomial kernel, and an SVM classifier with custom kernel based on computing the pairwise Hamming distance. This study obtains a total accuracy of over 93% for a multi-class classification problem using a Linear SVM (One-vs-Rest) classifier. The Linear SVM classifier has the lowest false positive rate and high precision, with 6 of 9 classes having precision above 90%, high F1 scores, and a ROC AUC of 0.98. Non-linear SVM kernels show a decrease in total accuracy which indicates linearity in the associated feature space. The classifier was trained on features correlated with binary operational semantics which are demonstrated to be tied to ground truth class labels."

Using affordance theory and stereotype content model theory as the guiding theories, this study investigated how technological affordances of AI-powered voice assistants affect their usage for older people's care by mediating voice assistants' perceived competence and perceived warmth. This research's primary data comes from an online survey of 178 respondents comprising senior citizens, family members, and caregivers of old age homes. Findings suggest that AI voice assistants' personalization, interactivity, and anthropomorphism significantly increase perceived warmth. While performance expectancy and effort expectancy significantly increase perceived competence. However, social presence did not influence perceived warmth significantly. Perceived warmth and competence positively affect workers' use of AI-powered voice assistants for care for older adults. The findings have practical value for senior care non-profit organizations and the healthcare sector that use AI voice assistants for personalized senior care."

While MLOps has emerged to standardize ML lifecycle management, most current implementations lack intelligent automation, identity-awareness, and mechanisms for incorporating real-time customer feedback. This leads to operational inefficiencies, security vulnerabilities, and reduced model relevance over time. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MLOps framework that integrates AIOps for anomaly detection and self-healing, IAM for policy-based access governance, and customer-informed feedback loops for continuous model adaptation. The architecture is designed for SaaS-based multi-tenant environments and includes unified observability through a telemetry bus. We evaluate the framework using a simulation-based case study in predictive maintenance, tracking key metrics such as Mean Time to Recovery downtime reduction, access anomaly detection, and user satisfaction. Results show over 50% improvement in recovery time, measurable security gains, and increased responsiveness to end-user needs. This study demonstrates the value of combining automation, security, and user-centricity in production-grade ML operations."

    "abstract": "For autonomous navigation of remotely controlled (RC) cars, real-time perception and path planning algorithms are used. Although traditional vision-based approaches for autonomous navigation, such as contour detection or Hough transforms, can be computationally inexpensive approaches for obstacle detection and lane tracking. This paper examines the comparison of contour-based tracking and Hough transform-based detection for vision-based autonomous navigation of a Raspberry Pi based RC car. The benefits of using both methods are examined for stability of trajectory, robustness to curve paths, and environmental noise. Based on the findings of this study, while the contour-based method is robust to irregular-shaped obstacles, the contour-based method did not perform stable lane tracking and was sensitive to environmental noise. In contrast, the Hough transform-based method enhanced stability of the trajectory and dampened oscillations to external environment conditions. Overall the authors of this paper support that the Hough transform is a better approach for real-world autonomous navigation since it showed smoother path-following performance with less computational cost."

    "abstract": "Under Industry 4.0, predictive maintenance has been a key requirement in reducing downtime and maximizing asset performance across sophisticated industrial systems. The proposed research suggests an integrated AI-based framework combining conventional machine learning (ML) techniques (Random Forest, SVM) with deep learning (DL) architectures (CNN, LSTM) and XAI methods like SHAP to ensure transparency and stakeholder confidence. Preprocessed time-series Sensor data from industrial machinery was used to train prediction models for malfunction detection and estimating the remaining useful life (RUL). Real-time deployment was implemented using edge computing to reduce latency and facilitate timely decision-making. Results showed that the LSTM model provided the best performance with 91% precision, 88% recall, and 82.1% RUL accuracy. When combined with SHAP, the model had high accuracy (90% precision, 87% recall) and provided better interpretability. Our work emphasizes the interpretability-latency trade-off since the XAI-enhanced model exhibited a marginally higher latency (110 ms). Nevertheless, the paradigm was successful in providing accurate, real-time, and interpretable predictions. The drawbacks are added computational overhead and the requirement for large-scale labeled data. Follow-on work will prioritize minimizing XAI latency, making data more efficient, and evaluating federated and privacy-preserving learning approaches. This system improves the transparency and trustworthiness of AI applications in industrial predictive maintenance."

Early self-detection and monitoring is critical for timely intervention, but traditional approaches often fail to engage young people effectively or operate at scale. To address this gap, we developed ESFY: Expert System for Youth, a gamified system that leverages digital phenotyping for early identification and continuous self-monitoring of psychological distress. Our work followed a two-stage process: first, we designed the ESFY system by integrating key insights from the prior work; and second, we evaluated the system through a mixed-method user study with (n = 36) participants. ESFY identifies and interprets behavioral and device-derived digital phenotypes that may signal emotional distress, while its gamified design aims to foster sustained engagement and proactive self-care. Initial evaluation results suggest that the system is both usable and promising as a tool for self-monitoring of psychological distress."

    "abstract": "Crater-based localization, which estimates spacecraft position by matching observed lunar craters with global catalogs, is critical for autonomous lunar surface navigationdeep-space navigation. However, traditional geometric matching approaches are highly sensitive to detection noise and computationally intensive, limiting their suitability for real-time onboard applications, particularly in lost-in-space (LIS) scenarios where no prior pose estimate is available. We propose CraterSense, a lightweight and robust localization system that integrates a multi-scale crater detection module with a novel identification framework. By abstracting crater layouts into sparse structural images, visual representations that encode only the centers and diameters of the craters, CraterSense reformulates crater identification as a classification task. This abstraction fundamentally improves robustness to detection errors and allows efficient joint optimization of detection and identification and enables efficient end-to-end learning without reliance on prior pose information. To effectively process these texture-free and geometrically sparse inputs, we introduce CATSformer, a compact Vision Transformer that combines convolutional stems, token selection, central attention, and structural position embedding. Experiments on two representative lunar regions demonstrate that CraterSense achieves up to 98.2% identification accuracy, strong robustness to perturbations, and low-latency inference, supporting real-time deployment in planetary missions. This work provides a structure-aware solution for crater-based localization, achieving high precision and onboard autonomy without prior pose information bridging the gap between high precision and operational autonomy in deep-space exploration."

    "abstract": "In recent years, Channel State Information (CSI), recognized for its fine-grained spatial characteristics, has attracted increasing attention in WiFi-based indoor localization. However, despite its potential, CSI-based approaches have yet to achieve the same level of deployment scale and commercialization as those based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). A key limitation lies in the fact that most existing CSI-based systems are developed and evaluated in controlled, small-scale environments, limiting their generalizability. To bridge this gap, we explore the deployment of a large-scale CSI-based localization system involving over 400 Access Points (APs) in a real-world building under the Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) paradigm. We highlight two critical yet often overlooked factors: the underutilization of unlabeled data and the inherent heterogeneity of CSI measurements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CSI-based learning framework for WiFi localization, tailored for large-scale ISAC deployments on the server side. Specifically, we employ a novel graph-based structure to model heterogeneous CSI data and reduce redundancy. We further design a pretext pretraining task that incorporates spatial and temporal priors to effectively leverage large-scale unlabeled CSI data. Complementarily, we introduce a confidence-aware fine-tuning strategy to enhance the robustness of localization results.

Comparisons with MODIS Dark Target (DT), Deep Blue (DB), and Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) aerosol products across four seasons further confirm the consistency of our retrievals. The global distributions of annual mean aerosol properties align well with expected spatial patterns, highlighting the potential of DPC-2/GF-5(02) for robust global aerosol monitoring.

The OEO consists of electrical and optical paths. In the electronic path, two transimpedance amplifiers (TIA) cores are employed to receive the photocurrent from photodiode (PD) in the gain loop and PD in the loss loop of the PT-symmetric OEO respectively. An active combiner synthesizes signals in the electrical domain and converts them into differential signals, simultaneously functioning as an active balun. The combined signal is processed through an active vector-sum phase shifter (VSPS) and a driving amplifier (DRV) to drive the optical phase modulator (PM). A feedforward coupling capacitor is employed to enhance the CMRR of the active balun and improve the phase control accuracy and operational bandwidth of the VSPS, which is beneficial for enhancing the side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) of the PT-symmetric OEO. The optical path comprises a PT-symmetric mode-selection structure, which is composed of a polarization controller (PC), a polarization beam splitter (PBS), and photodetectors (PD), and a microwave photonic filter with a phase modulator (PM) and a phase-shifted fiber Bragg grating (PS-FBG).

The constructed OEO achieves a frequency tuning range of 4-12GHz, a phase noise of -110.4 dBc/Hz at 10kHz offset, and a SMSR of 47.3dB. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first fully-integrated electronic path IC, tailored for PT-symmetric OEO, which achieves a relative tuning range of around 100% and a side-mode rejection of 47.3dB."

    "abstract": "Several lightweight protocols are being developed to secure communication in resource-constrained environments. Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman over COSE (EDHOC) plays a key role in this lightweight protocol family by managing the key establishment process. However, due to the vulnerability of the discrete logarithm problem to Shor’s algorithm, a quantum-resistant replacement for Diffie-Hellman is required. This work examines the quantum-resistant transition of EDHOC, focusing on its multiple authentication methods as a step toward enabling robust post-quantum security for IoT devices. A novel authentication method for EDHOC is introduced, utilizing Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) as a replacement for the static Diffie-Hellman (DH) authentication method, providing a post-quantum signature-free alternative. Among existing post-quantum algorithms for both KEMs and signatures, the NIST-standardized ML-KEM offers the fastest implementation at the lowest memory cost, both of which are crucial for resource-constrained devices. While compatible with various post-quantum KEMs, the method can exploit the computational efficiency of ML-KEM to bring a PQ Signature-free EDHOC to highly constrained devices, providing the same security guarantees as classical EDHOC once the handshake is complete. Additionally, an efficient three-message handshake KEM-based EDHOC Initiator Known Responder (IKR) variant is proposed for environments with pre-established peer awareness."

Due to its dynamic nature, the organizations are facing difficulties in determining the exact type of attack. To address this problem, this research paper presents a novel, optimized hybrid deep learning model. The projected model includes four major phases: “(a) pre-processing, (b) feature extraction, (c) feature selection, and (d) attack detection”. Initially, raw data is collected and pre-processed using a data cleaning algorithm. Statistical characteristics, including proposed weighted entropy and higher-order statistical features such as skewness and kurtosis, are retrieved from the pre-processed data during the feature extraction step. The most optimal features are selected from the extracted characteristics utilizing the newly proposed Aquila Customized Sunflower Optimization Algorithm (ACSOA). The Aquila Optimizer (AO) and the standard sunflower optimization (SnFO) algorithms are combined in this ACSOA model. Finally, the attack detection and classification are carried out in the newly built optimized hybrid classifier framework, which is made up of optimized Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Gated Recurrent Network (GRU). The weight of the RNN will be fine-tuned using ACSOA to improve the detection accuracy of the projected model. The type of APT assault in network traffic will be depicted in the final detection result using the improved hybrid classifier architecture. Finally, the efficiency of the anticipated model is validated by a comparative examination."

However, current end-to-end approaches tend to prioritize optimizations and hidden states, often overlooking the decision-making framework, which poses ongoing challenges in safety and comfort. This study introduces DREWM, A Decision-Refined End-to-End World Model, which leverages the world model alongside a sample-evaluation decision-making framework to improve decision-making efficiency, safety, and comfort. By incorporating a trajectory sampling and optimization strategy within a world model, we establish a hybrid decision framework that enables robust vehicle control and optimized route planning in complex driving conditions. Specifically, this work first applies a generative perception network to extract both two-dimensional and three-dimensional perception features from monocular camera inputs, followed by distribution-fitting sampling to obtain environmental dynamic information. Then the Self-Transformer architecture enhances the model's capability to represent implicit features of environmental dynamic information. In the decoding phase, safety and comfort metrics guide the selection and adjustment of pre-generated trajectories, leading to control outputs. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher levels of safety and driving comfort across diverse scenarios compared to approaches solely based on deep learning. Testing in CARLA environments indicates that DREWM outperforms baseline models and other state-of-the-art methods in Driving Score, offering a promising solution for real-world applications of end-to-end autonomous driving systems."

    "abstract": "Cropland Change Detection (CCD) is a critical technological means for ensuring food security and advancing agricultural sustainability, holding significant application value in remote sensing image interpretation. However, prevalent domain shifts between bi-temporal remote sensing images—caused by land cover phenological variations (e.g., crop growth cycles) and multi-source imaging disparities (e.g., sensor differences, illumination changes, atmospheric interference)—severely degrade the detection accuracy and robustness of conventional methods. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end domain adaptation framework named MDANet for cropland change detection, which innovatively integrates the long-sequence modeling capability of Mamba with domain-invariant feature learning strategies. First, a Mamba-based domain adaptation method is constructed to conduct cross-domain alignment of bi-temporal images, aiming to eliminate domain shifts caused by imaging and geographical differences. Specifically, a source-target weight adjustment mechanism is designed to adaptively balance the migration degree of image source and target features, and two identity losses are proposed to preserve the geospatial structure and semantic consistency of croplands. Then, a cross-domain feature alignment and fusion mechanism is designed to align transformed features via domain-invariant learning, effectively suppressing pseudo-changes and enhancing discriminability in genuine change regions. Experimental results on JLYHCD, CLCD, and Hi-CNA datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves F1-scores of 79.87%, 81.94%, and 87.24%, respectively, outperforming existing advanced change detection approaches and exhibiting superior detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization capability.

To address this problem, this study proposes a separation method for sun gear vibration signals based on a multi-path enhanced convolutional sparse representation. According to the planetary gearbox transmission path mechanism, the method constructs a dual-dictionary for both in-box and out-of-box transmission paths of sun gear vibration. Furthermore, the Generalized Minimax Concave penalty and forward-backward splitting algorithm are introduced to solve the sparse coefficients. These improvements enhance the computational efficiency and signal reconstruction performance of the convolutional sparse representation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified under various sun gear fault conditions using both simulated and experimental data. Comparisons with L1-norm regularization and K-singular value decomposition dictionary learning methods demonstrate that the proposed method offers higher accuracy and faster processing, contributing to a more reliable diagnosis of sun gear crack faults."

Artificial skin stretch stimulation has emerged as a preferred method to convey proprioceptive cues, but current friction-based devices face limitations preventing integration into practical prostheses. This work investigates magnetically induced skin stretch as a non-invasive, potentially implantable alternative. We present MISS (Magnetically Induced Skin Stretch), a novel system that uses external coils to control magnets adhered to the skin, producing skin deformations that mimic subdermal implantation and evoke proprioceptive sensations. We conducted physical and psychophysical experiments, including Just Noticeable Difference and Point of Subjective Equality measurements. Eighteen participants, including five with transradial amputation, used the MISS device with a myoelectric prosthesis, where skin stretch was modulated in sync with prosthetic hand flexion. Results showed high object discrimination accuracy, with amputees performing comparably to able-bodied users. These findings demonstrate MISS as a promising proprioceptive feedback method, supporting its future integration into implantable systems."

Methods and techniques exist for completing security analysis on systems in which some architecture definition is complete. However, there exists a gap in methods to elicit early system security requirements, leading to deficient security considerations in the conceptual design phase of complex cyber physical systems. The EGRESS method introduced in this work fills this need. It builds upon best practices from MBSE, Systems Thinking, Systems Theory, and Systems Security standards to offer a user-friendly approach to generating early system goals addressing system security. Utilizing EGRESS maximizes the system design trade space to achieve a system that is secure by design, specifying goals forming the baseline of further security requirement elicitation throughout the system design process."

    "abstract": "Few-shot action recognition seeks to recognize novel actions with limited labeled examples. While dual-modal approaches incorporating video and textual modalities offer enhanced semantic context, existing methods often rely on naive feature fusion strategies, failing to capture deep semantic correlations across modalities and limiting generalization. We propose DPCA-Net, a dual-modal metric learning framework that constructs a unified dual-prototype consistency alignment space. DPCA-Net explicitly models distributional, structural, and metric consistency across modalities to enhance prototype quality and similarity estimation. It integrates three core components: (1) Frame-wise Text-guided Modeling (FTM), which uses conditional prompt learning to embed video frame-level visual features into the textual space, achieving structural consistency; (2) Dual-Modal Metric Learning via dual-path Dynamic Time Warping (Dual-DTW), jointly aligning visual and cross-modal prototypes to ensure metric consistency; and (3) Distribution Consistency Mapping (DCM), which leverages Maximum Mean Discrepancy and cosine similarity to align support-query distributions and reinforce representation robustness. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that DPCA-Net consistently outperforms prior methods. It surpasses CLIP-FSAR by 1.3%–2.7%, achieving 89.7% (1-shot) on Kinetics and 99.12% (5-shot) on UCF-101. These results highlight the effectiveness of consistency-driven prototype alignment for robust and generalizable cross-modal few-shot action recognition."

    "abstract": "Source-Free unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to classify target samples by only accessing a pre-trained source model and unlabelled target samples. Since no source data is available, transferring the knowledge from the source domain to the target domain is challenging. Existing methods normally exploit the pair-wise relation among target samples and attempt to discover their correlations by clustering these samples based on semantic features. The drawbacks of these methods include: 1) the pair-wise relation is limited to exposing the underlying correlations of two more samples, hindering the exploration of the structural information embedded in the target domain; and 2) the clustering process only relies on the semantic feature, while overlooking the critical effect of domain shift, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i>, the distribution differences between the source and target domains. To address these issues, we propose a new SFDA method that exploits the high-order neighborhood relation and explicitly takes the domain shift effect into account. Specifically, we formulate the SFDA as a hypergraph learning problem and construct hyperedges to explore the deep structural and context information among multiple samples. Moreover, we integrate a self-loop strategy into the constructed hypergraph to elegantly introduce the domain uncertainty of each sample. By clustering these samples based on hyperedges, both the semantic feature and domain shift effects are considered. We then describe an adaptive relation-based objective to tune the model with soft attention levels for all samples. Extensive experiments are conducted on Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA, DomainNet-126 and PointDA-10 datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art counterparts.

The point-level label, especially single-point supervision, can simultaneously preserve spatial positions as well as take light annotation time, which is particularly advantageous in alleviating the human labeling burden. However, how to obtain satisfactory parsing performance under limited sparse point annotations is challenging, which requires further investigation. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end Point Evolution Hierarchy human parsing Network (PEHNet) for fine-grained human parsing task that just leverages single-point supervision. Motivated by the concept of a divide-and-conquer strategy, we partition all pixels into three distinct groups, i.e., single-point labels, pseudo-region labels, and unlabeled pixels, then optimize each group with suitable mechanisms. To expand the coverage of single-point labels, we introduce a point dissemination module that generates high-quality pseudo-region labels. Furthermore, the point-level spatial position information inherently preserves the structural characteristics of the human body. Inspired by this hierarchical property, we devise a point-level human hierarchy-wise constraint that guides the prediction probabilities to align with the inherent hierarchy of the human body. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PEHNet outperforms state-of-the-art parsing methods on two popular human parsing benchmark datasets (LIP and ATR) and one semantic segmentation dataset (Pascal VOC 2012)."

While machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in detecting such attacks, their opaque decisionmaking limits operator trust and real-world applicability. This paper proposes a hybrid framework that integrates lightweight ML-based attack detection with natural language explanations generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Classifiers such as LightGBM achieve up to $95.13 \\%$ attack detection accuracy with only 0.004 s inference latency. Upon detecting a cyberattack, the system invokes LLMs-including GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o mini-to generate human-readable explanation of the event. Evaluated on 100 test samples, GPT-4o mini with 20 -shot prompting achieved $93 \\%$ accuracy in identifying the attack target, a mean absolute error of 0.075 pu in estimating attack magnitude, and 2.19 seconds mean absolute error (MAE) in estimating attack onset. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively balances real-time detection with interpretable, high-fidelity explanations, addressing a critical need for actionable AI in smart grid cybersecurity."

From experiments, we analyzed four AI algorithms that include: GANs, CNNs, RNNs, and LSTM. At a first, GANs obtained the visual quality at around $78 \\%$ while the consistency in the styles was not stable. A study on CNNs proved that the model achieved an $85 \\%$ accuracy in classifying artistic styles and therefore the model’s efficiency in art analysis. There was also a slightly better performance of LSTMs with $78 \\%$ of coherence in generated text while RNNs had $72 \\%$; the models also produced text that was deeper in emotion as compared to the input. Analyzing the results, it can be concluded that AI is capable of creating as well as interpreting artworks with moderate accuracy; however, it stumbles when it comes to mimicking all the shades of humans’ emotion and style. This paper helps to shed some light on the subject of the arts in which AI is already present and both opportunities and challenges therein. Further studies are required to optimise these algorithms and to understand AI’s impact on the creative professions."

This problem demands focus not only due to its environmental impact but also due to the high energy costs faced by MNOs. Though several advancements were made in this field by previous researchers, there remains a gap in the employment of Metaheuristic techniques to optimise the parameters of base stations. This paper deals with the dynamic optimisation of the Energy Efficiency (EE) of wireless cellular networks by utilising nature-inspired techniques on real-time data. A real-world dataset from Kaggle has been used in this work to optimise EE by adjusting the parameters such as throughput, signal strength and latency of 3G, 4G, LTE and 5G networks through the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) technique. This AI-driven approach analyses the performance of several wireless cellular networks based on several key parameters and shows how GWO successfully achieved a 92.3% enhancement over the overall EE. Therefore, green communication could be achieved by utilising such nature-inspired optimization algorithms to achieve scalable solutions."

Results show that AI offers notable benefits in accuracy, adaptability, and real-time response. Additionally, Explainable AI (XAI) emerges as a critical component for transparency and compliance with regulatory standards. However, challenges remain, including algorithmic bias, ethical concerns, and data privacy issues.

However, the non-stationarity, nonlinear characteristics, and noise interference of load sequences make it difficult for traditional prediction methods to capture their complexity, thus reducing the prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, deep neural networks are susceptible to gradient vanishing and gradient explosion, which further constrains the prediction performance. To this end, this paper constructs a hybrid model SV-CBA-XGB with parameters optimized by Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA), which firstly realizes the multiscale decomposition of the original load sequence by SSA-seeking optimal Variable Difference Modal Decomposition (VMD); subsequently, an integrated CNN-BIGRU-Attention (CBA) model consisting of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BIGRU), and Attention is used to perform deep feature extraction and time-series modeling of highfrequency complex components, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for efficient prediction of low-frequency smooth components. The experimental results show that SV-CBA-XGB significantly outperforms both the single model and the traditional hybrid method in terms of prediction precision and reliability."

    "abstract": "A fully integrated low-noise phase-locked loop (PLL) frequency synthesizer in SiGe-BiCMOS technology is presented. Two parallel tuning loops for fine and coarse tuning of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) are used to obtain a constant loop dynamics, resulting in a phase noise spectrum fairly independent of the PLL output frequency. A low in-band phase noise floor is achieved by a differential phase-frequency detector (PFD) followed by an integrated active loop filter using only SiGe-HBTs as active devices. A low VCO gain is obtained by combining varactor switching and inductor switching in the VCO, resulting in 16 subbands. The subband selection is achieved by an automated frequency calibration (AFC) loop using two Schmitt triggers. In order to obtain a stable subband selection loop, the AFC block is triggered by the coarse tuning voltage in conjunction with an overdamped coarse tuning loop. By monitoring this tuning voltage under X-ray irradiation, total ionizing dose (TID) effects on the SiGe-HBT based VCO frequency are quantified. The VCO frequency change is below 0.2% up to a total dose of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2 \\text{Mrad}\\left(\\text{SiO}_{2}\\right)$</tex>.

The stand-alone generation system comprises PV panels and a battery storage system (BSS). The objective function for this optimization problem is to minimize the unavailability and cost of the proposed stand-alone system with different kinds of PV panels. However, the optimum sizing cannot be accomplished without considering and covering the system reliability and constraints. The effectiveness of HO algorithm is investigated, and its performance is compared with that of the Particle swarm optimization algorithm. The simulation results reveal the validity and superiority of $\\mathbf{H O}$ technique in determining the optimal sizing of a PV generation system with a higher convergence rate, lower annual cost and LPSP than the PSO technique and it show that polycrystallinePV solar/battery systems are more suitable for the proposed location than monocrystalline-PV solar/battery systems, due to economic, technical, and environmental conditions."

    "abstract": "Pavement distress, such as cracks and potholes, is a significant issue affecting road safety and maintenance. In this study, we present the implementation and evaluation of Bidirectional Cascaded Neural Networks (BCNNs) for the classification of pavement crack images following image augmentation. We classified pavement cracks into three main categories: linear cracks, potholes, and fatigue cracks on an enhanced dataset utilizing U-Net 50 for image augmentation. The augmented dataset comprised 599 images. Our proposed BCNN model was designed to leverage both forward and backward information flows, with detection accuracy enhanced by its cascaded structure wherein each layer progressively refines the output of the preceding one. Our model achieved an overall accuracy of $87 \\%$, with precision, recall, and F1-score measures indicating high effectiveness across the categories. For fatigue cracks, the model recorded a precision of 0.87, recall of 0.83, and F1-score of 0.85 on 205 images. Linear cracks were detected with a precision of 0.81, recall of 0.89, and F1-score of 0.85 on 205 images, and potholes with a precision of 0.96, recall of 0.90, and F1-score of 0.93 on 189 images. The macro and weighted average of precision, recall, and F1-score were identical at 0.88, confirming the BCNN’s excellent performance in classifying complex pavement crack patterns. This research demonstrates the potential of BCNNs to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of pavement distress classification, resulting in more effective and efficient pavement maintenance and management systems."

However, a critical challenge remains the presence of unused word lines in the crossbar array, which leads to low resource utilization and inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose a novel circuit design that mitigates the influences of low utilization due to unused rows by introducing the alternating current (AC) signal into the system. At the end of each bitline, peripheral circuits—including amplifiers, a filter array, and envelope detectors—are combined to distinguish each operation effectively. We applied LeNet5, VGG8, and ResNet to three datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and MNIST. Experimental results demonstrate that during the neural network inference, the accuracy of our work drops by less than 1% for all tested workloads when the variation is as high as 10%. Among them, LeNet5-MNIST shows the highest tolerance, with an accuracy loss of less than 1% when variation is up to 30%.

    "abstract": "Legacy generations of FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) devices were optimized for fixed-point operation. Significant resource utilization, power consumption, and processing bandwidth penalties have long been associated with using them for floating-point implementations. FPGA suppliers have changed this paradigm by including hardened floating-point Digital Signal Processing (DSP) blocks in their devices and by expanding support tools to ease the burden of implementing floating-point algorithms in these devices. The result is a massive increase in the floating-point capability of FPGA based solutions, with performance in excess of 40 Teraflops theoretically possible in the latest devices. Understanding the possibilities created by this new capability, and methods by which to capitalize on them in future applications, is high value for engineers working in DSP. Broadening knowledge of the silicon features, operating modes, and related design tools is critical to enabling wide scale use of the technology. This paper details the state-of-the-art in floating-point FPGA hardware and support tools, and provides an assessment of each with the goal of facilitating further adoption. Applications in which floating-point FPGAs represent a critical advantage are presented along with implementation and simulation examples to demonstrate tool flow and achievable performance."

    "abstract": "In today's digital world, harmful software poses a significant threat to computer systems and networks. Ransomware is a type of malware (malicious software) that locks users' files and demands money to unlock them. Hackers use this attack as a medium to earn money in unethical manner from the users. Thus, growing usage of such attacks can cause serious harm to social economy. Several approaches have been designed to analyse ransomware attacks. Traditional detection methods often rely on predefined signatures, making it difficult to recognize new and evolving threats. The paper focuses on detection of ransomware threats using machine learning approaches and proposes Optimized Decision Tree (ODT) machine learning approach. Machine learning enhances security by analysing behavioural patterns, allowing early detection before serious damage occurs. Machine learning approaches like Decision Tree (DT), XGBoost, and proposed approach are considered in this work for predicting file encryption behaviour, network communication pattern, and system anomalies. These approaches aid in detecting normal and potential security threats, raising the detection level of improper attempts at encryption. The results shows that ODT model optimized better with hyperparameter tuning and features has a high accuracy (success rate of 99.4%) for threat detection. The ODT approach is highly effective for identification of security threats in real-world ransomware attacks."

A Launch Vehicle is a rocket powered space transport system used to send payloads such as satellites and other space probes in to their intended orbits.Position control of the Launch Vehicle is very critical as any deviation may result in the loss of trajectory of the Launch Vehicle which will adversely affect the mission. The main components of the position control system are Actuators and Control electronics. An Actuator is a combination of motor, position sensor, a mounting mechanism, and a rotary to linear converter. Electro Mechanical Actuators are widely used considering their advantages such as maintainability and serviceability. In Launch Vehicle applications, Quadruplex Coil Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) based position control systems are used. For high power applications PMSM based drive is invariably used considering its numerous advantages.Torque ripple is a matter of concern in PMSM as it produces oscillations and resonance which are undesirable. In the position control of launch vehicles where no errors are permitted, such oscillations cannot be afforded as it may adversely affect the trajectory of launch vehicles and the entire mission.This paper discusses in detail the modelling of the PMSM drive with various control methods for reduced torque ripple and improved efficiency for the position control system of Launch Vehicles. Models are developed in MATLAB/Simulink. Open loop, closed loop FOC models with PI controllers developed and results are analysed for various load torques."

    "abstract": "Obesity is a multifaceted and increasing health problem linked with severe chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Proper classification of obesity levels using personal health information can help in early detection and focused prevention. In this research, a cascade machine learning architecture integrating Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network models for multi-class obesity prediction is proposed. The method dynamically chooses the classifier depending on confidence levels: high-confidence instances are processed by Logistic Regression for performance, medium-confidence instances by Random Forest for strength, and low-confidence instances by a neural network for greater depth of learning. The model was trained and tested on a structured dataset with behavior, lifestyle, and anthropometric attributes. After preprocessing and normalization, the hybrid model exhibited competitive performance in all obesity classes. Performance metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and precision-recall analysis ensured the robustness of the system. This cascaded classification approach identifies a potential direction for constructing intelligent and resource-sensitive predictive systems in health informatics."

Early detection plays a crucial role in managing the disease and improving patient outcomes. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of voice-based biomarkers for the diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease, derived from clinically validated voice recordings. The dataset was collected from two reputed medical institutions: Shriman Hospital, Jalandhar, and KIMS Hospital, Secunderabad, ensuring a diverse and representative sample population. Each participant, both PD patients and healthy controls, was asked to perform standardized speech tasks in a controlled environment. High-quality voice recordings were obtained and processed to extract 22 distinct vocal features, including measures of frequency perturbation (jitter), amplitude perturbation (shimmer), noise-to-harmonics ratios, and non-linear dynamic features such as D2, RPDE, and PPE. These parameters are known to reflect the phonatory and articulatory impairments commonly observed in PD patients. The study not only describes the data collection protocol in a clinical setting but also provides a detailed statistical analysis of the extracted features to highlight their diagnostic significance. By comparing the vocal profiles of PD and non-PD individuals, we identify key acoustic markers that distinguish between the two groups. This paper aims to contribute a high-quality, clinically validated voice dataset and demonstrate its potential for developing accurate, non-invasive diagnostic models using machine learning techniques."

Driven by campus mandates for efficiency, reliability, and sustainability, the planning framework studies and identifies the optimal investment scenario for upgrading the existing PV capacity and incorporating a battery energy storage system (BESS). The practical framework integrates the operational intricacies of the CHP plant and the modeling complexities of the Alberta electricity market, including the pool price and the nonlinear transmission and distribution fees (T&D). By considering various stochastic scenarios regarding electricity price, load growth, and gas price, the study develops a daily optimization approach to consider the intricacies of the electricity market, formulating the optimization framework as a mixed-integer linear programming stochastic problem. Reported key performance metrics include the net present cost (NPC) and the saving-to-investment ratio (SIR) over the planning horizon.

    "abstract": "We present a fast and efficient volumetric capture and reconstruction system that processes either RGB-D or RGB-only input to generate 3D representations in the form of point clouds and Gaussian splats. For Gaussian splat reconstructions, we took the GPS-Gaussian regressor and improved it, enabling high-quality reconstructions with minimal overhead. The system is designed for easy setup and deployment, supporting in-the-wild operation under uncontrolled illumination and arbitrary backgrounds, as well as flexible camera configurations, including sparse setups, arbitrary camera numbers and baselines. Captured data can be exported in standard formats such as PLY, MPEG V-PCC, and SPLAT, and visualized through a web-based viewer or Unity/Unreal plugins. A live on-location preview of both input and reconstruction is available at 5–10 FPS. We present qualitative findings focused on deployability and targeted ablations. The complete framework is open-source, facilitating reproducibility and further research."

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation is crucial for environmental monitoring by enabling precise land cover mapping and change detection from satellite imagery. Although recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved segmentation performance, most existing models are designed for specific tasks. They are often trained on single-source satellite imagery, which limits their adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we propose TerraSegNet, a lightweight bilateral network that separates the extraction of spatial detail and semantic context through a dual-path architecture. The model integrates convolutional axial attention in the context path to capture long-range dependencies efficiently while maintaining compatibility with convolutional backbones. We evaluated TerraSegNet on four different remote sensing tasks using five publicly available satellite imagery datasets: cloud detection on SPARCS (Landsat 8) and WHUS2-CD+ (Sentinel-2), photovoltaic panel segmentation on PV08 (Gaofen-2), paddy rice mapping on Plot-Rice v1.0 (Sentinel-1), and ground terrain classification on AIR-PolSAR-Seg-2.0 (Gaofen-3). All training is performed independently per dataset without cross-domain transfer learning, ensuring a fair evaluation of in-domain performance. TerraSegNet achieves mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) scores of 0.8608, 0.9364, 0.9617, 0.7777, and 0.9207 on SPARCS, WHUS2-CD+, PV08, Plot-Rice v1.0, and AIR-PolSAR-Seg-2.0, respectively. These results outperform baselines and demonstrate its effectiveness for various environmental applications."

    "abstract": "Transparent objects are common in daily life and industry, necessitating that robots be able to perceive and manipulate them. The physical properties of reflection and refraction pose challenges for accurately reconstructing the 3D geometry of transparent objects. Conventional methods, which rely on simultaneous estimation of background ambient light and complex refraction fields, lack robustness in real-world scenes, thereby impeding robotic grasping performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes TORM, a novel framework for robust reconstruction and manipulation of multiple transparent objects. TORM focuses on semantic information from transparent objects and employs multi-view segmentation masks to constrain a self-supervised multi-object deep marching tetrahedra (DMTet-Multi) 3D fitting process. To mitigate the risk of the geometry representation getting stuck in suboptimal solutions during multi-transparent-object reconstruction, we design a novel loss function that prevents marching tetrahedra from crossing boundaries. By applying a connectivity determination strategy to the fitted mesh, transparent objects can be processed in parallel by a grasp perception network, predicting the end-effector configuration for grasp tasks. Real-world experiments demonstrate that TORM achieves an 88.8% grasping success rate in multi-transparent-object grasping tasks.

    "abstract": "Modern computing systems are increasingly adopting low-precision floating-point formats to reduce memory overhead, particularly in large-scale applications such as large language models and scientific computing. Low-precision formats, however, are vulnerable to reduced numerical accuracy and provide only a limited dynamic range. The posit format, which incorporates a variable-length regime structure, has gained attention for providing higher precision and a broader dynamic range compared to conventional low-precision floating-point representations. Despite such advantages, conventional computing architectures are still based on IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic, where achieving parallel and efficient posit-to-floating-point decoding remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a Compute-in-Memory (CIM) architecture for posit-to-floating-point conversion that leverages the inherent parallelism of memory arrays to perform concurrent conversion of multiple posit values in a fixed number of cycles with negligible hardware overhead. The architecture implements key modules for posit decoding through bitwise in-memory logic operations, extending the state-of-the-art PIM microarchitecture to enable a wider range of micro-operations. Experimental results based on RRAM crossbar simulation demonstrate an average improvements of 3.3× and 5.04× in throughput and energy efficiency, respectively, compared to a baseline CMOS decoding architecture."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for human posture classification using two specialized Transformer architectures. The broader goal is to leverage recognized posture sequences to infer complex human actions, like distinguishing ‘sitting down’ from ‘standing up’, for applications like human–robot interaction and intelligent interface systems. While Transformers excel in NLP and image tasks, their potential for 3D skeleton-based posture classification remains underexplored. State-of-the-art action recognition methods often rely on deep, resource-intensive networks struggling with viewpoint variability and temporal inconsistency, and requiring large annotated datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce two lightweight, effective transformer variants: the Central Posture Transformer (CPT) and Isolated Attention Transformer (IAT). CPT uses a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">central posture mechanism</i> to identify and emphasize the most representative frame within a sequence via contextual attention, enhancing interpretability and efficiency. IAT <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">decouples spatial and sequential attention</i>, first modeling joint relationships before integrating temporal dynamics, improving modularity and robustness. These design choices distinguish our models from standard transformers, which compute attention uniformly across all input tokens. Evaluated on the customWUT-20 dataset and publicPKU-MMD benchmark, IAT achieves top accuracy on WUT-20 (0.9981 for 12-frame sequences and 0.9963 for 8-frame sequences), while CPT excels on PKU-MMD (0.9573 and 0.9349). Both outperform baselines such as Ts-CNN, IndRNN, and PoSeqTNet by over 3% in most settings. Qualitative results show CPT’s discriminative posture extraction and IAT’s robustness to temporal resolution changes. Overall, our models achieve high accuracy, computational efficiency, and generalizability across datasets, making them well-suited for real-time human-centered applications in constrained or diverse environments."

The method is developed to address the specific failure mode of glass fracture and is based on Weibull analysis and weakest link theory. It considers the varying stress profile across the module to calculate the probability of glass fracture, which is used as the metric of equivalency. An idealized nonuniform loading scheme is employed to demonstrate the method and introduce the concept of the equivalent uniform load factor: a factor applied to the maximum pressure of the nonuniform load to obtain the equivalent uniform load value. It is demonstrated that this factor is less than unity for all nonuniform load cases considered, including snow and various characters of wind loading. These significant results suggest that uniform loading may be reliably, and practically, employed to evaluate photovoltaic module glass for nonuniform loading durability."

    "abstract": "Designing multi-antennas with multiple functions covering all the bands in a compact handset platform presents substantial challenges in impedance matching, decoupling, and radiation pattern synthesis, especially under user interaction and integration constraints. This paper proposes a turnkey design framework based on the internal multiport method (IMPM), which leverages scattering matrix formulations to enable matrix-based evaluation of antenna performance without manual analysis or mode identification. By integrating this model into the NSGA-III evolutionary algorithm, the entire antenna configuration is optimized holistically as a package, including feeding port placement, reactive load tuning, and shorting control. Different from conventional designs that focus on a single or limited number of antenna elements, the proposed framework automatically synthesizes a four-antenna cellular system and a dual-antenna satellite system on the same platform. Both states share the same hardware and can be reconfigured using only five switching points. The cellular state supports 2×2 and 4×4 MIMO operation across 0.69 to 4.2 GHz, while the satellite state achieves wide-beam endfire radiation in the n256 band with a 4.6 dB gain improvement. Prototypes were fabricated, and measurements demonstrated close agreement with simulations, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Aerial manipulation has attracted growing interest due to the increasing demand for unmanned systems capable of performing complex tasks in hazardous or hard-to-reach environments, such as pipeline maintenance. Existing aerial manipulators often employ serial or parallel arm architectures, each with inherent limitations: serial arms offer a wide workspace but compromise stability, while parallel arms enhance stability but are restricted in orientation control and workspace range. To address these challenges, this paper presents a new aerial manipulator that integrates a quadrotor with a compact 3-DOF hybrid parallelogram-based arm and a dual-tool end-effector. The design achieves efficient task-space reachability through a cantilevered structure and improved stability via fixed-base actuation. It also enables decoupled orientation, allowing independent and precise control of the end-effector’s direction to meet task-specific requirements. Comprehensive kinematic and dynamic models are developed, and a closed-form inverse kinematics solution is derived to ensure accurate task-space positioning and motion execution. To ensure robustness under disturbances with fast convergence, smooth control signals, and reduced chattering, a hybrid control scheme is proposed that combines a backstepping controller with an adaptive disturbance estimation for position tracking, together with an adaptive fast terminal sliding mode controller featuring a singularity-free sliding surface and a continuous super-twisting reaching law for attitude and manipulator joint tracking. The controller is based on a systematic derivation approach that enables fast computation and low implementation complexity. The modeling and control framework is implemented and validated in MATLAB Simulink and Simscape, and a prototype is developed for deployment in real-world aerial manipulation scenarios."

By configuring the reflection beamforming codebook, RIS focuses signals on target receivers to enhance signal strength. In this paper, we investigate the codebook configuration for both continuous-phase and 1-bit RIS-aided communication systems. We formulate an implicit relationship between user coordinates and the optimal codebook from the perspective of electromagnetic wave propagation mechanisms, and introduce a novel learning-based method, implicit neural representations (INRs), to solve this implicit coordinates-to-codebook mapping problem. Our approach requires only user coordinates, avoiding reliance on explicit channel models. For continuous-phase RIS, we introduce a phase normalization technique to address the periodicity and global phase offset challenges inherent in phase representation. Additionally, for the practical 1-bit RIS scenario, we formulate the codebook configuration as a multi-label classification problem and propose an encoding strategy to reduce codebook dimension, thereby improving learning efficiency. Experimental results from both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate significant advantages of our unified method across both continuous and 1-bit codebook configurations.

To facilitate clinical adoption, there is a pressing need for compact, user-friendly handheld probes. In this work, we present a novel handheld integrated dual-modal probe designed around a custom H-plane bent rectangular horn antenna. A key innovation lies in the system-level integration of a miniaturized microwave source (37 cm × 32 cm × 10 cm) and a compact laser module (60 mm × 34 mm × 26 mm), resulting in a fully portable imaging platform. This system uniquely combines TA imaging for mapping tissue dielectric properties with PA imaging for delineating vascular morphology. The core antenna (34 mm × 17 mm × 90 mm, 84 g), specifically engineered for this probe, operates in the 5.8–6.0 GHz band. Experimental characterization demonstrated a spatial resolution of 1.31 mm for TA imaging and 0.75 mm for PA imaging. The dual-modal capability was successfully validated using tissue-mimicking phantoms containing fine black sutures (0.1 mm diameter) and saline-filled targets (1 mm diameter). Finally, clinical potential was confirmed through in vivo imaging of a human finger. These results collectively affirm that the developed handheld TA/PA probe, based on a compact and novel H-plane bent horn antenna design, represents a significant step forward for clinical applications such as vascular diagnostics, finger joint assessment, and Image-Based Hyperthermia Guidance."

To achieve this, we divide the problem into three sub-problems and employ the Dinkelbach technique to solve the EE optimisation. The Concave-Convex Procedure (CCCP) and Lagrange Multiplier technique are used to find the optimal power of VGs and V2I users. A weighted bipartite matching algorithm is used for the spectrum reuse matching problem. Furthermore, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is analysed to assess its practical feasibility. The system performance is evaluated in terms of EE under varying path loss exponents, VG transmit power levels, and the number of VGs. System fairness is evaluated in terms of Jain’s Fairness Index (JFI). The simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves in terms of EE while ensuring that the QoS requirements of both VGs and V2I users are met. The proposed scheme is also compared with existing schemes in terms of EE."

In this work, we studied a frail, post open-heart surgery cohort (52 normal, and 25 AFib elderly patients) and identified novel AFib-specific spatiotemporal and balance control markers by integrating instrumented treadmill analytics with principal component analysis (PCA) techniques. Using clinical gait protocols and instrumented analytics, we captured gait balance changes in frail elders with and without AFib, deriving robust markers of temporal control, bilateral support, and postural symmetry/dynamic stability. Compared with the normal group, AFib patients exhibited longer stride/step times (+0.30 seconds/+0.15–0.16 seconds; Cohen <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i>=0.77–0.79), lower cadence (−14.92 steps/min; Cohen <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i>=−0.84) and slower velocity (−0.24 Km/h; Cohen <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i>=−0.6), with a modest shift toward longer left stance/shorter left swing (~±2.66; Cohen <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i>≈±0.59); These significant differences reflect temporal instability characterized by loss of cadence regularity, longer step-to-step timing and reduced dynamic stability, which results in greater reliance on double support/phase asymmetry, mechanisms linked to elevated fall risk in frail older adults. The AFib group also demonstrated stronger inter-parameter correlations, reflecting compensatory or rigid gait performance, while the balance analysis revealed differences in single-limb support and increased postural asymmetry in the AFib group. Single limb support line, gait length line, and anterior/posterior positioning were also significantly different (PC1= 28.4%, PC2=23.0%), suggesting rigid and less adaptable control strategies. Compared to prior studies, which typically included clinical scales or global mobility indices and reported general mobility/frailty measures, this study transports AFib gait and balance research results beyond descriptive reports to streamlined, quantitative biomarkers targeting modifiable fall-risk mechanisms. Our findings emphasize the need for timely quantitative gait and balance assessment in frail and postoperative adults, towards devising precise personalized cardiac rehabilitation inclusive of gait and balance training and providing a basis for future fall prediction models."

Existing forecasting methods, particularly those based on graph neural networks, are often limited to modeling pairwise relationships between stations, failing to capture the complex, group-wise dynamics inherent in urban charging networks. To address this gap, we develop a novel forecasting framework namely HyperCast, leveraging the expressive power of hypergraphs to model the higher-order spatiotemporal dependencies hidden in EV charging patterns. HyperCast integrates multi-view hypergraphs, which capture both static geographical proximity and dynamic demand-based functional similarities, along with multi-timescale inputs to differentiate between recent trends and weekly periodicities. The framework employs specialized hyper-spatiotemporal blocks and tailored cross-attention mechanisms to effectively fuse information from these diverse sources: views and timescales. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that HyperCast significantly outperforms a wide array of state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicitly modeling collective charging behaviors for more accurate forecasting."

    "abstract": "Cognitive load assessment through electroencephalography (EEG) signals represents a crucial research frontier in brain-computer interface development. To systematically investigate the effects of cognitive load on neural activity, we developed the N-back Task EEG Dataset (NTED) comprising four distinct levels of cognitive load. Traditional convolutional networks struggle to model temporal features in EEG signals due to their unidirectional architectures, while Transformer-based approaches tend to overlook local details when capturing global relationships. Additionally, existing methods generally lack effective modeling of cross-channel spatial correlations. To address these challenges, we proposed a novel Bidirectional Convolutional Transformer Network (BiConformer) that integrates three serial core components: a Bidirectional Convolutional module that extracts local contextual features through past-future signal analysis, a Channel-Spatial Attention module that adaptively adjusts channel relationships, and a Transformer-based module that captures global contextual dependencies. Extensive experiments conducted on NTED and two public datasets demonstrate that BiConformer achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art models. Importantly, we found that BiConformer, using only a small number of prefrontal channels, achieved high classification performance that significantly outperformed other compared methods, demonstrating its robustness in data-scarce scenarios."

    "abstract": "In the realm of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), a key challenge is the coupling between UAV deployment and ground users' (GUs) computation offloading. Malicious aerial eavesdroppers can intercept offloaded data, endangering GUs' privacy. However, most existing MEC secure computation schemes rely on UAVs' trajectories and communication resources, neglecting the collaboration between GUs and UAVs. As such, this paper jointly optimizes computation offloading and UAV deployment in multi-UAV-assisted MEC with an eavesdropping UAV, aiming to minimize system computation cost. We first model the strongly coupled elements using a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game, with UAVs as leaders and GUs as followers. By carefully designing utility functions, we prove both GU-level and UAV level subgames to be exact potential games (EPGs) with Nash equilibrium (NE). Then, a novel hierarchical interactive learning (HIL) algorithm is proposed to reach the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE). The GUs adopt offloading strategies via the best response (BR) theory, and the UAVs learn deployment strategies from the strategy probability vector and GU feedback. Finally, simulation results show that our HIL algorithm outperforms benchmarks, featuring fast convergence, lower system computation costs, and more edge offloading GUs in various scenarios."

However, real-world deployments often face challenges in client selection, especially in the presence of misbehaved clients. Straggler clients with poor connectivity or low resources delay convergence, while malicious clients pose threats to model integrity by injecting poisoned updates. These problems are amplified in dynamic, heterogeneous environments such as those involving consumer biomedical devices. To address this, we propose <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Fed-Reputed</i>, a reputation-aware client selection framework tailored for Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL). Unlike existing reputation-based approaches that suffer from herding effects, cold-start limitations, and imbalanced classification datasets, Fed-Reputed integrates a modified Bellman equation within a Deep Q-Learning framework. This formulation guides client selection using an Imbalanced Classification Markov Decision Process (ICMDP), leveraging both device capability and historical behavior. Extensive simulations using MNIST and FMNIST datasets under varying percentages of straggler and malicious clients demonstrate that Fed-Reputed achieves up to 50% higher global model accuracy and 1.7 times faster convergence compared to state-of-the-art selection methods. Moreover, it significantly improves the detection of misbehaving clients without sacrificing fairness or scalability. These results highlight the potential of Fed-Reputed to advance secure, scalable, and personalized Federated Learning in health-sensitive consumer environments."

    "abstract": "Malicious code detection is one of the most essential tasks in safeguarding against security breaches, data compromise, and related threats. While machine learning has emerged as a predominant method for pattern detection, the training process is intricate due to the severe scarcity of malicious code samples. Consequently, machine learning detectors often encounter malicious patterns in limited and isolated scenarios, hindering their ability to generalize effectively across diverse threat landscapes. In this paper, we introduce MalCoder, a novel method for synthesizing malicious code samples. MalCoder enlarges the quantity and diversity of malicious instances by transplanting a set of malicious prototypes into a vast pool of benign code, thereby crafting a diverse array of malicious instances tailored to various application scenarios. For each malware prototype, MalCoder treats it as an incomplete code fragment and crafts its preceding and subsequent contexts through right-to-left and left-to-right code completion respectively. By leveraging GPTs with various sampling strategies, we can instantiate a large number of code samples bearing the malware prototype. Subsequently, MalCoder masks the original prototypes within the transplanted samples and fine-tunes an LLM code generator to reconstruct the original prototype. This process enables the model to seamlessly transplant malicious code fragments into benign code. During inference, MalCoder can automatically insert malicious fragments into benign samples at random positions, transforming benign code into malicious code. We apply MalCoder to a large pool of benign code in CodeSearchNet and craft over 50,000 malicious samples stemming from 39 malicious prototypes. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses show that the generated samples maintain key characteristics of malicious code while blending seamlessly with benign code, which helps in creating realistic and varied training data. Additionally, by using the generated samples as augmented training data, we witness a remarkable surge in malicious code detection capabilities. Specifically, the F1-score experiences a significant increase compared to utilizing only the original prototype samples."

Through 15 semi-structured interviews with 18 ecosystem actors across public, private, and cultural sectors, analyzed using thematic analysis guided by innovation ecosystem theory and interpretive institutionalism, this study identifies six ecosystem archetypes and five key structural dimensions. Findings reveal two critical tensions: the gap between piloting and sustained implementation, and the conflict between scalability pressures and local value creation. The study shows that ecosystem survival depends heavily on informal \"Ecosystem Connector\" roles and \"Invisible Intermediary\" functions that compensate for structural deficiencies. This critical analysis contributes to innovation ecosystem theory by demonstrating how small innovation economies rely on relationship-based coordination and multi-archetype individuals rather than formal platform orchestration."

With growing interest in AI-driven healthcare, machine learning techniques offer promising solutions for early and accurate ASD detection. However, conventional diagnostic methods are often subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent, especially across varying age groups. The need for scalable, data-driven approaches remains critical for improving diagnostic precision. This study utilizes three publicly available non-clinical datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, covering ASD screenings for adults, children, and adolescents. Multiple machine learning models—Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Naïve Bayes, ANN—and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were implemented for classification. The CNN architecture was designed to capture abstract behavioral patterns effectively across age groups. The novelty of this study lies in the cross-age, model-wise comparison using identical preprocessing and evaluation pipelines. Model performance was assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The results demonstrate that the CNN model outperformed all others, achieving up to 99.53% accuracy, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness for ASD detection across diverse demographics."

This work implements and evaluates five classical root-finding algorithms (the bisection, false position, Secant, Newton-Raphson, and Halley methods) to solve this equation and reconstruct I-V and power-voltage ($\\mathbf{P}-\\mathbf{V}$) curves under standard testing conditions. Simulation results show that Halley’s method offers the best performance in terms of speed and convergence, while bracketing methods provide superior robustness.

It commonly occurs on the face in fifty percent of infants and also on other parts of the body. Early diagnosis of milia is required in infants as milia may affect the infants' skin with permanent injury or damage. In recent years, deep learning has led to substantial advancements in medical image processing, which helps dermatologists detect dermatological diseases more precisely and in less time. However, very few methods are available for the computerized detection of milia. This paper offers a novel approach for Computer-Aided Detection of Milia in Infants (CAD-MI). The proposed CAD-MI approach detects the presence/absence of milia in infants from a dermoscopic image. Its performance is tested with various pre-trained CNN models including Inception V3, VGG-16, AlexNet, and ResNet50 under various experimental settings. In addition, it is evaluated by considering low-resolution and blurry dermoscopic images to show the effectiveness. It exhibits high performance in classifying milia and normal skin condition from dermoscopic image with a classification accuracy of 93%. Thus, the proposed CAD-MI exhibits reliable performance in detecting milia in infants with improved diagnostic accuracy."

Initially, we analyzed the statistical properties of these combined features using the similarity matrix, Euclidean distance, and cosine similarity, revealing insights into the diversity and similarity across species. Boxplots and feature correlation analysis offer a deeper understanding of how texture and chemical characteristics interact in species classification and clustering. These findings provide new insights into plant identification and classification, based on multidimensional data. Finally, we developed a deep learning model for leaf image classification using the ResNet50 architecture. The performance characteristics using texture features alone and both texture and chemical features are analysed.

    "abstract": "Analysing multimodal sentiment Analysis data for exploration on industrial growth and social media is crucial to inducing consumer behavior and purchasing strategies. Based on CapsNet and GRU, this paper describes a DNN for consumer purchase prediction by capturing text, image, and meta-information from social platforms. CapsNet can extract spatial and hierarchical features, and GRU can capture sequential sentiment patterns. The model combines Amazon and Flipkart product reviews while resolving class imbalance and fine-tuning parameters to improve performance. Results from experiments indicate that the model outperforms LSTM and CNN-RNN models in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score and AUC of 0.992, 0.982, 0.985, 0.987, and 0.99, respectively. This model has the potential to improve sentiment Analysis, minimize marketing expenditures, and optimize customer experience, thus making this a solution that is promising for e-commerce."

The personal robotic devices, which use advanced sensor technologies and artificial intelligence, can completely change the lives of people with a wide range of conditions, such as spinal cord injuries, stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases. The goal of AI-driven exoskeletons is to improve both physical and mental health by letting people move around on their own again. This essay looks at the design, usefulness, and effects of exoskeletons driven by AI. It focusses on how machine learning methods can be used to improve movement patterns and adjust to the user's needs. The AI system looks at real-time data from sensors built into the exoskeleton. This lets the motor functions be changed on the fly to improve balance and walking. This study also looks into the problems that come up when trying to make these kinds of systems, like how long the batteries last, how comfortable the users are, and the need for individual customization. Exoskeletons have been shown to help with physical therapy and make patients more independent in clinical trials and case studies. In addition, the paper talks about the future of AI exoskeletons, focussing on how ongoing progress in AI, robots, and biomechanics will make these devices more useful and easy to use. As new technologies are developed, AI-powered exoskeletons could change the way therapy is done and help people with movement problems stay mobile for a long time.

Such conditions typically lead to double-frequency power fluctuations, exacerbating ripples in active and reactive power as well as in the DC bus voltage. These issues can result in power shortages or even grid disconnection.To address these challenges, this paper introduces an advanced control approach specifically designed for PV system inverters connected to the grid. The proposed method is capable of injecting maximum active power even in a two-phase system. To validate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed control scheme, simulations have been conducted. The obtained results demonstrate that the injected current remains balanced, exhibits a sinusoidal waveform with low Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), and ensures stable active power under various fluctuation scenarios, including the disconnection of one phase."

As a result, the implementation of advanced strategies such as virtual power plants (VPPs) are crucial for optimal electricity net profit and ensuring a stable system. This paper proposes a day-ahead optimal scheduling using a rule-based energy management system (REMS). By explicitly integrating market price fluctuations into the decision-making algorithm, the proposed method optimizes energy production, storage, and trading strategies to maximize profitability. Compared with traditional energy management systems (TEMS) that typically prioritize operational stability over economic performance, the proposed method brings higher profit potential to VPPs while maintaining system constraints. The proposed adaptive rule structure emulates optimal scheduling behavior without the computational complexity of mathematical programming, making it suitable for both day-ahead scheduling and real-time market participation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using the IEEE 33-node distribution network."

Traditional ways of matching organ donors with recipients take a long time and rely on limited clinical data, which can cause problems like late matches and less-than-ideal organ use. This study shows a new AI-powered predictive analytics system that can help find the best organ donors and recipients by using machine learning models to guess which pairs will be the best matches based on many factors. The model uses a lot of different types of data, like medical background, organ match, region, and patient-specific factors, to predict how likely it is that the transplant will go well. The framework finds trends in big, complicated datasets using advanced methods like decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. It then gives real-time advice on where to put organs. Anonymized data from hospitals and organ donation agencies are used to train and test the prediction model. This makes sure that it meets ethical standards and increases speed at the same time. Our data show that waiting times have gone down significantly, organs are being used more efficiently, and the success rate of transplants has gone up. The AI-based method looks like it will not only make the current system for organ donation better, but it will also open the door to new ideas in personalized medicine and transplant care in the future. Real-time data integration can make this system even better by making it flexible enough to change to changing patient needs and medical situations.

    "abstract": "Inference of large language models (LLMs) requires extensive matrix-multiplication operations that place heavy demands on both compute and memory resources. Traditional systolic arrays (SAs), typically built from scalar multiply-accumulate processing elements (PEs), exhibit low compute density and high routing overhead when scaled to support the large matrix dimensions of transformer-based models. To address these limitations, we present a hardware-software co-design approach that introduces a coarse-grained \"Big PE\" architecture for FPGA acceleration. Each Big PE performs a complete 4 × 4 matrix multiplication per clock cycle using sixteen parallel multipliers and local accumulators, significantly reducing inter-PE communication and flip-flop usage. We implement a 2×32 array of these Big PEs on a Xilinx Alveo U55 FPGA and tightly integrate the design into the open-source Llama2 inference framework using an XDMA PCIe–AXI bridge. Experimental evaluation with an 8-bit quantized TinyStories-15M LLM shows more than 2.15× improvement in token processing speed during the prompt stage compared to a CPU-only baseline, with no degradation in output quality. Under a fixed budget of 4,096 DSP multipliers, our SA reduces the cycle count for 64 × 64 matrix multiplication from 190 to approximately 120 cycles and cuts total flip-flop usage from 194,560 to 45,056. These results highlight the benefits of hardware-software co-design in deploying LLM inference on resource-constrained FPGA platforms and suggest promising directions for optimizing on-chip memory hierarchies and enabling multi-FPGA scalability."

The segmentation used methods are the Breast Skin-Line Segmentation with transition Points Detection (BSTPD) method and the Iterative Fuzzy Breast Segmentation (IFBS) method [1]. Given the inherent ambiguity associated with breast skin-line detection in mammographic images, we chose to leverage fuzzy theory for the fusion process. To enhance the precision of breast skin-line pixel extraction, we geometrically estimate the membership functions based on the offset separating some particular transition points defined on the intensity profile of the breast pixels. The complementarity of the individual results of the considered segmentation methods justified the use of a disjunctive operator to obtain the final segmented breast image. The performance of the proposed approach was assessed using the Mammogram Image Analysis Society (mini-MIAS) database. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations prove the reliability of our method and its ability to overcome the limitations of each individual segmentation method."

    "abstract": "Segmenting kidney tumors from 3D CT scans is vital for early diagnosis and treatment. The conventional methods for kidney tumor segmentation rely on medical imaging and traditional image processing. The crucial challenges of conventional methods are the requirement of manual annotation, which is time-consuming and prone to human error. Modern machine learning and deep learning-based methods automate the segmentation process. Deep learning-based methods excel in multilabel segmentation, yielding more accurate results than machine learning-based methods. However, these methods require large annotated datasets, are task-specific, and lack generalization across various imaging conditions. Hence, this paper proposes a new method for kidney and kidney tumor segmentation using a transformer-based Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) model. The performance is analysed against the encoder-decoder-based DeepLabv3+ model. The KiTS23 dataset is utilized to assess segmentation performance. Evaluation metrics such as loss and Intersection over Union (IoU) are used for comparison.

Unlike traditional static monitoring systems, adaptable AI systems use data sources to change tracking limits and recognition methods in real time. This makes sure that they are as accurate as possible for all patient types and conditions. Integrating flexible AI into vital sign monitoring has many benefits, such as making it easier to spot problems early, making better decisions, and being able to adjust actions. By constantly learning from new data, these systems can change to each patient's unique health profile. This lets doctors make more accurate guesses about when a patient's health will get worse and act on them more quickly. These systems also allow for online patient tracking, which means that nurses don't have to be with patients all the time. This is especially helpful in critical care settings and for managing long-term illnesses. This essay looks at how flexible AI systems have been created and how they are used in vital sign tracking. It focuses on how these systems affect healthcare delivery, patient safety, and business efficiency. Important problems like data protection, computer bias, and system stability are also talked about, which helps us understand how to get past these problems so that they can be widely used.

In response to the problems of low detection accuracy and poor repair efficiency in traditional data cleaning techniques for processing multi-source heterogeneous power data, this study proposes an intelligent data cleaning framework that integrates an improved isolated forest algorithm and an adaptive BP neural network. By constructing attribute correlation grouping strategies and improving the Isolation Forest algorithm to jointly partition strongly correlated attributes in power data, the anomaly detection rate was increased from 88.2% to 89.7%, and the AUC value was optimized to 0.93 ; The adaptive BP neural network dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on gradients, reducing the root mean square error of data repair by 18.3% and decreasing the number of training iterations by 53%. At the same time, a collaborative architecture of edge computing and cloud is designed to ensure that the processing time of a single piece of data is stable within 12.7ms, meeting the real-time monitoring needs of the power grid. In the UCI standard dataset and actual substation data testing, the detection and repair performance of this framework is significantly better than traditional methods and classical machine learning schemes. The research results provide an efficient solution for power data quality monitoring, and in the future, the adaptability of algorithms in complex working conditions can be further improved by integrating density sensing mechanisms and deep learning models."

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are extensively utilized across various applications due to their capability to collect and transmit data from remote or hard-to-reach areas. Nevertheless, their fundamental limitations render them susceptible to multiple security threats. Among these threats, the blackhole attack represents a considerable danger, wherein a malicious node deceitfully claims to provide the shortest path to a destination and discards all intercepted data packets, impairing the network's operation. WSNs consist of numerous small sensor nodes or motes, which can be randomly deployed in diverse environments. These nodes communicate using a low-power wireless communication medium, as they are significantly constrained in terms of resources. Due to these limitations, nodes within WSNs must collaborate to form a multi-hop network, allowing data to be transmitted across several nodes to reach the sink node. Such radio communications are vulnerable to various attacks. A prevalent Denial of Service (DoS) attack in WSNs is the Blackhole Attack, which engages in the routing process to receive packets from neighbouring motes, only to discard them instead of forwarding them to the intended destination. This type of attack is typically challenging to detect and defend against. In this study, various security schemes have been examined, and through simulations conducted on Contiki's network simulator Cooja, the effects of the Blackhole attack on ContikiRPL (Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks) have been analyzed, focusing on performance metrics such as average power consumption, packet reception count, expected transmission count, and hop count."

    "abstract": "Effective resource allocation is crucial to the efficiency of semantic edge computing (SEC), especially when faced with constrained energy, radio and computational resources. The unique characteristics of SEC, e.g., the demand of multi-task execution and the finite cache capacity of edge servers (ESs), have brought new challenges to the optimization of resource allocation. This paper presents a new dual-timescale deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based resource allocation algorithm aimed at minimizing the long-term average cost of SEC systems. Specifically, cache configurations are learned in the large timescale using Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO). In the small timescale, task offloading and computation strategies are distributively determined at local devices through Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), reducing signaling overhead and offering scalability and reliability. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm reduces the system cost by 33.8% compared to the benchmarks, and can adapt to both latency-sensitive and energy-sensitive tasks by fine-tuning the weighting coefficient."

    "abstract": "Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Tomography (TomoSAR) technology facilitates the extraction of three-dimensional (3D) information of target scatterers. However, phase screens induced by radar platform trajectory errors causes TomoSAR defocusing, which adversely affects the accuracy of the forest vertical structure retrieval. Additionally, the phase screens exhibit space-variant characteristics, which significantly degrade the calibration performance estimated by traditional phase gradient autofocus (PGA). This paper proposes an improved phase calibration method synthesizing unconstrained optimization model and weighted PGA (WPGA), which effectively address the above challenges. Firstly, the SAR data stack is segmented into multiple subareas by assuming that phase screens are space-invariant within each small area, which reduces complexity and improves computational efficiency. Secondly, a WPGA method synthesizing the scatterer heights derived from an unconstrained optimization model is proposed to estimate the phase screens. Simulation experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed phase calibration method. Furthermore, the full-polarization SAR data stacks acquired by the BorTomoSAR campaign are used for tomographic focusing analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately estimates the phase screens at the P, L, and S bands, providing a efficient solution for the forest vertical structure retrieval."

    "abstract": "In the field of the exoskeleton-assisted arm lifting, current research faces challenges such as the lack of a mature assistance strategy paradigm and relatively low torque tracking accuracy. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive torque controller based on an interaction torque model guided by a transparent assistance strategy. The torque controller is designed using the robust model predictive control algorithm, with an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to dynamically adjust the controller parameters. The interaction torque model can estimate future interaction torques to support the model predictive controller. Moreover, the transparent assistance strategy guides the design of the interaction torque reference, ensuring the preservation of the user’s natural exertion patterns during the assistance, thereby creating the sensation of lifting a lighter object for the user. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed transparent assistance strategy effectively maintains the user’s natural exertion patterns while providing assistance. In addition, the proposed adaptive torque controller significantly enhances the torque control accuracy."

    "abstract": "In more electric aircraft, dynamic voltage build-up (VBU) during the transition state is the key to connecting the starter/generator (S/G) function, but an unreasonable VBU process will lead to slow VBU or even VBU failure. To optimize the VBU and avoid failures, this article proposes an improved dynamic VBU control based on power boundary analysis. First, the dynamic VBU two boundaries are divided: 1) the first boundary, where magnetic field power balances power generation, and the VBU can continue; and 2) the second boundary, where it exceeds power generation, exhausting the power of capacitors and causing the voltage to drop to 0 V, resulting in VBU failure. Then, based on the above boundary constraints, the dynamic components that determine the voltage are constrained and compensated, improving the control method of VBU and avoiding VBU failure. Finally, experiments conducted on a permanent magnet-assisted reluctance S/G system verify the accuracy of the analysis. Compared with the traditional method, the proposed method effectively improves the dynamic performance of the VBU and can shorten the original VBU time by more than 1/2, reducing it by tens of milliseconds, which provides space for compressing the startup time of the engine."

UQ identifies critical inputs that govern key performance metrics, including the on/off ratio, forming voltage, and power consumption, reducing their statistical distributions with the probabilities of reliability analysis over 92%. The phase field model captures the morphological evolution of conductive filament (CF) and, by incorporating a second-order time derivative for ion diffusion, reveals the impact of morphological fluctuations governing RRAM behavior. Drift diffusion simulations further demonstrate that bilayer structures confine CF fractures to the HfO<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub> layer through interfacial constraints.

    "abstract": "Robots are increasingly integrated into daily life as consumer electronics. Leveraging the Internet of Things, humans can remotely control robots that function as edge devices to perform various tasks. With advances in artificial intelligence, robots have acquired a certain level of intelligence and autonomy, enabling them to predict human intentions and assist decision-making processes. This study aims to enhance human–robot interactions by proposing an operator intent prediction (OIP) method based on Bayesian filtering. The OIP method integrates data from multiple observation sources and dynamically adjusts the target transition matrix, enabling real-time updates of the prediction probabilities for each target. Consequently, robots can accurately identify the fluctuating intentions of the operator and respond promptly. To seamlessly integrate human intent with robotic intelligence, a shared control strategy for decision-making based on intention prediction is proposed. This strategy introduces a dynamic shared control weight function that adjusts human and robot contributions in real time according to changes in the predicted probabilities of target intentions. This adaptive approach ensures robust performance in complex and unstructured environments. The proposed method was rigorously evaluated using multiple performance metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness and advantages in enhancing human–robot interactions, improving decision-making efficiency, and enabling robots to provide more intelligent and responsive assistance. In addition, we conducted physical experiments in real-world scenarios to further validate the effectiveness of our method."

    "abstract": "The deployment of 3D detectors strikes one of the major challenges in real-world self-driving scenarios. Existing BEV-based (i.e., Bird Eye View) detectors favor sparse convolutions (known as SPConv) to speed up training and inference, which puts a hard barrier for deployment, especially for on-device applications. In this paper, in order to tackle the challenge of efficient 3D object detection from an industry perspective, we devise a deployment-friendly pillar-based 3D detector, termed FastPillars. Specifically, aiming to compensate the geometric information loss of pillar encoding. First, we design a novel lightweight Max-and-Attention Pillar Encoding (MAPE) module specially for enhancing small objects. Second, we propose a simple yet effective backbone design for pillar-based 3D detection, enhancing pillar representations. We construct FastPillars based on these designs, achieving high performance and low latency without SPConv. Extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of FastPillars for on-device 3D detection regarding both performance and speed. Specifically, FastPillars delivers real-time state-of-the-art accuracy on Waymo Open Dataset with 1.8 × speed up and 3.8 mAPH/L2 improvement over CenterPoint (SPConv-based).

    "abstract": "Most existing robotic grasp detection methods can achieve high accuracy in one single domain, but due to the differences in data distribution and object categories among different datasets, the accuracies of these methods decrease significantly in other domains. To solve this problem, we propose a novel domain-invariant grasp detection network with scene prototypes and structure priors to extract robust grasping features. First, a universal prototype guidance strategy, which models the hidden domain scenes and obtains universal scene prototypes based on their similarities, is designed to distinguish foreground objects from background in different domains. The structure perception enhancement method based on structure priors is then constructed to carry out fine-grained modeling of foreground regions and capture more detailed local information. In addition, we also design repulsive constraint regularization to assist the training process to alleviate the issue of similar prior distribution in vector space. Extensive comparative experiments are conducted on four public datasets and the results show that the proposed method achieves significant improvements of detection accuracy under cross-dataset scenarios. As a plug-in module, it could improve the generalization of existing grasp detection approaches by a large margin. Real-world robotic grasping experiments are also deployed to verify its effectiveness."

A data-driven framework based on hybrid regression and classification is developed to determine coefficients of the linear PF equation. This problem is equivalent to minimizing a weighted sum of the root-mean-square error and hinge loss, which compels the linear PF model to enforce network constraints accurately. Simulations with various system scales verify that the proposed PF linearization method outperforms existing ones in terms of decision feasibility and optimality."

    "abstract": "In recent years, there have been significant challenges in the attempt to improve modular structure and code reusability in software development. Software developers should ensure that refactoring not only addresses code smells and provides tangible improvements to software quality metrics. Although metric-based approaches allow for objective and systematic measurements, they have limitations. They cannot ascertain the effectiveness of refactoring techniques in terms of readability, code maintainability, and their impact on system performance and developer productivity. This study proposes mathematical formulations for five key metrics: Modularity (MMo-1-G, MMo-2-S), Analysability (MAn-2-S), Reusability (MRe-1-G), and Testability (MTe-1-G). These metrics were used to evaluate and verify the effectiveness of refactoring in improving module separability and code reuse rate. The proposed model is presented in mathematical notation to link the concepts of modularity and reusability with the corresponding refactoring implementation. Case studies were conducted by applying this formulation to various refactoring techniques aimed at addressing specific types of code smells. Based on the metrics analysis conducted on 17 types of code smell with 3 refactoring techniques, the results demonstrate an improvement in MMo-1-G by 11.46%, MMo-2-S by 0.8%, MAn-2-S by 1.2%, MRe-1-G by 0.82% and MTe-1-G by 3.07%. These findings demonstrate that the proposed formulation can be effectively applied to evaluate code quality changes after refactoring and provide more objective insights into code improvement decision-making."

The ocean is a critical component of the Earth’s climate system, and SST significantly impacts ecosystems and global climate change. However, existing prediction models struggle with the complexities of multi-scale dynamics and nonlinear interactions in the ocean.In this research, we designed a network structure that captures and integrates information across various spatiotemporal scales, explicitly modeling the dynamic dependencies between SST and key factors such as salinity, ocean currents, and wind fields. By employing multi-task learning and attention mechanisms, the model facilitates effective interaction among these factors, improving prediction accuracy and robustness.Experimental results indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional models when validated using the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) dataset, achieving remarkable enhancements in prediction accuracy. The model demonstrates superior performance across different forecast horizons (e.g., 24 hours, 48 hours, and 120 hours), underscoring the importance of multi-factor interaction and spatiotemporal scale fusion. This study contributes not only by providing a new predictive framework but also by offering valuable theoretical support and practical applications for further marine science research and resource management."

Neural network (NN) solutions can adapt naturally to both standard (Gaussian) and amplified (non-Gaussian) IM/DD systems. In contrast to previous research, we examine neural network implementations that incur no increase in complexity over simple, finite impulse response filtering. Comparing standard filtering with our NN solution, our experiments with a silicon photonic modulator in the Oband show gains from 0.25-0.75 dB in Q-factor across multiple wavelengths and fiber lengths. For example, a net rate of 100 Gb/s (post-KP4-FEC overhead) can be achieved at 1300 nm over 3.4 km. We achieved additional gain with a modified four-level constellation adapted to channel statistics. The same-complexity NN solution can be used for amplified IM/DD systems employing low-cost integrated semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs), such as metro/5G fronthaul links, and emerging multiplexing architectures with a shared laser and SOA."

    "abstract": "In the era of foundation models, achieving a unified understanding of different dynamic objects through a single network has the potential to empower stronger spatial intelligence. Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and shape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in biological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the limited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive multi-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an extended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a unified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key innovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer (ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture partitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves) and taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and common anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical shortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces two large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds (about 10 k images with pixel-aligned SMAL labels) and CtrlAVES3D (about 7 k images with pixel-aligned AVES labels). To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for birds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities. Trained on an aggregated collection of 41.3 k mammalian and 12.4 k avian images (combining real and synthetic data), our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks, including the challenging out-of-domain Animal Kingdom dataset. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both our novel network architecture and the generated synthetic datasets in enhancing real-world application performance.

    "abstract": "Mining chains operating in adverse underground environments and experiencing elevated coal transportation volumes are susceptible to critical failures including overloading, chain jamming, and fracture due to their role as essential transmission components. Real-time chain strain monitoring systems provide continuous assessment capabilities and early warning of potential failure events. Conventional strain sensors employed for tension monitoring exhibit significant limitations including insufficient sensitivity, excessive power requirements, and substantial dimensional constraints. In this investigation, we have synthesized strain sensors specifically engineered for downhole applications by leveraging the exceptional properties of graphene and HfSe₂. The integration of HfSe₂ into graphene-based composites resulted in the formation of heterointerfaces, which enhanced the sensors' sensitivity and linearity. These sensors demonstrate superior performance characteristics, including enhanced gauge factor (GF=22.8) within the linear strain range of 0–2000 με, exceptional linearity (RL²=0.98), ultra-low detection threshold (100 με), and minimal power consumption (2.05 mW), while maintaining measurement accuracy across extreme thermal conditions (0°C-60°C). The acquired strain signals underwent Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis, with subsequent application of a Butterworth filter to attenuate high-frequency components and mitigate environmental noise interference. The developed graphene/HfSe₂-based strain sensor substantially enhances monitoring precision and operational safety, presenting significant implementation potential for advanced mine intelligence systems."

    "abstract": "Computational techniques have gained significant traction in photonics, enabling the co-design of hardware and data processing algorithms to drastically simplify optical system architectures and improve their performance. However, their application in optical frequency comb spectroscopy remains considerably underexplored. In this work, we introduce a non-interferometric approach to frequency comb spectroscopy based on dynamically tailored electro-optic modulation. The core of our method is a reconfigurable electro-optic comb generator capable of producing a sequence of known comb spectra to interrogate a spectroscopic sample. Instead of recording spectrally resolved or interferometric data, our system captures a set of integrated optical power measurements-one per probe comb-from which the sample's spectral response is computationally reconstructed by solving an inverse problem. We present the theoretical foundations of this method, assess its limitations, and validate it through numerical simulations. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the experimental reconstruction of several spectral signatures, including a molecular absorption line at 1545 nm. For these results, we use numerically computed spectra and experimentally measured power values, all acquired within 10 milliseconds. Finally, we discuss potential extensions and improvements of the method, as well as its integration into chip-scale spectroscopic systems."

    "abstract": "To better capture real-world epidemic dynamics, it is essential to develop models that incorporate diverse, realistic factors. In this study, we propose a coupled disease-information spreading model on multiplex networks that simultaneously accounts for three critical dimensions: media influence, higher-order interactions, and population mobility. This integrated framework enables a systematic analysis of synergistic spreading mechanisms under practical constraints and facilitates the exploration of effective epidemic containment strategies. Our results show that both mass media dissemination and higher-order network structures contribute to suppressing disease transmission by enhancing public awareness. However, the containment effect of higher-order interactions weakens as the order of simplices increases. We also explore the influence of subpopulation characteristics, revealing that increasing inter-subpopulation connectivity in a connected metapopulation network leads to lower disease prevalence under moderate disease transmission rates. Furthermore, guiding individuals to migrate toward less accessible or more isolated subpopulations is shown to effectively mitigate epidemic spread. These findings offer valuable insights for designing targeted and adaptive intervention strategies in complex epidemic settings."

    "abstract": "Whole-cell, population-based bacterial sensors can be engineered to measure molecular analyte concentrations. Luminescent reporter systems provide an easily measurable optical signal in response to analyte exposure, enabling readout of the aggregate response of the bacterial population. Traditionally, bacterial sensor responses are compared against calibration curves to estimate analyte levels. However, many applications require tracking analyte dynamics over time, which is challenging due to intrinsic molecular noise, population heterogeneity, and the unknown number of cells contributing to the measured luminescence. The stochastic nature of this problem motivates a Bayesian approach, where prior knowledge can be systematically incorporated into inference. In this work, we investigate bacterial sensing within a statistical framework and propose a Sequential Monte Carlo method to infer the posterior distribution over latent system variables. Specifically, we employ a Rao–Blackwellized particle filter to jointly infer analyte dynamics and population cell dynamics from aggregate luminescence measurements. We validate our method on synthetic simulation data and show that the proposed inference is feasible, though associated with relatively high estimation variance. We anticipate that the method is directly applicable in experimental settings."

    "abstract": "Automotive sensors operating in complex environments face both random disturbances (e.g., object occlusion, adverse weather) and deliberate attacks such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing. Traditional localization methods primarily address inherent errors and observation biases caused by random disturbances, but they struggle to effectively counter covert GNSS spoofing simultaneously. To resolve safety challenges from both random disturbances and covert GNSS spoofing attacks in vehicular localization, a resilient localization method for onboard heterogeneous sensors in complex environments is proposed. Firstly, a resilient fusion localization architecture based on onboard heterogeneous sensors is established. Subsequently, building upon this framework, a dynamic optimization method for Kalman filter noise matrices is designed based on an improved Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The approach achieves real-time awareness of random disturbances and enables dynamic correction of noise matrices. Simultaneously, a multi-dimensional localization error quantification metric encompassing spatial and temporal dimensions is established, and a resilient fusion methodology for heterogeneous sensors is proposed. The ablation experiment results show that under random disturbance and covert GNSS spoofing attacks, the localization error of the proposed method is reduced by 12% and 75%, respectively. Meanwhile, comparative experiments with multiple methods validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "The vision to accelerate the commercialization of Open RAN (O-RAN) creates many opportunities for more flexible and cost-effective networks and use cases, but also presents security challenges. Prioritizing security as a critical component of this commercialization, rather than “good enough” protection, is paramount. Splitting the Radio Access Network (RAN) into different, disaggregated functions creates a larger attack surface. As O-RAN drives network component disaggregation and deployments shift from single-vendor to multi-vendor configurations, clear responsibility for asset protection is not just beneficial—it is foundational. Without well-defined roles, the complexity of securing critical infrastructure increases, leading to potential gaps, inefficiencies, and heightened risk exposure. A transparent framework ensures accountability, streamlined security coordination, and effective risk mitigation, making it possible to fortify resilience while enabling innovation and collaboration across diverse vendors. Various single-vendor deployments may use different frameworks to evaluate their security protocols. Shifting to multi-vendor deployments may cause new or existing security risks to emerge due to gaps between different security testing frameworks used throughout the Fifth Generation (5G) O-RAN lifecycle. Due to this potential for security gaps, we offer a Responsible, Accountable, Supports, Consulted & Informed (RASCI) chart as a starting point for what should be a multi-stakeholder series of engagements, which ultimately leads to an objective clarity of assigning risk responsibilities. We also review some of the threats to 5G O-RAN as described by two popular 5G threat modeling frameworks, MITRE’s 5G Hierarchy of Threats ™ (FiGHT) Framework and O-RAN AllianceWorking Group (WG) 11 Threat Modeling and Risk Assessment Technical Report, that are most affected by unclear risk responsibilities, and detail how our suggested risk responsibility framework would help secure against these threats."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive review of coordination methods for addressing large-scale transmission and distribution optimal power flow (TDOPF) problems involving distributed energy resources. With distinct objectives, each transmission and distribution system operator (TSO/DSO) independently seeks to solve its own optimal power flow (OPF) instance. First, iterative methods are reviewed, in which the central OPF is solved recursively by decomposing the full problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems or by replacing peripheral portions of the network within the central OPF with reduced equivalent grids. Generally, the convergence to an optimal solution of the full problem when all sub-OPFs are coordinated is not guaranteed as iterative methods repeat procedures until the changes in control variables of the central OPF are minimal. Second, sequential methods are reviewed, in which the central OPF is solved sequentially in a fixed, nonrepeating procedure by considering previous results. Achieving a fair balance between TSO and DSO interests in sequential methods might adversely affect the performance of a largescale central OPF. The advantages and the limitations of the two coordination methods are presented based on the operation mode of TSO-DSO network. Future research opportunities for coordination methods of TSO-DSO network are drawn using the Kron reduction method and mean-field games."

    "abstract": "Recently, Solanum tuberosum potato production has generated unfavorable impacts on health, the environment and the global economy. This is due to the high demand for tuber and the inappropriate use of agrochemicals on crops. The use of mobile robots for the inspection of soil variables could suggest a more efficient management of these chemical inputs. However, there are still gaps in the development, implementation and automatic control of these agricultural robots. In terms of process control, strategies associated with Active Disturbance Rejection, such as Generalized Proportional Integral (GPI), have been developed. The latter is a promising option of high robustness and performance for robot tracking of desired trajectories. However, the good performance of this type of controller depends on correct parametric tuning. In response to this need, the objective of this work was to determine the optimal parameters of a GPI controller implemented in a S. tuberosum crop inspector robot. For this purpose, a multi-objective optimization problem was formulated that sought the simultaneous minimization of both tracking error and control effort. Subsequently, a methodology based on the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm was implemented, resulting in a set of 18 non-dominated solutions, each with its respective parameterization. The results showed an improvement in trajectory tracking of up to $23 \\%$ over other tuning. Thus, suggesting the effectiveness of this Bio-inspired algorithm to explore the solution space effectively."

The framework employs selective data sharing, communicating only new or updated features between robots. This reduces computational load and communication overhead, preserving mapping accuracy. Efficient alignment techniques address discrepancies in orientation, scale, and reference frames, ensuring proper map integration. This approach empowers AMRs with SLAM capabilities to operate autonomously, improving system robustness and adaptability to individual robot failures.

Due to the wind's unpredictable and variable nature, it remains challenging to forecast wind power accurately.

A novel forecasting model is proposed using an Enhanced Deep Convolutional Neural Network (EDCNN), combined with Demand-Side Management (DSM) strategies. Models that incorporate historical and real-time meteorological data capture the complex spatial and temporal dynamics of wind behaviour to provide more reliable and scalable forecasts. According to comparisons with existing models, the proposed model performs better, particularly in predicting various seasons more accurately. As a result of this research, wind energy can be used more efficiently, and grid operations and energy planning can be optimised."

Among many RNG designs, Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) based Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) are often considered unsuitable for being central components in high-security applications due to their deterministic behavior and shorter cycle length. However, LFSRs are easy to implement and resource-efficient. In this work, a unique approach to using LFSRs for a robust Random Number Generator (RNG) design is proposed for security-sensitive applications. The proposed design utilizes a dynamic selection of feedback polynomials with unpredictable run time, reseeding, and jitter from ring oscillators (ROs) to enhance randomness quality. The design is evaluated through several statistical test suites, for example, NIST SP800-22, NIST SP800-90B, and other randomness tests with near-ideal entropy values. The proposed high-entropy RNG is synthesized on a Spartan-7 FPGA, demonstrating less hardware usage and comparable power consumption. The synthesis result in the Synopsys design compiler also shows high scalability in the advanced technology nodes. Lastly, the proposed RNG design provides a balance between randomness quality and resource efficiency using an LFSR as the main component."

As these models are computationally costly, representative days are frequently used to reduce the problem size. The choice of representative days becomes even more important as variable renewable energy sources like wind and solar are increasingly becoming a part of the electricity mix. Ultimately, the set of selected days will vary based on the method used and number of days chosen. In turn, the outputs of the planning model can vary based on the set of days used - this work focuses on quantifying this variation. First, this paper introduces some existing methods for set selection, weighing additional considerations required when addressing variable renewables and regional variations. A series of metrics is then proposed for comparing the outputs of the planning models from different representative day sets. Finally, they are applied, in PyPSA, to Canada’s Maritime provinces as a $\\mathbf{2 5}$-year grid planning problem and compared to a 365-day approach. Results indicate that there are a wide range of near-optimal solutions with contrasting generation mixes, and that capacity planning would be better informed by generating results over multiple sets of representative days, rather than a single set."

This modulation extends the acquisition range beyond the inherent acquisition range of a conventional bang-bang CDR (BBCDR). In addition to the offset voltage modulation, an offset current modulation is applied to the integral branch of the CDR, allowing for automatic frequency acquisition over the entire VCO tuning range. The prototype CDR is fabricated and measured using a 130nm SiGe:C BiCMOS process and achieves an acquisition range of 49.05 to 52.3 Gbps. The recovered clock is measured at 51.56725 GHz with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$201 \\text{fs}_{\\text {rms }}$</tex> clock jitter, and the recovered data tolerates the applied jitter with a bit error rate (BER) <10-12 in accordance with the data rate and jitter tolerance specifications of the OIF CEI-56G-VSR standard. The CDR core dissipates 245mW from a 3.3V supply voltage, resulting in a Figure of Merit (FoM) of 4.68 mW/Gbps."

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) is a new technology that makes it easy and advantageous to share data with other devices via wireless networks or the cloud. But as the IoT environment evolves, IoT systems are becoming more vulnerable to cyberattacks, which may result in security flaws and malevolent invasions. Various algorithms are used for the detection of intrusions but it often yield low recognition accuracy because due to their failure to effectively handle the massive and novel intrusion data classification with high security. So, deep learning based Multi Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (MGCRNN) is developed in this study to detect the cyber-attacks in IOT network. Initially, the network features during data transmission is collected and it is pre-processed using Median Absolute Deviation Normalization (MADN) and Low Rank Matrix Decomposition (LRMD) for normalization and Missing Value Imputation to enhance its quality. Following that, the dimension of the pre-processed data was reduced using the Curvilinear Component Analysis (CCA) algorithm. The reduced dimension data is then categorized using MGCRNN to detect cyber-attacks. Following attack detection, a homomorphic-based Low Depth Paring Encryption Algorithm (LDPEA) is created to protect data from malicious hackers and securely store it in a cloud server. Then, to access the data from the cloud server, Attribute based Controlled Collaborative Access Control Scheme (ACCACS) is created. The proposed model validates robust presentation with an accuracy of 98.7%, precision and recall of 98.1% and 99% specificity, highlighting its exceptional capability in distinguishing cyber-attacks from benign activities."

This study proposes a method for constructing an intelligent algorithm driven collaborative optimization platform. By integrating digital twins, knowledge graphs, and cloud edge collaboration technologies, a four layer closed-loop architecture of \"perception modeling optimization execution\" is constructed to achieve deep coupling and dynamic interaction between physical systems and virtual spaces. At the algorithm design level, a hierarchical optimization framework combining Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is adopted to solve the collaborative problem of global planning and real-time adjustment within the day. The system's economy and robustness are improved through multi-objective optimization and data augmentation mechanisms. Experimental verification based on IEEE 30 node extended system shows that the proposed platform reduces comprehensive scheduling costs by 12.2% compared to traditional methods in conventional daily scenarios, and the renewable energy curtailment rate decreases from 11.2% to 4.6%; The peak power gap in extreme weather is reduced by 63.6%, and the frequency deviation is controlled within ± 0.12Hz, significantly better than the national standard requirements. The research results have broken through the efficiency bottleneck of traditional centralized control, providing an engineered technical path for collaborative optimization of multi-source heterogeneous resources through precise modeling of digital twins, knowledge graph reasoning, and cloud edge collaborative distributed deployment. Future research will focus on modeling energy storage life loss, fine load prediction, and cross regional multi microgrid collaboration mechanisms, promoting the platform's deepening application towards low-carbon and intelligent directions."

However, the effectiveness of LAAs is heavily dependent on system architecture, particularly in mitigating communication overhead and inefficiencies that can hinder anticipated performance gains. This study investigates the key factors contributing to communication overhead in LAA-enabled architectures, analyzing their collective impact on performance. Specifically, we evaluate critical architectural considerations, including cache hierarchy, data-sharing mechanisms, and communication strategies such as interrupt-driven versus polling-based interactions.To assess these factors, we implement an LAA using an emulated design on an FPGA integrated with ARM CPUs within an AMD MPSoC platform. Through extensive evaluation, we analyze the performance implications of varying data sizes offloaded from an embedded ARM core to the accelerator. Our findings highlight the significant impact of data sizes of workload tasks, the influence of shared memory access patterns, and the trade-offs associated with different design considerations on the communication performance of accelerators. Additionally, this research characterizes communication overhead structures and provides optimization insights for accelerator design, ultimately targeting to enable higher performance in SoCs and MPSoCs with embedded acceleration technologies."

This study presents a robust, production-ready Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that combines deep learning with modular software engineering principles to improve detection accuracy and operational maintainability. The solution utilizes a hybrid CNN-LSTM model, which is trained on actual HTTP/S Load Balancer logs from Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructure within the Pelindo environment, gathered over a one-month duration in July 2025. The model utilizes CNN layers to identify local attack patterns, such as recurrent access to sensitive files (e.g.,. env), and LSTM layers to capture temporal dependencies in multi-stage attacks, facilitating a thorough understanding of threats. The system employs a scalable, real-time architecture: Logstash manages log ingestion and preprocessing, the deep learning model conducts inference, and Kibana facilitates interactive visualization and alerting for operational monitoring. Experimental results indicate outstanding performance, with an accuracy of 99.995%, an AUC of 0.99997, perfect recall (1.0) for malicious activities (zero false negatives), and a single false positive among 19,142 benign requestseffectively reducing alert fatigue while maintaining thorough threat coverage. This study connects advanced machine learning research with practical system deployment by providing a cloudoptimized, maintainable, and interpretable NIDS framework.

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous computing systems, which combine general-purpose processors with specialized accelerators, are increasingly important for optimizing the performance of modern applications. A central challenge is to decide which parts of an application should be executed on which accelerator or, more generally, how to map the tasks of an application to available devices. Predicting the impact of a change in a task mapping on the overall makespan is non-trivial. While there are very capable simulators, these generally require a full implementation of the tasks in question, which is particularly time-intensive for programmable logic. A promising alternative is to use a purely analytical function, which allows for very fast predictions, but abstracts significantly from reality. Bridging the gap between theory and practice poses a significant challenge to algorithm developers. This paper aims to aid in the development of rapid makespan prediction algorithms by providing a highly flexible evaluation framework for heterogeneous systems consisting of CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs, which is capable of collecting real-world makespan results based on abstract task graph descriptions. We analyze to what extent actual makespans can be predicted by existing analytical approaches. Furthermore, we present common challenges that arise from high-level characteristics such as data transfer overhead and device congestion in heterogeneous systems."

FlashAttention has emerged as an efficient algorithm that reduces memory access and enables faster computation while maintaining exact numerical output. However, its implementation has been limited to GPU platforms. In this work, we propose a power-efficient realization of FlashAttention on IMAX3, a linear array-based Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA) that we refer to as Coarse-Grained Linear Array (CGLA) accelerator. By adapting the block-wise computation and memory layout of FlashAttention to the resource-constrained IMAX3 architecture, we demonstrate that efficient Attention computation is possible in a broader range of hardware environments. Our implementation achieves 4–5 times speedup over naive attention, reduces memory usage, and preserves numerical accuracy. Moreover, Energy-Delay Product (EDP) analysis reveals that FlashAttention on IMAX3 outperforms NVIDIA RTX 4090 for short sequence lengths, highlighting its competitiveness in power efficiency."

    "abstract": "Power system restoration following a blackout involves a sequence of actions to recover the network. Restoration planning must take into account the dynamic impacts of each restorative action to ensure that they do not compromise the system’s security. In this work, we construct a frequencyconstrained mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to find fast and dynamically secure restoration plans. We present a novel frequency nadir prediction method that uses the unique knowledge of the magnitude and timing of electrical disturbances during restoration. The predictions are used to introduce frequency nadir constraints, which are linearized through a receding-horizon solution approach to the MILP. A case study simulated in MATLAB and PSS/E illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed frequency prediction and optimization methods."

    "abstract": "Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision impairment globally, necessitating early and accurate detection for effective intervention. This review critically examines the lesion-based paradigm for DR detection, which aligns closely with clinical diagnostic practices by identifying and analyzing retinal lesions such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, exudates, and cotton wool spots. Emphasizing the limitations of end-to-end models, the review explores hybrid deep learning architectures—combinations of CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, ensemble strategies, and traditional machine learning classifiers—that enhance lesion detection accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. It evaluates foundational segmentation models like U-Net, advanced architectures such as EfficientNet and Swin Transformer, and various feature fusion and attention mechanisms. The paper also surveys major public DR datasets, discusses performance metrics for both segmentation and grading, and highlights ongoing challenges including subtle lesion detection, annotation scarcity, and model generalizability. Future research directions underscore the potential of explainable AI, multi-modal learning, and federated frameworks to advance clinically viable and scalable DR screening solutions."

Traditional Proportional-Derivative (PD) controllers, even with gravity compensation, face limitations when dealing with uncertainty and non-linearity. This paper investigates dynamic fuzzy control as a robust alternative to enhance trajectory tracking performance, specifically for the Pelican 2-DOF manipulator. A comparison between dynamic fuzzy control and PD control with gravity compensation is conducted, focusing on performance under unpredictable conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that dynamic fuzzy control outperforms PD control in terms of trajectory tracking accuracy, particularly in dynamic and uncertain environments. The fuzzy controller offers greater flexibility and adaptability, making it more effective in environments subject to external disturbances and variations. The paper concludes by highlighting the advantages of dynamic fuzzy control for trajectory tracking in unstructured environments and proposes future research directions for real-world validation and application in robotic manipulators."

However, these technologies consume substantial amounts of environmental resources, often sourced non-sustainably. This environmental impact remains largely invisible to users, and it is unclear how aware the public is of these environmental costs. The intangible nature of generative AI, like other cloud-based technologies, suggests that awareness of these hidden environmental impacts may be limited. To explore and increase public understanding, we propose ecoAIware, an interactive demonstration using participatory data physicalizations (PDPs). These PDPs represent electricity and water consumption, CO2 emissions, and individuals’ perceptions of the importance of the societal and environmental impacts of generative AI. By embodying these metrics, we aim to engage and inform users in a tangible, interactive way. ecoAIware can spark critical reflection and discussion while also serving as a tool for gathering data on public awareness, thus contributing to the growing discourse on generative AI’s environmental footprint."

    "abstract": "Accurate grade prediction of zinc concentrate is crucial for optimizing the flotation mining process. Traditional methods face challenges, including inconsistencies between froth feature capture and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis sampling times, non-stationary sequences, and asymmetric error costs, which hinder practical applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-scale dilated window attention Transformer (MSDWT) model. The model aligns froth feature sequences with zinc concentrate grade values and applies Z-score normalization to remove non-stationarity. The model incorporates temporal information through a hybrid encoding mechanism and accelerates inference using root mean square normalization (RMSNorm). By integrating information across multiple time scales using multi-scale dilated window attention layers and applying an asymmetric loss function, the training process is effectively optimized. Experimental results show that, compared to existing typical models such as Transformer, Enc-Dec+RNN, STS-D+LSTM, MSFT, and NST, the RMSE was reduced by 22.6%, 12.4%, 11.0%, 9.9%, and 9.3%, respectively."

When a device detects an anomalous parameter at the edge, it queries its local TPHG to identify the most probable temporal precursors. We propose incremental chain formation at each of the devices using <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">LaVE Algorithm</i>, a Lag-aware Viterbi Expansion Algorithm.

Finally, the chain is returned to the initiating device for visualization and analysis. We observe that on emulated IoT hardware, TPHGs load in < 0.1 s and full chains develop in ≤5 s using ∼170MB RAM. TPHGs reduce storage by ∼97.6% versus Conditional Probability Tables. As compared to PCMCI+, LaVE improves macro AUPRC by ≈18% and reduces log-loss by ≈8%, with similar AUROC. These results indicate that on-the-fly chain construction supports real-time monitoring and clinician interpretation of probable cross-device event sequences."

Despite this progress, many existing approaches rely on end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which poses limitations in terms of safety and interpretability, especially when generalizing to novel terrains. To overcome these challenges, we introduce VOCALoco, a modular skill-selection framework that dynamically adapts locomotion strategies based on perceptual input. Given a set of pre-trained locomotion policies, VOCALoco evaluates their viability and energy-consumption by predicting both the safety of execution and the anticipated cost of transport over a fixed planning horizon. This joint assessment enables the selection of policies that are both safe and energy-efficient, given the observed local terrain. We evaluate our approach on staircase locomotion tasks, demonstrating its performance in both simulated and real-world scenarios using a quadrupedal robot. Empirical results show that VOCALoco achieves improved robustness and safety during stair ascent and descent compared to a conventional end-to-end DRL policy."

Taking into account practical considerations including the avoidance of no-fly zones (NFZs) and the weight restrictions of the UAV, our goal is to jointly optimize the pickup and drop-off indicators, lengths of time slots, and horizontal and vertical trajectories, with the objective of minimizing the weighted-sum of completion time and energy consumption. To address the nonconvexity of the formulated problem, which involves mixed-integer nonlinear programming, we first apply a successive convex approximation to transform the nonconvex problem into a convex one for optimization variables. Moreover, we utilize a penalty convex-concave procedure to maintain the binary nature of integer variables. Finally, for the relaxed convex problem, we propose a low-complexity algorithm that derives the suboptimal UAV strategy iteratively. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in establishing 3D trajectories for specific objectives and completely avoiding NFZs while maintaining the binary nature of the pickup and drop-off indicators. Furthermore, the comparative study provides insight into the trade-offs between time-minimization and energy-minimization strategies, offering the flexibility to choose the most suitable approach based on the specific service requirements and objectives."

This growth has necessitated efficient storage, processing, and utilization of this data, which presents critical challenges, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge devices. Data distillation has emerged as a promising solution that reduces dataset size while preserving essential information and optimizing computational resources. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of data reduction techniques, covering methodologies such as knowledge distillation, coreset selection, hyperparameter optimization, and generative modeling.

Furthermore, we examine the implications of data distillation in key areas such as continual and federated learning, privacy preservation, security, healthcare, IoT applications, and edge computing. By enabling lightweight models with minimal computational overhead, data distillation facilitates real-time inference and decision-making on edge devices, making it highly relevant for low-power, bandwidth-limited environments. Data distillation offers numerous advantages in improving model efficiency, reducing training costs, and enhancing privacy.

Since the discovery of the first antibiotics, pathogens have developed different mechanisms of resistance against antibiotics. Today, the technology to understand the mechanisms of AMR and their genomics is more competent than ever. This paper provides a wide range of information about using genomic data combined with machine learning for predicting antibiotic resistance and proposes a multi-model approach ASAP (Antibiotic Susceptibility and Antibiogram Pre diction) for creating antibiograms. In this work, 10 different machine learning models, including Convolutional Neural Network, Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Gradient Boost, and Logistic Regression, have been tested, evaluated, and compared for their predictive capabilities. For data preprocessing, different methods of feature extraction through n-gram encoding have been tested. For the evaluation of the models, accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 scores are used. Experiments show that models can predict the antibiotic resistance of a given pathogen sequence with up to 0.99 accuracy and 0.90+ macro average recall. The best performing model for this work has been XGBoost with 0.99 accuracy, and the least predictive model has been Naive Bayes with 0.89 accuracy. Our proposed method results shows that machine learning with gene sequences are promising tools to improve the current manual antibiogram creation, maintenance process and can provide healthcare professionals with valuable insights for less empirical antibiotic prescribing"

YOLOv10 provides a powerful baseline, but operational efficiency greatly depends on the backbone architecture and its performance. In this study, an evidence-based framework is set, which would help search and rescue practitioners to pick the most appropriate model configurations according to their specific mission profiles and hardware capabilities.We conducted a fully empirical study to understand how to select a model from 8 different backbones, including different versions of EfficientNet, GhostNet, MobileNet, ResNet50, and Swin, across the five YOLOv10 variants from Nano to X-Large on the Search and Rescue Dataset. The results map a clear performance landscape where models are categorized into distinct groups based on the trade-off between inference speed, accuracy, and computational load. For the edge deployment with high constraints, the YOLOv10-Nano with MobileNet backbone achieves the best compromise, at which it exhibits a very high inference speed of 80.5 FPS with 0.3945 mAP@0.5:0.95 accuracy. For server environments with low or no constraints, YOLOv10-XLarge with EfficientNetV2M attained the highest performance of 0.4898 mAP with 29.3 FPS. Yolov-medium with the EfficientNetV2Mbackbone achieved a very good tradeoff between accuracy and speed, with a map@50:95 score of 0.4791 with close to 54 frames per second. Our work highlightshts new light on the trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and complexity of models for more effective and resource-aware object detection systems, thereby speeding up rescue operations."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a low-cost, easy-to-implement sim-to-real framework for biped locomotion that narrows the reality gap using only simulation data, without motion-capture or additional real-world measurements. First, a walking policy for the BRUCE robot is trained in Isaac Gym via reinforcement learning. Next, we develop a compact, physics-informed neural network (PINN) grounded in Euler-Lagrange structure and augmented with an LSTM to predict simulator forward dynamics. Trained solely on simulation trajectories, the PINN forecasts next-step joint angles and velocities of the simulated robot given the physical robot's current state and control inputs. During hardware deployment, and consistent with a whole-body control architecture, these predicted states serve as reference joint states while the policy outputs provide feedforward torque commands; a feedforward-plus-feedback torque controller then computes the executed joint torques, thereby reducing the sim-to-real gap. Experiments on BRUCE demonstrate that our method better reproduces simulated behavior and attains higher tracking accuracy than direct policy transfer. Furthermore, the dynamics predictor runs at 1 kHz on embedded hardware, showing superior real-time performance relative to existing learning-based models."

The limitations of these approaches are well understood and can be summarised as the sole dependent relation with substrate concentration, the encapsulation of rate in a single relevant scalar, and the subsequent lack of functional control that results from the steady-state assumption. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Methods:</i> The Rate Control of Chaos (RCC) is a nonlinear control method that has been shown to be effective in controlling the dynamic state of nonlinear oscillators based on the concept of rate limitation of the exponential growth in chaotic systems. The method is extended with allosteric properties into Allosteric Rate Control of Chaos (ARCC) to allow robust control of the enzymatic process. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Results:</i> ARCC fully replicates the Michaelis-Menten kinetics as well as allosteric control. The emergent dynamics is insensitive to perturbations and noise but susceptible to regulatory adjustments. This method adapts the control parameters dynamically in the presence of a substrate and a ligand, and permits introduction of energy relations into the control function. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Conclusion:</i> The ARCC method more closely resembles biochemical properties of enzyme mediated reactions and removes the need for quasi-steady-state assumptions and allows the modelling of complex dynamic metabolic systems. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Significance:</i> The dynamic nature of the control enables the modelling of the entire complex dynamics of metabolic systems as a large scale free system, potentially addressing metabolic disorders and explain the behaviour of metabolic control."

    "abstract": "We present ClothMate, a general framework for flattening garments of various categories from arbitrary configurations. Prior end-to-end methods are often limited in data efficiency. To address this, ClothMate introduces an intriguing observation: in garment flattening, grasping the same point pair typically results in a consistent fling response, regardless of the current state of the garment. Building on this insight, we adopt a two-stage paradigm: first learning point- wise fling responses under a canonicalized and aligned configuration, then generalizing to arbitrary states via point-to-point projection. This explicit decoupling of state estimation and action prediction mitigates challenges arising from infinite-DOF dynamics and severe self-occlusion, enabling the model to better capture common interaction patterns, thus improving data efficiency to support a broader range of garment categories. Additionally, we propose a novel static pick-and-stretch dual-arm flattening strategy that refines the outcome by heuristically stretching around adaptively selected key points. Compared to the state of the art, ClothMate is trained and evaluated simultaneously on five garment categories, using only 15% of the total data that baselines would require for separate training on all five categories, while achieving higher coverage (91.5% vs. 85.0%) and fewer steps (4.7 vs. 7.0). The code, dataset and trained models are available here."

    "abstract": "Multi-FPGA systems are increasingly popular for low-power, accelerated, rapid, and high-fidelity modeling. However, their performance is often limited by FPGA-to-FPGA communication, which demands reliable, high-speed, and lowlatency links. Existing high-speed links are typically optimized for large-packet throughput, often overlooking the tight latency and bandwidth requirements of small packets. Achieving both low latency and acceptable effective bandwidth for small packets at high line rates is particularly challenging, as even moderate error rates can cause conventional approaches, such as Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ), to collapse under frequent retransmissions. This work addresses the latency-bandwidth trade-off for smallpacket traffic at high line rate by designing a customized serial link in an FPGA-cluster for accelerated neuroscience simulations. The design leverages a hybrid reliability architecture along with co-optimization of reliability, link, and physical layers. The reliability layer combines ARQ with the short block code <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$R S(31,27)_{2^{5}}$</tex>. The RS coding mitigates burst errors caused by the decision feedback equalizer required for high line-rate transmission, thereby improving the ARQ performance. The link and physical layers are designed with minimized latency and bandwidth overhead. The experimental results on two interconnected Alveo U200 boards show that the implemented link achieves 23.73 Gbps effective bandwidth with a router-to-router latency of 148 ns using 28G NRZ transceivers. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a high-speed, reliable, and low-latency serial link optimized for small-packet traffic, highlighting a pathway toward more scalable and high-performance FPGA-based computing platforms."

    "abstract": "With the increasing sophistication of digital environments, users are more likely to download apps without necessarily being aware of the extent of permissions they provide. This in many cases results in unintended disclosure of sensitive information. Current permission management tools are either platform-specific for mobile, transparent, or do not give actionable information regarding app behavior. To improve on these limitations, this paper presents Permission Manager, a web-based application permission analysis and privacy guard. In contrast to other mobile-based solutions, our system is not OS-specific and provides wider accessibility and device-independent analysis. The software enables users to analyze apps based on a comparison of app names and permissions against a pre-filled database, graphically clustering apps by levels of security risk. It also includes functionality like permission comparison, usage tracking, background activity, data leak alarm, and suggesting revoking of dangerous permissions or uninstalls of suspiciously malicious apps. By concentrating on informative visualizations and database investigation, Permission Manager enables users to enhance their privacy impact perception capabilities for the apps installed by them. This solution is a marked advancement over previous systems in providing an enterprise-class, web-based, and feature-rich platform to facilitate user awareness and control in application security."

    "abstract": "In modern digital systems, the memory is the most crucial one in all applications, particularly for signal processing applications, image processing, and networking architectures. This memory process will not be sufficient in all applications; it's producing more error in data writing and reading operations. The error correction and identification methods are also lagging in most cases due to inefficient architecture and testing methods. Thus, this paper analysis an error correction method with a built-in technique called Memory-Built-In Self-Test (MBIST). Methodologies, especially those utilizing MARCH test algorithms, have demonstrated efficacy in identifying both permanent and intermittent errors with hardware overhead. This study provides a thorough comparative analysis of various MARCH test cases, including MARCH X, MARCH C-, MARCH A, MARCH Y, and MARCH B, in relation to SRAM-type FIFO buffers. The efficacy of each test is evaluated based on fault coverage, hardware overhead, testing efficiency, and power consumption. The proposed MBIST structure operates within an FPGA-based NoC environment, its implemented using Verilog HDL and synthesized with Xilinx Vivado on an Artix-7 FPGA. Experimental results demonstrate that MARCH B provides higher level of fault coverage with optimized hardware usage, whereas MARCH X and MARCH Y achieve a balance between efficiency and power consumption. This study improves MBIST implementations, ensuring efficient memory testing with minimized latency and resource constraints, making it suitable for high-performance computing applications."

This study addresses the challenge of limited lecturer utilization of LMS with Single Sign-On (SSO) in higher education institutions. The research aims to describe the growth of creative thinking based on pre-test and post-test results in the Instructional Material Development course, focusing on divergent and convergent thinking dimensions. This qualitative descriptive study involved 110 students from the 2024 cohort of the Economics Education department at a higher education institution in Indonesia. Total sampling was employed as all students in the class actively participated in the learning process under investigation. The analysis was conducted by comparing pre-test and post-test scores using divergent and convergent indicators. The improvement in students' creative thinking was measured separately for each dimension and analyzed using percentage increases. The findings indicate that integrating LMS into the Instructional Material Development course positively influences students' creative thinking. The highest divergent thinking scores were observed in the pre-test, while the highest convergent thinking scores appeared in the post-test. Overall, LMS-based learning was effective in fostering both divergent and convergent aspects of creative thinking. It is recommended that LMS integration be further optimized in the Instructional Material Development course to enhance creative thinking skills among prospective educators."

Statistical and econometric methods, including correlation analysis and logistic regression, are employed to estimate the significance of various factors such as first-year academic results, financial situation, secondary school performance, participation in extracurricular activities while studying at university, and geographical origin. Using data from 2009 to 2024, we identify the main determinants behind the likelihood of graduating from Financial Engineering. One of the significant findings is that students from outside the capital show a significantly higher completion rate than those from Riga, which points to the importance of such factors as motivation, adaptability, and financial constraints. Factors decreasing graduation likelihood include insufficient prior mathematical proficiency, poor performance during the first study year, and financial difficulties, which often lead to dropouts. Conversely, strong academic performance in the first year increases the probability of completing the program. Gender and student mobility programs are also evaluated for their potential impact. The results imply that increasing targeted financial help and offering more comprehensive academic support could improve graduation rates. The findings may be helpful for university administrators to reinforce student support mechanisms, particularly for at-risk groups. Performing the conducted analysis with data on other study programs can further contribute to understanding the factors that might help achieve higher academic success among university students and help RTU refine its educational strategies."

    "abstract": "The US market recently moved to a T+1 settlement cycle, which is quite a big step forward, but the real goal here is achieving real time settlement - basically T + 0 or instant settlement - with the ultimate goal of achieving real-time (T+0) settlement, which could significantly enhance the efficiency and stability of U.S. financial markets. This paper proposes a complete solution for instant trade settlement in the US market. Our approach involves using technologies like Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and Blockchain and combining them with intelligent automation using Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for their analytical power. The system being detailed here is built around a private, permissioned blockchain setup. This approach gives us immutable record keeping and atomic settlement capabilities through smart contracts. What this means is that tokenized securities and cash can be transferred instantaneously. When it comes to Agentic AI, this technology is being looked at to handle various tasks autonomously. Tasks like pre trade validation, managing real time liquidity, optimizing collateral, and dealing with post trade exceptions. These capabilities collectively aim to reduce both operational and counterparty risks. As for LLMs, these will work as intelligent interfaces for monitoring and reporting. They will handle regulatory compliance automation and improve market insights using natural language processing. This whole integrated framework being proposed should help drastically cut down counterparty risk, boost liquidity, reduce operational costs, and make things more transparent and auditable. This paper also tackles some key challenges - regulatory alignment, interoperability issues, scalability concerns, and cybersecurity aspects. This provides a realistic roadmap for where U.S. financial market infrastructure might head in the future. This work introduces a comprehensive framework that brings together permissioned distributed ledger technology, autonomous AI agents, and large language models to streamline regulatory processes. The result is a real-time (T+0) settlement system specifically designed to meet the demands of institutional trading in the U.S. financial markets."

This research introduces an innovative model that integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with Graph Neural Networks (GNN), addressing limitations of standalone approaches. Unlike conventional methods that separately analyze temporal patterns or interrelationships among stocks, this hybrid model processes both dimensions concurrently. This dual capability significantly enhances prediction precision and establishes a fundamental stock market information to validate its effectiveness. By combining the strengths of LSTM in capturing temporal dependencies and GNN in modeling relationships between stocks, the hybrid model achieves notable improvements over traditional machine learning and individual models. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance, evidenced by reduced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values, as well as higher R2 scores, underscoring its accuracy and reliability. This model offers promising applications in domains such as financial forecasting, algorithmic trading, and portfolio optimization. By addressing both the temporal and relational complexities of stock data, the proposed approach sets a new benchmark for predictive analytics in the financial sector. Its ability to provide more accurate forecasts not only supports better decision-making but also opens avenues for further advancements in predictive modeling and financial technology."

Aviation, though contributing only 3% of global GHGs, is expected to triple emissions by 2050 [1]. Electric aircraft rely on battery packs, which require enhanced performance, reliability, and lifespan to ensure safe operation. Hence, the development of comprehensive simulation models of aircrafts is essential for studying and analyzing the battery behavior under various flight conditions. This poster presents a simulation model of the powertrain and aerodynamic behaviour of a small electric aircraft. A mathematical model representing the aerodynamic behavior is developed, which determines the thrust generated by the propeller, and computes the load torque and rotational speed (RPM) for the powertrain model, based on a real-life flight dataset [2]. The motor load torque and RPM are provided as reference inputs to the powertrain control system. The electric powertrain is modeled in MATLAB Simulink and includes two battery packs, an inverter, a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), and a motor control unit. The PMSM is controlled using field-oriented control (FOC), with the RPM as the reference. Proportional-integral (PI) controllers are carefully tuned to ensure accurate tracking of speed and torque profiles."

    "abstract": "Polynomial multiplications in lattice-based cryptography (LBC) can be addressed by number theoretic transform (NTT). To accelerate NTT in hardware, the memory-based architecture is very popular, with butterfly processing elements (PEs) arranged in a 1-dimensional vector (1D) or a 2-dimensional (2D) systolic array. With the growing need to keep data secure and the potential of quantum computers, the demand for energy efficient and high throughput operation is rising. Building on the extensive research in this field, a new systolic vector architecture is proposed in this work, namely the local horizontal folding NTT (LHF-NTT). Unlike forward feeding of data among PEs in the systolic array, the proposed systolic vector locally feeds the output data of PEs back to their input. On one hand, the memory bottleneck is addressed by requiring fewer memory accesses, which also reduce energy consumption. On the other hand, this increase in computational intensity can be used to instantiate more efficient memories of fewer banks, or to increase throughput with more PEs while relying on a classic split into memory banks. The proposed LHF-NTT outperforms 1D-NTT by reducing memory accesses by at least 50% at the same throughput and PE count. In the case of 2D-NTT, the throughput can be doubled while keeping the memory bandwidth unchanged."

Particulate matter is a common and critical pollutant and the negative health consequences it has on people include respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, while also impacting the environment by reducing visibility, harming vegetation, and altering the climate. Existing monitoring systems have low sensitivity, precision and need comprehensive laboratory examination. Therefore, real time particulate matter monitoring and predicting strategies are needed. Machine learning (ML), which makes use of extensive datasets and complex algorithms, provides a potent substitute for monitoring and predicting PM under varying conditions. A particularly effective machine learning methodology that provides a reliable means for enhancing model performance and predicting accuracy is the Ensemble Learning method. Three ensemble learning models are examined in this paper: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost models for predicting PM $\\mathbf{P M}_{2.5}$ levels using air quality data from the Central Pollution Control Board of India. The statistical parameters Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the Coefficient of Determination ($\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}$) are used to assess the model’s performance."

    "abstract": "Transformer fault diagnosis is essential for maintaining the stable operation of power systems. Traditional diagnostic approaches often rely on expert knowledge and face challenges such as inefficient parameter tuning and low sensitivity to minority fault types. This paper presents a transformer fault diagnosis method based on ACGAN and IGWO-GBDT to address these issues. ACGAN is first used to address the class imbalance in the fault dataset. Then, a multi-strategy IGWO is developed by incorporating a nonlinear convergence factor, dynamic weights, and a Lévy flight perturbation mechanism to enhance the efficiency of GBDT hyperparameter optimization. The average fitness value and standard deviation of IGWO on the Sphere function are both better than those of GWO, showing better convergence and stability. Experimental results show that the proposed IGWO-GBDT model achieves a diagnostic accuracy of 97.06 %, with an average recall of 96.03 %, and a minimum recall of 83% across all fault types. Compared with SSA-GBDT, WOA-GBDT, and GWO-GBDT, the proposed model improves diagnostic performance by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{0. 9 8 \\%}, \\mathbf{1. 9 6 \\%}$</tex>, and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2. 9 4 \\%}$</tex>, respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical applicability in transformer fault diagnosis."

The paper provides a comprehensive overview of Rust low-level code generation and identifies an implementation performance gap caused by the current design of low-level abstractions. We propose both hardware and software solutions addressing and eliminating the problem: the former by implementing an additional interrupt/exception return stack in hardware, while the latter by changing the semantics of the riscv-interrupt-m interrupt attribute. As an additional observation we find the performance gap not to be unique to Rust, the problem along with proposed solutions are equally present and applicable to C/C++ as compiled with the latest GCC toolchain targeting the RISC-V architecture."

The most effective strategy to reduce the danger and prevent blindness is to detect cataracts early and accurately. Artificial intelligence- driven cataract detection technologies have drawn interest recently. This research proposes the automatic diagnosis of cataracts in fundus pictures using a novel deep neural network called Cataract Net. In order to train the network with small kernels, fewer training parameters, and layers, the loss and activation functions are adjusted. In comparison to other pre- trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, Cataract Net has a much lower computing cost and average operating time. The Adam optimizer is used to optimize the suggested network. To train the model, a total of 491 fundus pictures—both cataract and non- cataract—are gathered and enhanced to create 612 images. Before training the model, the dataset is expanded by augmentation to prevent the over-fitting issue. With an average accuracy of 97.5%, experimental data demonstrate that the suggested method performs better than the most advanced cataract detection techniques."

This paper analyzes and compares a variety of machine learning models on the task of predicting product demand in the presence of external influencing factors including price offers, promotions, competitor prices, weather conditions, and seasonality. We used an extensive dataset of time-stamped transactions in multiple product categories, with intense feature engineering and normalization. Conventional time series models like LSTM and TCN has compared with ensemble-based machine learning models like Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost. Results show that tree-based models dominate sequence models, and LightGBM has the smallest RMSE (7.87) and WMAPE (4.77%) of test data in 2024. Descriptive diagnostics that include residual plots, correlation heatmaps, performance rankings confirm the efficacy of ensemble models for this problem domain. The findings suggest that hand-crafting non-linear features with the help of external sources has quite predictive power for retail demand."

Improving its energy efficiency is essential for reducing operational costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Energy management systems (EMS) play a key role in monitoring and controlling building appliances efficiently and reliably. With the increasing integration of renewable energy, intelligent EMS solutions have received growing attention. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been explored for this purpose and shows strong potential. However, most RL-based EMS methods require a large number of training steps to learn effective control policies, especially when adapting to unseen buildings, which limits their practical deployment. This paper introduces MetaEMS, a meta-reinforcement learning framework for EMS. MetaEMS improves learning efficiency by transferring knowledge from previously solved tasks to new ones through group-level and building-level adaptation, enabling fast adaptation and effective control across diverse building environments. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaEMS adapts more rapidly to unseen buildings and consistently outperforms baseline methods across various scenarios."

Over the past few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been widely used for tracking the maximum power point. Methods such as Perturb and Observe (P&O), Random Forest, Neural Network and Linear Regression are discussed. Solar PV cells transform sunlight into electricity but are hindered by high initial cost and lower efficiency. Solar cell current-voltage characteristics change with changes in solar irradiance and temperature, which introduce uncertainties on the maximum power point (MPP). For improving the efficiency of PV system and prolong battery lifetime, a microcontroller-based MPPT system is developed to extract the optimum available power under given environmental condition. This paper is a comparison study between different MPPT Algorithms. Of all the MPPT methods, the Random Forest algorithm is recognized for providing good results. The research in this paper is about using an MPPT charge controller with a DC-to-DC buck converter and a controller. The findings show that the proposed MPPT controller enhances PV panel efficiency than traditional charge controllers."

A Voting-Based Ensemble Model and a Hybrid Stacking Model are two of the dual-method machine learning frameworks for weather prediction that this study suggests. Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting (GB), Decision Tree (DT), Linear Regression (LR), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) are the six different algorithms that are integrated into the voting model. The Random Forest base model is merged with Ridge Regression, J48, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and CatBoost in the Hybrid Stacking technique. Both regression and classification tasks are used to train and assess the models. According to experimental findings, Random Forest had the best classification accuracy (88<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">%</sup>) in the voting technique, while the Hybrid Stacking strategy-specifically, the combination of Random Forest and XGBoost-had the best accuracy (90%) in the voting method.

We analyze a 217 -individual weighted social network from the Australian National University, using KONECT data, where edge weights reflect friendship intensity. We apply the SI and SIR epidemic models to evaluate the efficacy of targeting individuals according to degree, strength, betweenness, and weighted betweenness centrality. The weighted betweenness centrality is the most effective strategy for controlling epidemic spread, significantly reducing peak infection rates and network connectivity. However, degree-based vaccination also showed strong performance, offering a practical balance between effectiveness and computational efficiency, making it suitable for broader applications. While degree-based vaccination is effective in slowing down the spread of the disease, weighted betweenness centrality works much more effectively to disrupt key transmission pathways, significantly reducing the size of the largest connected component and aiding in the containment of the epidemic. These findings indicate that network topology and intensity of interaction are critical in designing efficient vaccination strategies and provide grounding for useful suggestions on how to allocate resources and containment efforts in the real world."

To adapt to these changes, there is an urgent need to optimize cost management methods, enhance full-process cost control capabilities, and reduce cost management risks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a data-driven dynamic budget optimization method. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed for data dimensionality reduction, Random Forest algorithms are used to rank key cost drivers, and ANOVA tests are applied to analyze interaction effects. By incorporating dynamic correction coefficients for factors such as copper prices and terrain complexity, a dynamic cost optimization adjustment model is developed. Empirical analysis demonstrates that this method significantly improves cost estimation accuracy and provides robust decision-making support for project management."

To give passengers relevant and helpful recommendations, the system integrates advancements in a number of fields, such as artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and interaction partner filtering. In the first approach, the system analyzes the user's historical travel habits and preferences to suggest destinations that align with their interests using integrated technologies. The second method makes more precise and tailored recommendations by using natural language processing algorithms to comprehend user input for free queries. Furthermore, the system makes use of technology to continuously learn from and modify user suggestions, allowing them to evolve over time to better suit people's requirements.

    "abstract": "Real-time image dehazing is crucial for the reliability and safety of computer vision systems. Despite its effectiveness, the Dark Channel Prior (DCP) algorithm has drawbacks in areas with high contrast or low light levels, which frequently result in noise and colour distortion. To address these issues, Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalisation (CLAHE) is commonly used. The best use of CLAHE as a pre-processing step to support the dehazing algorithm or as a post-processing step to improve the final image, is still an unresolved and unquantifiable design conundrum that presents a crucial trade-off between final perceptual quality and haze estimate accuracy. By methodically assessing CLAHE placement within a DCP dehazing framework that operates in the YCbCr colour space, which isolates brightness for targeted enhancement, this study finds a solution to this challenge. We performed a quantitative frame-by-frame analysis using a special dataset of foggy videos shot in West Sumatra and verified with meteorological data BMKG. Although both setups operate similarly averaging between 4.0 and 4.1 frames per second, they have somewhat different effects on image quality. In comparison to the pre-processing method (average: 5.85), the post-processing setup consistently obtains improved NIQE ratings (average: 5.26), suggesting a more statistically natural and architecturally crisper result. A softer image with poorer overall clarity is suggested by the preprocessing pipeline's marginally higher BRISQUE ratings (average: 54.6 vs. 56.4). This study offers convincing empirical proof that post-processing is the best option for applications that value accuracy and maximum visual detail. A fundamental framework for optimising dehazing systems for important realworld situations is provided by this work."

Cognitive Radio (CR) technology can resolve this critical issue of spectrum scarcity in IoT networks. CR based IoT enables IoT devices to detect and utilize vacant spectrum bands, thereby providing dynamic spectrum access. This is achieved mainly through the use of spectrum sensing techniques, which identifies spectrum holes. Even though different spectrum sensing methods are available in literature, energy detection based spectrum sensing is suitable for resource constrained IoT networks due to simplicity and other desirable characteristics. In this work, the theoretical performance analysis of energy detection spectrum sensing is first carried out in terms of SNR, probability of detection and probability of false alarm, followed by the experimental evaluation using software defined radio (SDR) transmitter and receiver. Finally, a simple prototype of CR-IoT network is developed by transmitting temperature data through LoRa protocol and simultaneously receiving the data by an intended receiver and an SDR to detect unutilized spectrum. In general, this approach paves the way for the next generation of intelligent and self-optimizing IoT networks by addressing the growing demand for connectivity in an increasingly crowded spectrum environment."

Firstly, based on the theory of VSG grid-configuration type control, the primary control model of gridconfiguration type control based energy storage converter is constructed, and through the distributed consistency algorithm, the information interaction between energy storage converters is utilized to coordinate the frequency and power allocation of multiple shunt-connected energy storage converters to realize the accurate tracking of power and frequency.

The simulation results show that the strategy can effectively improve the power quality of the microgrid without relying on the central controller, which enhances the robustness of the system."

    "abstract": "The penetration of Renewable Energy (RE) power generation has been steadily increasing to achieve carbon neutrality. Increases in RE power generation require more secondary reserve (SR) that responds to fluctuations in RE power outputs to balance electricity supply and demand. For power systems with high RE penetration, evaluating the impact of SR provision via interconnections is crucial. This study examines whether SR provision from RE power via interconnections can mitigate the challenges of maintaining supply–demand balance in power systems with high RE penetration. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for evaluating SR provision from RE power via interconnections through simulations, considering both operating costs and RE power curtailment in the assessment. Using this methodology, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the effects of SR provision via interconnections based on the current specifications of a nationwide power system and its balancing areas (BAs). Twenty cases are examined using a demand–supply analysis tool to investigate different configurations of SR provision and interconnection usage of SR exchange. The resulting impacts on system operating costs and RE power curtailment are characterized in detail, bringing further significance to the study. We found that the SR provision from RE power via interconnections reduced the total operating costs and curtailment of RE power output. The flexible usage of interconnections for SR exchange reduces the operation of thermal power units with high fuel costs in each BA, allowing SR provision from thermal power units with lower fuel costs and from RE power sources in other BAs. The analyses demonstrate that SR provision from RE power via interconnections reduces RE curtailment by approximately 40 % and operating costs by around 2 %, highlighting its effectiveness in power systems with high RE power penetration. Therefore, the SR provision from RE power via interconnections contributes to maintaining supply-demand balance in power systems."

The two types of wafers have their own processing routes and processing times at each step. To fully utilize the resources of the CTs, we use the fewest processing modules (PMs) to produce one type of wafers with maximum productivity, and use the available PMs to produce the other type of wafers. Based on this, we introduce a swap sequence for scheduling a dual-arm robot, which is simple to implement and supports periodic operations. Without affecting the priority wafer production, we provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for scheduling a CT that processes two types of wafers, and present the optimal PM configuration. A high-performance algorithm is developed to determine an optimal periodic schedule, with its practicality and feasibility illustrated through several examples."

To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a Chaotic Encryption-based Tunneling Method (CETM) at the network layer. CETM integrates a six-dimensional (6D) hyperchaotic system with the AES-256 algorithm, leveraging the system’s extreme sensitivity to initial conditions to generate high-strength key sequences, eliminating the need for traditional negotiation. A self-synchronizing key update mechanism is also introduced, allowing both parties to update keys automatically without network transmission, thereby eliminating the risk of key leakage. The proposed system demonstrates strong complexity and randomness, as validated by multiple chaotic metrics including the Lyapunov exponent, Shannon entropy, correlation coefficient, permutation entropy, and key space. The generated keys pass both the SP800-22 and FIPS 140-2 tests, meeting established security standards. Performance evaluations across local, cloud, and satellite environments show that CETM significantly outperforms conventional methods in terms of bandwidth efficiency, latency, jitter, and packet loss."

Profiling tools leverage these PMU facilities to analyze program execution. As the computation is increasingly shifting to virtual machines (VMs), commodity hypervisors like KVM have implemented virtual PMUs (vPMUs) to expose these capabilities to VMs. However, we found that KVM's current vPMU implementation introduces substantial overhead, leading to inaccurate measurements. This overhead stems from frequent VM exits caused by PMU access and sampling interrupts, as well as the complexity of emulation. To address this, we develop Direct vPMU (D-vPMU), a novel set of passthrough mechanisms for Intel x86 platforms running KVM. D-vPMU enables VMs to access the physical PMU and handle interrupts directly, thereby eliminating the virtualization overhead that currently plagues vPMU solutions. D-vPMU delivers better profiling accuracy and performance while strictly maintaining the security and isolation boundaries between guest and host PMU contexts."

    "abstract": "Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) technology has been gradually applied to vertical seismic profile (VSP) exploration. The random noise and optical noise with different distributions in DAS seismic records significantly intensify the complexity and spatial non-uniformity of seismic noise, thereby causing instability in the suppression of multi-type noise by deep learning denoising models. To address the challenges in DAS noise suppression, we construct an implicit semantic representation framework to extract fine-grained semantic features from DAS-VSP data, thereby guiding a spatially adaptive generative adversarial network (SA-GAN) to accurately remove multi-type noise while preserving weak seismic signals. Specifically, we construct a category semantic extractor (CSE) to map DAS data into the semantic space, mining the exclusive semantic features of various types of noise by learning their manifold structures. The learned semantic features are introduced into the discriminator, and fine-grained feature discrimination is carried out for different types of noise to form a semantic-spatial interactive adversarial constraint. Meanwhile, the semantic information identified by CSE is embedded into the generator, thereby achieving the adaptive enhancement of directional features of multi-type noise. Additionally, gradient angle loss that reflects the spatial characteristics of seismic wavefield is introduced to jointly supervise the training process of SA-GAN. SA-GAN is tested on the synthetic and field DAS records, and the results show that SA-GAN can accurately suppress DAS noise and improve the recovery ability of weak seismic events."

    "abstract": "High-security intelligent perception systems increasingly rely on heterogeneous sensor fusion, where complementary data from cameras, radars, and LiDARs can significantly enhance multimodal object detection. However, substantial modality discrepancies in resolution, spatial scale, and coordinate systems pose critical challenges for effective cross-modal fusion and spatial alignment. Particularly in dynamic environments with severe viewpoint variations, geometric offsets and semantic misalignments between modalities can substantially compromise detection reliability. To address these limitations, we propose spatial transformation-aware geometric encoding (STAGE), a 2D detection framework that achieves efficient multimodal fusion through three-stage progressive fusion, ensuring spatial consistency and orientation alignment while enhancing detection robustness and deployment flexibility. First, we design a geometric position encoding mechanism based on complex rotational representations, which extends the traditional 2D sinusoidal encoding method and enhances the model’s perceptual adaptability to rigid spatial transformations and viewpoint rotations. Then, in the attention computation module, spatial relative position feature similarity and rotational scale factor are introduced to further improve geometric selectivity and orientation awareness in cross-modal fusion. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our STAGE achieves a detection mAP of 33.3%, with fewer parameters to meet lightweight deployment requirements."

To tackle this challenge, we employ affordable, off-the-shelf IoT devices for reliably detecting face-to-face social interactions. On the detected network, we employ network analysis techniques, particularly PageRank and Betweenness centrality, to propose a novel algorithm that infers social inclusion levels and recommends sustainable interventions aligned with natural interaction patterns, thus ensuring sustainable integration. Our approach addresses the growing need for evidence-based, scalable solutions implementable across diverse educational environments without substantial infrastructure investment.

    "abstract": "The allocation of secure resources in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems has gained significant recognition as a vital research focus in the realm of the Internet of Things (IoT). Previous studies have overlooked the security challenges associated with integrating NOMA with finite blocklength (FBL) transmission. Therefore, this paper examines a secure downlink NOMA system utilizing FBL transmission, which includes a base station (BS), a near user, a far user, and an external eavesdropper. We develop an optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the near user’s effective secrecy throughput, considering the secrecy rates, decoding error probabilities (DEPs), and effective secrecy throughput for both users. Notably, by meticulously defining the DEPs of the users as optimization variables, the monotonicity and concavity of these DEPs in relation to the blocklength, transmission power, and transmission rate can be established effectively. The problem is divided into two sub-problems focusing on the essential conditions for the secrecy rate of the near user, especially in scenarios where successive interference cancellation (SIC) is unsuccessful. These sub-problems are addressed using the block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm and an exact penalty method. For comparison, the BCD algorithm is also applied to solve the optimization problem using the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approaches in improving secure resource allocation when NOMA is combined with FBL transmission."

We showcase the framework for Domain Adaptive Processor (DAP) - an array accelerator designed for signal processing and communication workloads that has near-ASIC energy efficiency. DAP consists of an array of homogeneous Processing Element (PE) clusters, where each PE cluster consists of heterogeneous PEs capable of executing Very-Long-Instruction-Word (VLIW) instructions. We introduce a virtual Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and a sequential assembly to low-level micro-code conversion mechanism. The proposed work includes optimization techniques that transform the low-level micro-code into compact VLIW instructions resulting in an average instruction count reduction by 1.8x and a significant increase in PE utilization. In addition, we demonstrate rate-aware software-based pipelining of the VLIW code resulting in an improvement in throughput by up to 15x for linear algebra and signal processing kernels. Further, we propose a scheduler that is capable of automatically resolving data dependencies between the threads at the micro-instruction level and accurately schedule custom dataflows overcoming the limitations of fixed mapping and scheduling schemes used in traditional CGRA compilers. These contributions together, provide a compilation flow for dynamically reconfigurable array architectures leading to an improvement in ease of programmability and productivity while ensuring low-level implementation flexibility for performance-critical applications."

While deep learning algorithms leveraging the classical Transformer architecture have improved recognition accuracy, a notable gap still exists between current performance and the robustness needed to handle complex lighting conditions and individual variability. To fill this gap, this paper focuses on the scenarios involving low-light conditions and subjects wearing close-fitting clothing. To address this issue, the paper proposes an acupoint localization algorithm tailored to the scenario by employing multimodal data fusion techniques that intergrate thermal imaging with depth map information. The algorithm is based on YOLOv8 and has been architecturally improved, referred to as YOLOv8-TCC. Specifically, a dual-branch parallel backbone network architecture is designed, incorporating the Channel Prior Convolutional Attention (CPCA) module to enhance multimodal feature representation. Next, a Cross-Modal Feature Fusion (CTF) module is introduced to facilitate information integration, while a dynamic template alignment approach is proposed to accommodate variations in body shape and posture. Experimental results show that the YOLOv8-TCC method achieves higher accuracy compared to the traditional single-modal model under varying lighting conditions. With the introduction of the CTF and CPCA modules, the average precision at Intersection over Union (AP@0.75) increased by 2.8% and 0.8%, respectively. Moreover, the success rate under the clinically meaningful 0.5 cun constraint (SR@0.5 cun) reached 95%. It is worth mentioning that our method remains effective when subjects wear light and close-fitting clothing. The proposed method exhibits strong generalizability and scalability, offering an accurate and efficient solution for practical applications."

A filtered based approach is applied to remove the velocity dependency of the controller formulation. Stability of the closed loop system and the uniform boundedness of the tracking error signals are ensured via Lyapunov based arguments. The overall performance of the proposed method is illustrated, initially through physics-based MATLAB/Simscape studies, and then experimentally on a 1 degree of freedom (dof) EHA test-bed and a 2 dof robotic arm."

This paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) enhanced with a squeeze and excitation (SE) attention mechanism for robust DOA estimation. The network integrates the SE mechanism into the convolutional backbone, enabling adaptive recalibration of channels across the real, imaginary, and phase related components of the received signal. By selectively emphasizing channels that encode physically meaningful inter-element phase differences and suppressing those dominated by noise, the network improves angular discrimination and resolves closely spaced sources in low SNR and interference prone environments. Extensive simulations show that the proposed method outperforms conventional approaches, achieving high DOA estimation accuracy and robustness in challenging scenarios involving correlated sources, limited snapshots, and array position errors."

    "abstract": "Expressive dynamics in music performance are subjective and context-dependent, yet most symbolic models treat Dynamics Markings (DMs) as static with fixed MIDI velocities. This paper proposes a method for predicting DMs in piano performance by combining MusicXML score information with performance MIDI data through a novel tokenization scheme and an adapted RoBERTa-based Masked Language Model (MLM). Our approach focuses on contextual aggregated MIDI velocities and corresponding DMs, accounting for subjective interpretations of pianists. Note-level features are serialized and translated into a sequence of tokens to predict both constant (e.g., <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">mp</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ff</i>) and non-constant DMs (e.g., <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">crescendo</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">fp</i>). Evaluation across three expert performance datasets shows that the model effectively learns dynamics transitions from contextual note blocks and generalizes beyond constant markings. This is the first study to model both constant and non-constant dynamics in a unified framework using contextual sequence learning. The results suggest promising applications for expressive music analysis, performance modeling, and computer-assisted music education."

    "abstract": "In this paper, the model reduction approach is investigated for discrete-time linear coupled systems with input delays. For this purpose, a new class of fundamental matrices is presented for state response analysis of this kind of systems. In order to characterize the effect of all initial values, this new fundamental matrix is defined in terms of two independent variables, and thus is called the bivariate fundamental matrix. Besides, some interesting properties of bivariate fundamental matrices are provided. According to the derived state response expression, two particular changes of state variables are constructed to transform the considered coupled input-delayed system into an input-delay-free system. Further, a state feedback controller is designed to stabilize the considered system based on the obtained input-delay-free system. In addition, by using the properties of bivariate fundamental matrices, the characteristic equation of the resulting closed-loop system under the designed controller is explored. The derived results reveal that the designed control law can entirely compensate the input delays, and thus stabilize the considered system."

    "abstract": "Disadvantaged communities lack access to local clean energy sources, which may push them further into energy poverty (EP) during the low-carbon energy transition process. However, traditional methods struggle to accurately evaluate EP and conduct targeted policy intervention. To fully leverage existing resources and reduce the consumption of public funding, this paper proposes an equity-aware peer-to-peer (P2P) market clearing mechanism to mitigate EP. It utilizes the cross-subsidization effect and assists disadvantaged communities in the peer matching process. To facilitate targeted assistance, a novel Large Language Model - Reinforcement Learning (LLM-RL) agentic workflow is developed. An LLM policy intervention agent converts user intent into numerical bidding range, identifies communities in EP and allocates initial carbon allowance. To further lower participation barriers for disadvantaged communities, the P2P trading problem is reformulated as a Markov Game. To adapt to the frequently updated EP signal generated by LLM agent, the RL agents serve as traders for intelligent bidding. Then a cooperative augmented Proximal Policy Optimization (CAPPO) algorithm is introduced to reduce conflicts of bidding strategies and solve the problem. Simulation studies on 99 census tracts with in Florida, United States demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a 19.57% improvement in energy equity."

Utilizing this prior information can significantly improve the prediction and filtering performance of system models. This paper focuses on the reconstruction and state filtering of a linear dynamic system model with destination constraints in the set-valued framework. We treat destination constraints as inherent information in the state evolution process and employ convex optimization techniques to construct a coherent and robust state model. This model effectively captures the influence of destination constraints on state evolution at each time step. To enhance the continuity of the target trajectory generated by the process model, we design an optimal weight matrix for the reconstructed model. Furthermore, we propose a destination-constrained set-valued filtering algorithm, which ensures that the center of the estimated bounded ellipsoid consistently satisfies the destination constraint. Finally, simulation experiments verify its superiority over unconstrained and other state-constrained filtering methods under the set-valued framework."

The primary focus is on user behavior and public adoption intentions towards these services. The findings indicate that performance expectations, perceived ease of use, social influence, and trust are important determinants in driving adoption. The two most widely used theoretical models in this analysis are the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). This second model identifies that perceived usefulness and ease of use are the dominant drivers, while social influence also makes a significant contribution. Based on these observational findings, it is recommended that future research adopt a quantitative approach combined with a qualitative approach within a hybrid model framework to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of digital technology adoption."

Then it was carried out using an approach using statistical calculations using quantitativebased research by looking at the perspective of surveying social media users on the Instagram platform, to comprehensively see the dynamics that occurred, not only from the case study perspective. The results indicate that profile visits have a significant impact on social media engagement. At the same time, accounts reached do not have a significant effect, either directly or through the moderation of total content shared. Additionally, the moderation of content volume does not strengthen the relationship between the independent variables and engagement.

Homomorphic Encryption (HE) offers primitives to compute on encrypted data, but protecting the communication channel with classical key exchange is increasingly exposed to quantum attackers. This work outlines a hybrid model where Paillier HE supports secure additive aggregation, while BBM92 QKD simulation generates quantum-resistant keys for AES-GCM, which in turn protects inter-party communication of HE ciphertexts. The model takes advantage of Paillier HE for secure additive aggregation and simulated BBM92 QKD protocol for generating information-theoretically secure symmetric keys, as opposed to keys obtained from traditional protocols such as Diffie-Hellman. These keys protect the exchange of intermediate homomorphically encrypted values among parties with AES-GCM. We outline the system architecture, Python library-based implementation (Qiskit, phe, cryptography), and simulation results proving the feasibility and improved security against quantum eavesdropping over a fully classical solution. The framework efficiently calculates aggregate sums while maintaining input confidentiality and guarantees communication security that withstands simulated eavesdropping attacks on the quantum channel."

The present study highlights three main developments: miniaturization of devices, energy efficiency, and scalable network architectures. The ultra-compact and efficient devices are developed by using the latest transistors, like FinFETs and Tunnel FETs, alongside novel nanomaterials, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes. The study integrates bio-inspired energy harvesting mechanisms, including piezoelectric and triboelectric nanogenerators, for the purpose of achieving sustainable and self-powered networks. Including techniques that use adaptive transmission, their new framework, supported by molecular and electromagnetic communication paradigms, reduces energy by 50 percent while increasing throughput by 55 percent. These network architectures can be optimized using hierarchical and hybrid models towards enhanced scalability and adaptability with AI-based SDN. The experimental model suggests advanced cryptographic protocols coupled with quantum encryption to solve security issues along the reliable and secure commutation lines. The performance evaluation indicates that molecular communication achieves very good energy efficiency (<10 pJ/bit), while the newly emerged technologies based on quantum principles improve speed and security for future computation applications. The proposed framework enhances reliability, low latency, and energy efficiency, thus setting the stage for disruptive nanoscale networks. Finally, this paper concludes with the assertion that the integration of innovative devices and a sustainable communication approach that has been presented here are necessary steps toward scalable and energy-efficient nanoscale communication systems that meet the demand of future technologies."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the concept of controlling devices using only the mind has been an area of extensive research, particularly in advanced technologies such as brain-computer interface (BCI) based drone control. A key challenge in this field is the classification of electroencephalography (EEG) signals, which are often difficult to interpret due to their low signal-to-noise ratio and interference from various artifacts. Several classification techniques have been developed, typically based on predefined features extracted from EEG band power distributions. However, EEG classification remains complex, as it is highly influenced by experimental conditions and the specific neural responses being analyzed. To address this issue, we introduce a (NeuroPCA-RF) technique designed for EEG/BCI classification and optimization to enhance BCI performance in drone control applications. The NeuroPCA-RF approach focuses on improving signal clarity, minimizing noise, and distinguishing neural patterns associated with different commands. It emphasizes two-stage learning: unsupervised feature reduction and ensemble-based supervised learning. This advancement contributes to the broader development of BCIs for assistive and autonomous systems."

Conventional op-amp-based active filters are often limited in high-frequency applications due to bandwidth constraints, phase distortion, and integration challenges. In contrast, OTA-based architectures provide enhanced tunability through voltage-controlled transconductance (g<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</inf>), enabling dynamic control over key filter parameters such as center frequency, bandwidth, and gain.

This issue can be solved with domain adaptation (DA) methodologies, which worked efficiently with very few labeled samples. In the framework of DA, labeled data from a domain called \"source\" are utilized to design the classification model for a domain called \"target\" having a few labeled samples. Here, we proposed a classification model in DA framework using an effective feature pre-processing technique combined with extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier. We have carried out feature pre-processing in two steps that better captures the essential feature information content and contributed to improvement in the classifier performance. In the first step of feature pre-processing, the deep features of the data set are extracted by a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) followed by fuzzy granulation. Deep feature extraction outputs prominent features, and granulation aligns the feature space of both source and target domain. For the classification, ELM is used as the base classifier which is quick to train. We have evaluated the efficacy of the model using RSSCN7 and UC merced as target and source data sets, respectively, with overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, computation time, precision, recall, dispersion score, and F1 score."

Two Special Golden Alloy electrodes and one Special Conductive Polymer electrode from g.tec medical engineering GmbH (Austria) were used. For comparison, a Wet Adhesive Ag/AgCl electrode was also tested. An artificial electrode-skin interface was designed to allow repeatability and consistent measurement conditions. To compute the impedance magnitude and phase, a frequency band from 0.5 Hertz to 1100 Hertz was examined using a harmonic signal generator with an amplitude of 5 Volts. The resulting impedance-frequency characteristics showed that dry electrodes had moderate to strong resistive-capacitive behavior, which may cause problems in higher frequency biosignal acquisition (e.g. electroencephalogram). However, the results also revealed that the impedance magnitude of the Special Golden Alloy electrodes reached comparable values with the wet adhesive Ag/AgCl electrode in mostly frequencies. The measurement procedure is repeatable, allowing the comparison of various electrode types in the future. Additionally, it is recommended to design a proper in vivo measurement protocol."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a 1200kw solar renewable energy system with integrated green hydrogen storage, aimed at optimizing the production and management of clean energy. The approach is based on the use of photovoltaic generators to generate solar energy, coupled with a 100kw proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer to produce green hydrogen from excess electricity. The hydrogen produced is stored in gaseous form, which can later be used to generate electricity or as a fuel in industrial and transport applications. The system offers an effective solution to overcoming the intermittency of solar energy, and ensures the development of more sustainable solutions to guarantee a cleaner, more environmentally-friendly energy transition. This work explores the modeling and simulation of the system, analyzing its performance and role in a sustainable, low-carbon energy framework. The simulation indicated that the energy obtained from the photovoltaic panels could produce almost 200 kg of green hydrogen per day via electrolysis, enough to power around a hundred electric vehicles every day, with a range of 250 km."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an adaptive packing algorithm for the CXL link layer, designed to dynamically switch between No Packing, 5-Slot, 10-Slot, and Full Packing modes based on real-time traffic intensity. The objective is to optimize the trade-off between bandwidth utilization and latency. Our methodology employs a threshold-based monitoring system to select the optimal packing mode every evaluation window. Results validated against both synthetic and real-world GPU trace workloads show the adaptive algorithm achieves an average bandwidth utilization of 54.9% and an average latency of 3.5 clock cycles. This represents a 174.5% improvement in bandwidth utilization compared to static no packing and a 48% reduction in latency compared to a static Full Packing baseline (Intel’s CXL 3.0) under variable traffic conditions. The primary contribution is a dynamic, hardware-efficient mechanism that autonomously optimizes CXL link layer performance across diverse traffic patterns, enhancing efficiency in memory-intensive applications like AI and high-performance computing."

Actual management of industrial wastewater is crucial for environmental fortification and regulatory compliance. Old monitoring methods, relying on periodic sampling and laboratory analysis, often consequence in delayed finding of contaminants, hindering timely replies to environmental standard violations. This paper recommends a real-time monitoring system that continuously measures essential water quality constraints such as temperature, pH, conduction, nitrate, and ammonia by means of advanced sensors. Information is transmitted in real-time to a cloud-based platform, enabling instant detection of non-compliance and enabling prompt interventions. Transformer-based machine learning representations are employed to predict future water quality trends and detect anomalies, promoting a proactive method to wastewater management. The integration of edge computing progresses system responsiveness by managing data closer to the source, decreasing latency, and providing instant alerts to regulatory authorities and plant operators upon detecting violations. By joining real-time data collection, predictive modeling, and automated reporting, this system aims to development the efficiency, accuracy, and responsiveness of wastewater monitoring, ultimately supporting better environmental management and confirming adherence to regulatory standards"

    "abstract": "In a microgrid with multiple distributed generators (DGs), fault detection becomes challenging due to the diverse fault characteristics of DGs and their control strategies. The control mechanisms of DGs influence fault current magnitudes and dynamics, leading to variations in fault responses across the microgrid. This inconsistency complicates the fault detection process, making traditional protection methods less effective in accurately identifying and isolating faults. An event detection technique based on the integrity of the secured line model is proposed in this paper. The approach concentrates on the mathematical model of the secured line rather than examining the specific fault characteristics of DG. The constraints of the model are used to define a physical quantity, and the model's integrity is evaluated by examining its variation trend in the event of faults. The integrity of the line model is ascertained using the reference voltage, and this technique can serve as the foundation for pilot protection. The method's insensitivity to DG’s fault characteristics is confirmed by simulation."

The variability between various perspectives is often overlooked. This research presents an innovative multi-view clustering strategy to tackle this challenge. It uses concept decomposition theory to use the inherent data information. By using manifold learning, the inherent geometry of the data representation is maintained. The intrinsic geometry of the data representation is preserved through the use of manifold learning. Additionally, the smooth regularization component is used to lessen view overfitting, and the correlation criterion is used to learn the common shared structure from a range of data points. In the end, we aggregate every single variable. An adaptive optimization method based on multiplication techniques is developed to obtain the best solution for the suggested model. Additionally, extensive studies on real-world datasets demonstrate that the suggested approach performs better in terms of clustering than the most advanced clustering techniques."

In this paper, we leverage an automatic pruning algorithm, which can automatically remove less important filters on each layer in a neural network. We conduct evaluations over two real-world datasets for modulation classifications and radio fingerprinting. Our experimental results show that: (1) our method can significantly reduce the number of parameters in a neural network for RF classifications (over 98.19% parameter reduction rate); (2) our method can outperform pre-defined pruning algorithms in previous research; (3) our pruning is compatible with other neural network compression technique (e.g., quantization), which can be leveraged to further reduce model size; (4) our pruned neural networks are extremely small (0.25 MBs) and can effectively perform RF classifications on embedded devices (Nvidia Jetson) and FGPAs (Xilinx ZCU104 board) with real-time inference (0.41 milliseconds per I/Q frame)."

Navigating this expansive design space to identify optimal configurations poses a significant challenge. This work proposes a framework that enables designers to select optimal submodule combinations while efficiently evaluating their PPA implications. It substantially reduces the effort required compared to exhaustive synthesis and physical design of each core variant. By employing optimization algorithms such as Optuna, HEBO, and Ax, our approach systematically selects and assesses submodule combinations to optimize design outcomes. Experimental results show significant improvements in PPA compared to the worst case, with a 74% increase in maximum frequency, a 48% reduction in power consumption, and a 26% reduction in area.

However, the high-depth penetration of VSCs gives rise to small-signal stability challenges due to their control interactions and the variations of system operating points. In the technical literature, small-signal stability of VSCbased power grids is typically assessed using transfer function or state-space models that are linearized around one operating point. These models often require internal system information and/or measurements that are not available in practice, and they need to be updated when the operating point changes. To tackle these issues and facilitate stability assessment of VSC-based grids, a data-driven approach that predicts the system damping ratio is proposed. This approach only needs a reduced set of measurements and is applicable across varying operating points. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed data-driven method is verified based on time-domain simulation studies."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Credit card fraud is a major issue worldwide, leading to huge financial losses and undermining consumer confidence in online transactions. One of the biggest challenges in detecting this kind of fraudulent activity is that transaction datasets are usually unbalanced; there are much fewer fraudulent transactions compared to legitimate, valid ones. In addition to this, fraud tactics keep changing, which makes traditional detection systems based on fixed rules less effective. In this paper, we use a machine learning model that uses logistic regression to predict fraudulent credit card transactions. To address the problem of class imbalance, we incorporate a few resampling techniques in the preprocessing steps, these include random oversampling, random under sampling, and cluster centroid sampling. Our main goal is to assess how these techniques affect model training and prediction performance, particularly improving the evaluation metrics such as recall, precision, and overall accuracy. The experiment shows that performing random oversampling improves the model performance significantly as it gives the best balance between precision and recall. This study exhibits how important preprocessing strategies are for improving fraud detection in practical situations. Overall, this research highlights the necessity of using resampling techniques with machine learning models as a way to deal with heavily imbalanced datasets. In the future, more advanced methods of deep learning and reinforcement learning can be taken up to further enhance the fraud detection capability while also making sure it is scalable, protects security and adapts well for real-time application."

Then the text is pre-processed using five different pre-processing techniques such as tokenization, lowercase conversion, Punctuation Removal, deleting stop words, and stemming. The original text's quality is enhanced by using these pre-processing techniques. Following that, Sentence Part Enhanced-Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer (SPE-BERT) is used to transform words into vector form. Next, the NNMF (Negative Matrix Factorization) is applied to decrease the feature vector's dimension. To predict user sentiment on social media, a deep learning-based Discrete Hopfield Neural Network (DHNN) technique is employed. Hyper-parameters like dropout rate and weight decay are optimally chosen using the Black Hole Optimization Algorithm (BHOA) to improve the DHNN's performance. Simulation analysis shows for dataset 1, the accuracy is 96.1%; for dataset 2, the accuracy is 98.9%; and for dataset 3, the accuracy is 97.4%. The suggested methodology exactly analyses user attitudes for better understand and capitalize on public sentiment, strengthen promotional efforts, and boosting customer participation."

However, with the emergence of large language models (LLMs), it remains unclear how these tools impact users’ decision-making in the context of spam detection. In this study, we investigate the role of LLMs as decision-support tools and their impact on users’ ability to identify spam. We conduct a user study in which participants (N = 295) respond to a total of four emails—two spam and two legitimate (ham) messages. Our findings suggest that prior educational efforts around spam awareness may have positively influenced user decision-making. However, the results also highlight users’ tendency to cognitively offload the task of spam detection onto external tools like LLMs, underscoring the continued need for contextual support to reinforce accurate detection and reduce user vulnerability."

    "abstract": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention for their ability to generate fast and accurate answer to the given query. These models have evolved into large multimodal models (LMMs), which can interpret and analyze multimodal inputs such as images and text. With the exponential growth of AI functionalities in autonomous devices, the central unit (CU), a digital processing unit performing AI inference, needs to handle LMMs to effectively control these devices. To ensure seamless command delivery to devices, the CU must perform the scheduling, which involves resource block (RB) allocation for data transmission and modulation and coding scheme (MCS) index selection based on the channel conditions. This task is challenging in many practical environments in 6G, where even small user movement can cause abrupt channel changes. In this paper, we propose a novel LMM-based scheduling technique to address this challenge. Our key idea is to leverage LMM to predict future channel parameters (e.g., distance, angles, and path gain) by analyzing the visual sensing information as well as pilot signals. By exploiting LMMs to predict the presence of reliable path and geometric information of users from the visual sensing information, and then combining these with past channel states from pilot signals, we can accurately predict future channel parameters. Using these predictions, we can preemptively make channel-aware scheduling decisions. From the numerical evaluations, we show that the proposed technique achieves more than 30% throughput gain over the conventional scheduling techniques."

This research is an attempt to address these issues and suggests the use of RGB image guidance for depth completion of sparse laser point clouds. The presented research work involves three stages. Firstly, to overcome incomplete or inaccurate completion caused by unclear information corresponding RGB image and depth image, a guided convolutional module and a two-stage attention mechanism based on feature fusion strategy are proposed. The strategy uses lightweight network models to improve the completion accuracy. Secondly, a completion method based on the fine-grained convolutional space propagation network is proposed to preserve the original depth value and refine the depth map. This scheme addresses the issue of losing the original depth value due to the noise while fusing two different information input modes of RGB image and depth map. Finally, in order to test the depth completion performance of TFDCNet, evaluation is performed by using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results reveal that TFDCNet shows improved completion accuracy by 8.36% in the selected scenarios comparing with the state-of-the-arts."

To address this issue, we propose a visual annotation-free framework that leverages text-only NER data and a Zero-shot Entity Visual Grounding (ZeroEVG) approach. ZeroEVG consists of three modules: (1) Candidate Object Generation, which pre-selects visual object candidates; (2) Entity-Object Matching, which determines whether an entity has a visual presence; and (3) Entity Visual Localization, which employs a variant of GradCAM to identify bounding boxes for groundable entities. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that our visual annotation-free framework achieves competitive performance with fully supervised multimodal approaches, and even surpasses some of them under the same backbone on both GMNER and EVG tasks."

However, existing approaches suffer from two fundamental limitations: 1) Fixed features fusion architectures exhibit insufficient adaptability to complex environments, and 2) multi-domain features processing inadequately exploits intra-modal information and neglects cross-modal complementary relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RGB-T tracking algorithm called DSTrack. This framework introduces a dynamic switch mechanism that adaptively selects optimal model configurations based on scenario characteristics, enabling structural flexibility for complex environment adaptation. Besides, we propose a multi-domain enhancement network that synergistically combines intra-modal and inter-modal enhancement modules. The intra-modal component employs a tri-domain enhancement strategy (channel, spatial, and frequency domains) to amplify discriminative target features, while the inter-modal module establishes complementary cross-attention links to compensate for single-modal deficiencies. Experimental results show that DSTrack achieves the best performance on four publicly available RGB-T tracking benchmark datasets."

    "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems often rely on autoregressive (AR) Transformer decoder architectures, which limit efficient inference parallelization due to their sequential nature. To this end, non-autoregressive (NAR) approaches aim primarily to achieve significant decoding speedup while the maintaining recognition accuracy that is comparable to AR baselines. This paper proposes a novel NAR block-based attention mask decoder (AMD) that effectively improves decoding efficiency while maintaining ASR accuracy, and also offering flexibility in balancing the performance-efficiency trade-off on both Conformer and large language model (LLM)-based ASR systems. The proposed AMD performs parallel inference within contiguous blocks of output labels while maintaining monotonic left-to-right prediction between blocks. A one-pass beam search algorithm is designed to dynamically fuse Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), AR decoder, and AMD probabilities. Experiments are conducted on normal speech LS960 and DBank elderly speech across: a) The Conformer encoder-decoder ASR system with filterbank input features; b) its integration with WavLM features; and c) further advancement by integrating an LLM-based decoder. On the LS960 task, the proposed AMD empowered tripartite decoder achieves decoding speedup ratios of up to 1.44x, 1.55x, and 2.31x under the three model configurations over the CTC + AR baselines, without statistically significant WER increases. When operating with real-time factors (RTFs) comparable to the baselines, the tripartite decoder produces statistically significant WER reductions of 0.19%, 0.62% and 0.13% absolute (4.3%, 16.3%, and 3.8% relative). Similar improvements are also obtained on the DBank task, where the tripartite decoder accelerates decoding by up to 1.38x, 1.64x and 1.61x without statistically significant WER increase, and yields statistically significant WER reductions of 0.46%, 0.38% and 0.41% absolute (1.8%, 1.8%, and 2.0% relative) when operating with RTFs comparable to the CTC + AR baselines."

    "abstract": "On-device fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) has attracted a lot of attention because of its tailoring personalized models while retaining user data locally on the mobile device. However, it faces significant challenges due to prohibitive memory requirements and slow training speeds. In this paper, we propose MobiLLM, a novel scheme enabling memory-efficient LLM fine-tuning on a single mobile device via server-assisted side-tuning. Particularly, MobiLLM strategically offloads backpropagation computations to an edge server while allowing the resource-constrained mobile device to retain merely a pretrained backbone model with frozen parameters during finetuning. It constructs a backpropagation bypass via parallel adapters decoupled from the backbone. During forward propagation, the device employs low bitwidth quantization for transmitting intermediate activations to the server to reduce communication overhead. The advantage of MobiLLM lies in: 1) confining training data strictly to the mobile device, and 2) eliminating on-device backpropagation while overlapping local computations with server execution. Collectively, MobiLLM ensures the data never leaves the local mobile device while significantly reducing mobile memory and computational burdens. We implement MobiLLM on several popular mobile devices, including NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX and CPU-only laptops. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MobiLLM can enable a resource-constrained mobile device to fine-tune billion-sized LLMs, achieving up to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$4\\times$</tex-math></inline-formula> memory reduction and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2.3\\times$</tex-math></inline-formula> faster convergence as compared to state-of-the-art baselines."

    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis is a crucial task in the field of visualization and computer graphics. Although current methods, such as neural radiance fields (NeRF), have proven versatile for novel view synthesis, they often assume that input views are uniformly distributed in space. This means that each view captures a portion of the real-world scene, with each area being equally represented in the input views. In contrast, real-world scenarios involve randomly captured images with an uneven spatial distribution of input views, where some views of the scene are observed more frequently than others. This discrepancy poses significant challenges for current methods, underscoring the need to address the issue of nonuniformity in practical applications. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new dataset and an effective approach. Our extensive dataset comprises diverse scenes, capturing images in various real-world environments. Unlike previous novel view synthesis datasets, which have uniform or near-uniform input view distributions, our dataset effectively reflects the nonuniform distribution of images in real-world settings. Additionally, we introduce a simple yet effective method that significantly enhances the performance of current techniques under nonuniform conditions without modifying their pipelines. We anticipate that our data and method will serve as a valuable source of inspiration for future research in this area.

    "abstract": "Defects are inevitable on fabric surfaces during the weaving process, and their size is the primary criterion for fabric quality rating. Existing methods primarily rely on computer vision under a single lighting condition to isolate defect pixels from the background, enabling defect contour localization for size measurement. However, due to limited illumination, the shallow features of certain defects remain weak and difficult to detect, even for human observers, thereby compromising the accuracy of the measurement. Moreover, adaptability to the complexity and diversity of fabric defects is constrained by reliance on a single method. To address these challenges, a multi-algorithm collaborative measurement system is proposed, which is supported by an image acquisition platform equipped with multiple illumination sources and designed to decouple and adapt to complex defect measurement tasks. The system, designed for production line deployment, acquires images via alternating flashes from multiple light sources, simulating human vision and enhancing defect saliency to provide high-quality inputs for parallel localization algorithms. Tailored algorithms corresponding to each illumination source consist of training and testing phases for deployment. During training, a normal hyperplane is constructed from fabric images under diffuse illumination, serving as the baseline for defect localization, while the other illuminations assist in detecting defects that diffuse illumination cannot capture, enabling complementary measurement. To evaluate the accuracy of size measurement, the proposed E<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ϵ</sub> is defined as the ratio of the absolute error between the predicted and actual defect dimensions in the warp or weft directions to their sum. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves a size measurement error of 0.16, which is lower than that of existing methods, validating its effectiveness. Additionally, the system is adaptable to fabrics of various specifications and can calculate defect sizes in real time on the production line for practical applications."

This article proposes a thrust ripple suppression method based on quasi-resonant controller-based active disturbance rejection control and deadbeat predictive current control. Quasi-resonant active disturbance rejection control is used to optimize the current instruction, which improves the system's ability to suppress periodic disturbances compared with linear active disturbance rejection control. Quasi-resonant deadbeat predictive current control is used to improve the current loop bandwidth in current control circuits. Compared with traditional DPCC, it enhances robustness through targeted interference compensation. This method not only accurately estimates thrust ripple and optimizes current commands, but also improves the performance of the current loop and enables the timely compensation for thrust disturbances. Therefore, this method maximizes the suppression of thrust ripple. Finally, the theoretical analysis was conducted on the stability and parameter tuning of the proposed QR-ADRC-DPCC thrust ripple suppression method, and the comparative experiments were performed to verify its effectiveness."

However, PowerPoint (PPT) documents are vulnerable to unauthorized photography during presentations, leading to potential sensitive information leakage and copyright infringement. Traditional document security measures, such as password protection and access control, fail to prevent offline photography attacks, while existing digital watermarking techniques face challenges due to PPT's dynamic characteristics and cross-channel distortion. To address these issues, this paper proposes a camera shooting resilient watermarking for PowerPoint presentation. The scheme first selects the master layout backdrop as the watermark carrier according to PPT's compositional features, enabling globally consistent watermark deployment without interfering with document editing functions. By systematically analyzing distortion characteristics during camera-shooting, we identify an optimal frequency band for watermark embedding. Furthermore, a cost-constrained adaptive embedding strategy is adopted to enhance watermark robustness while maintaining imperceptibility. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution effectively resists interference in various complex photography scenarios, providing a viable approach for protecting PPT documents."

However, the growing size of models and their increasing computational demands pose significant challenges, particularly for resource-constrained devices.

These techniques significantly reduce model size by quantizing weights and activations to 1 bit or 1.58 bits, while simplifying computation, making them well-suited for efficient deployment in resource-limited environments. This paper presents a comprehensive review of extreme quantization techniques, organized into three key areas: (1) a comparative analysis of quantizing only the weights (e.g., binary weight networks, ternary weight networks) versus quantizing both weights and activations (e.g., binary neural networks, ternary neural networks), along with a discussion of the progress and trade-offs of their approaches; (2) an examination of how extreme quantization, initially applied to convolutional neural networks, has been extended to Transformer architectures; and (3) an overview of compute-in-memory architectures optimized for binarization and ternarization, including designs based on advanced bit-cell technologies."

A Joint Source and Channel Coding (JSCC) backbone is employed to transmit the low-frequency components of the source image. Furthermore, we introduce a range-space inversion mechanism, which projects the coarse JSCC output into a noisy latent space. This facilitates faithful semantic reconstruction of high-frequency details through conditional diffusion-based null space compensation.

    "abstract": "The occurrence of sea fog leads to a sharp reduction in visibility, posing threats to maritime navigation and port operations. Existing visibility classification methods are predominantly developed for land scenarios, where the categorization of fog conditions remains coarse and is difficult to directly apply to the complex maritime environment. The scarcity of sea fog visibility datasets further exacerbates this challenge. To address these issues, this study proposes a fine-grained sea fog visibility classification network, M-ConvNeXt, designed for multi-level and real-time assessment in support of maritime safety. First, a frequency-domain perturbation strategy was developed to enhance sample diversity and improve model robustness. Then, an adaptive inverted residual block with channel attention was introduced to better extract fine-grained features of sea fog images across different categories. In addition, a maritime visibility image dataset covering six levels was constructed. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ConvNeXt achieves high accuracy and delivers robust performance in fine-grained sea-fog visibility classification, with an average accuracy of 94.59%. This represents improvements of 8.06% over the baseline ConvNeXt-T, 6.83%, 5.97%, and 5.96% over CNN-based ResNeXt, ResNet50 and EfficientNet-B0 respectively, and 2.56% over Swin-Transformer."

Traditional OCR (Optical Character Recognition) systems, although widely used, often fail to extract text cleanly and meaningfully in noisy or skewed images. This research presents a preprocessing-enhanced OCR pipeline, combined with a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model, to benchmark OCR accuracy based on downstream tasks. Using EasyOCR, PyTesseract, and PaddleOCR, we evaluate precision, recall, and F1-score through a fine-tuned RoBERTa token classifier. PaddleOCR achieved the highest F1-score of 0.958, outperforming the rest. Our work proposes an efficient method to evaluate OCR outputs not only on text accuracy but also on their ability to extract semantic information—a practical perspective for real-world automation systems."

    "abstract": "The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in smart technology has revolutionized healthcare, particularly in the aspect of monitoring heart health. The paper dwells into designing intelligent wearable gadgets that use AI algorithms so as to monitor and control heart conditions in real time. These gadgets, such as fitness trackers, phones, and biosensors, continuously collect physiological data from the individual, including heart rate parameters, blood pressure, ECG, and oxygen saturation levels. The AI engine embedded in these gadgets scrapes through these data to detect outliers, generate predictive analyses, and dispatch customized health alerts. Such systems can recognize early cardiac problems such as arrhythmia or hypertension, thereby offering timely treatment while reducing the risk of permanent damage. To make matters better, AI models also allow for continuous learning from an individual's health data, which leads to better prediction accuracy and more adaptive monitoring. Also, the research has studied the main bottlenecks, with hardware issues such as the privacy of data, the accuracy of the AI models, and the possibility of interfacing them with healthcare systems for real-time medical intervention. This essay stresses how important it is for people from different fields to work together when creating these devices, which use AI, sensor technology, and better healthcare practices to make things better for patients.

This study introduces a novel approach for emotion extraction from electrocardiogram (ECG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) signals using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. Unlike conventional emotion recognition methods that rely on facial expressions or self-reports, our model utilizes physiological signals to capture emotional states with high precision. ECG provides insights into cardiac activity, while GSR reflects changes in skin conductance, both serving as reliable indicators of emotional responses. By leveraging advanced signal processing techniques and deep learning algorithms, the model effectively identifies intricate patterns within these biosignals, enabling accurate emotion classification. Experimental validation demonstrates the model’s effectiveness in distinguishing between different emotional states, surpassing traditional methods. This research contributes to affective computing and human-computer interaction (HCI) by enhancing the capability of intelligent systems to recognize and respond to human emotions, paving the way for applications in mental health monitoring, driver assistance systems, and adaptive user interfaces."

Experimental findings show that there is great increase in terms of detection accuracy over traditional systems. The results indicate that image processing and machine learning can be an important step on the way to alter agricultural practice, allowing the farmers to have a more effective model of disease detection, which would be more scalable.

    "abstract": "The dynamic rise of Internet of Things (IoT) applications preconditioned the use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) when the Quality of service (QoS) management and energy efficiency are the most significant issues. In this paper, the QoS management framework based on AI was introduced; the framework is based on the implementation of the Reinforcement Learning (RL) and energy-efficient concepts allowing to optimize both the network performance and the energy consumption in the WSNs. The framework automatically adapts to real-time network conditions and triggers optimal routing, energy savings and real-time response to network dynamics. The outcome of the simulation results demonstrates that the suggested AI-based paradigm is substantial in advancement of QoS measurements. Particularly, there is 30 percent utilization and life extension of networks, 30 percent economization of the amount of energy expended on a per-packet basis, and a 26.67 percent lesser end-to-end delay than with conventional applications. Also, it raises the throughput by 20%, which proves that the AI model can enhance the speed of data transfer. The fact that AI framework can scale well within a large network and the capability of consistently improving the performance of the network parameter is hopeful about using the AI framework in large-scale deployment of IoT. Nonetheless, these advancements have not solved all the problems, in particular, the computational complexity of AI algorithms in low-resource nodes and the environmental effect due to node mobility and interference. The future research will be conducted to cope with these problems to create lightweight artificial intelligence models and enlarge the system robustness to make them applicable in real situations. Conclusively, the suggested AI-based QoS management scheme has a high potential of providing major benefits in terms of energy efficiency and network performance that makes it an opportune method to be used in IoT and WSN applications in the future."

    "abstract": "The neuro developmental disorder of Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) is mostly identified during early childhood. Identifying ASD promptly is crucial through careful observation, assessment and analysis of a child's development in order to provide necessary care and assistance to help him realize his full potential. While many previous studies have focused on diagnosing ASD in adults, early detection remains paramount despite the disorder's incurable nature. In this study, a predictive ASD model for a toddler dataset was presented that utilizes ensemble learning methods such as voting. This approach complements conventional learning methods. The predictive analysis of ASD is carried out in two stages. Firstly, ASD diagnosis is conducted utilizing a set of classification algorithms including Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Bernoulli Naive Bayes (NB) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) based Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the dataset of toddlers. To enhance the performance of the ASD prediction model, in the second stage, the voting ensemble learning approach was used in conjunction with three classifiers at a time from the above base learners. The findings show that our proposed prediction models based on ensemble technique outperform basic Machine Learning (ML) approaches regarding accuracy, recall, F1 score and precision, making them more useful for early-stage ASD diagnosis in toddler datasets. The ensemble model consisting of RF, SVM,NB exhibits highest accuracy of 98.10% with recall, F1 score and precision of 97.89<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">%</sup>, 98.58% and 99.29% respectively."

By leveraging the proximity of fog nodes to end-users and the computational resources of cloud data centers, this architecture can effectively handle latency-sensitive tasks. Game theory provides a robust framework for modeling and solving strategic interactions among distributed network entities. This paper explores game-theoretic strategies for optimizing latency reduction in fog-cloud integration. We analyze cooperative, non-cooperative, and hybrid game-theoretic approaches to resource allocation, task offloading, and service provisioning. Our findings suggest that well-designed game-theoretic models can significantly improve latency while ensuring fairness and efficiency in resource utilization."

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) rank among the leading causes of death globally, accounting for over 17.9 million fatalities annually. Timely diagnosis and accurate prediction of heart conditions are crucial for reducing mortality rates and improving patient outcomes. This research presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework that employs ensemble learning methods to predict heart disease from datasets with imbalanced classes. The study incorporates advanced preprocessing techniques, including outlier management, Box-Cox transformation, and SMOTE-based oversampling. Three ensemble classifiers—XGBoost, Extra Trees, and AdaBoost—were trained and fine-tuned using GridSearchCV. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC indicated that both XGBoost and Extra Trees achieved perfect scores (100%) across all measures, while AdaBoost showed a slightly lower test accuracy of 91.5% and an AUC of 0.98. Analysis of the confusion matrix revealed that XGBoost and Extra Trees had no misclassifications, demonstrating perfect sensitivity and specificity. Additionally, SHAP visualizations were used to interpret the model predictions, highlighting features like Chest Pain, Ca, and Thal as having the most significant impact on the results. Overall, the Extra Trees model was favored for its high accuracy and reduced computational demands, emphasizing the effectiveness of explainable ensemble approaches in enhancing early detection and building clinical confidence in AI-based heart disease prediction."

Traditional differential equation solvers, such as the Finite Element Method (FEM), require domain discretization through meshing and often face challenges with mesh refinement, particularly for sophisticated geometries and high-dimensional problems. Recently, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising mesh-free and data-driven alternative. In this paper, we apply PINN to solve the dynamical equations governing tensegrity structures. By minimizing the residuals of the governing equations along with measured data and initial condition losses, we train a neural network to predict the nodal coordinates over time. Our numerical experiments on the T-bar and lander tensegrity datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can predict complex tensegrity dynamics with high accuracy."

This study, based on the Baltic banking industry survey, examines how digital trust is communicated and which organizational capabilities support its assessment. Four categories of information sources are considered: technical and architectural documentation, reputation-based evidence, external feedback, and blockchain usage as an advanced indicator of transparency. The results indicate that higher capability maturity is associated with broader use of these sources, while advanced transparency indicators appear to play a distinctive reinforcing role in capability development. The findings highlight the importance of complementing established documentation and reputation sources with more sophisticated transparency signals to strengthen internal assessment routines. Practical implications include prioritizing such indicators when seeking to enhance ICT third-party evaluation practices."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an automated technique to identify cardiac diseases by applying machine learning on digitized electrocardiogram (ECG) records. ECG represents an essential method for assessing the electrical and muscular activity of the heart but still requires laborious interpretation, which necessitates experienced personnel. Therefore, the challenges suggest that our proposed method extracts the essential parts of cardiac signals (P, QRS and T waves), and then transforms the ECG's paper record into 1-D digital signal. For example, the digitizing process starts off by splitting up the paper records into 13 leads and then applying smoothing techniques such as thresholding and scaling to convert the signal into binary images. This makes it fit for proposing dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to reduce the dimensions of the dataset while retaining the key features. The signals are classified using machine learning models-k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and also a Voting-Based Model Ensemble Classifier. All these models are evaluated for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to verify normal heart functioning or detect conditions such as myocardial infarction and arrhythmias. Such an automated approach reduces the necessity of manual ECG interpretation and improves the accuracy of diagnosis. This system provides a scalable and reliable solution for the early identification of cardiac diseases by successfully processing and analyzing the ECG signals, resulting in better health care outcomes."

    "abstract": "While modern HDLs such as Chisel (Constructing Hardware In a Scala Embedded Language) significantly improve the process of design entry, debugging these designs is often problematic, because the tools that aid debugging operate on translated code rather than the original HDL. Furthermore, engineers often resort to manual waveform debugging, undermining productivity gains promised by such a language. We present ChiselTrace, an open-source tool for Chisel that is capable of (dynamic) program slicing and automatic signal dependency tracing, allowing faults to be more easily traced back to their root cause. Where prior work focuses on data-flow analysis at the (compiled) Verilog level, ChiselTrace functions at the Chisel source level. Contributions include: modifications to the Chisel library to enable post-simulation analysis; a library capable of dynamic program slicing and dependence graph generation; and a front-end dependency graph viewer. We demonstrate debugging capabilities by tracing an injected fault in the ChiselWatt processor back to the source. We observe that using ChiselTrace's dynamic program dependence graph, the number of lines of code relevant to the fault path is reduced significantly.

The use of the hybrid Cassie–Mayr model and the Chua’s circuit allowed modelling changes in the electric arc conductance, which are the result of unpredictable changes in the arc length due to the behaviour of plasma in a chaotic electromagnetic field. Due to the generation of subharmonic vibrations in the arc furnace system, it is of great importance to develop an appropriate model that would allow for a better understanding of these complex phenomena that negatively affect the power system. The dynamics of the electrical characteristics of arcs contribute to the generation of a wide spectrum of electromagnetic interferences that cause asymmetry, non-sinusoidal and oscillations of current and voltage values in the arc furnace power supply system. The obtained results can be helpful in research leading to the reduction or complete elimination of chaotic vibrations in the considered system."

The methodology was applied to a case study in Nigeria using the IEEE 34 bus system. Solar PV and storage were integrated at proposed sites, restoring system voltages. Solar PV and pumped hydro storage were found to be the most cost-effective solutions. Three potential pumped hydro sites were identified along the Cross River in the Nigerian case study.

These limitations hinder the deployment of such models in real-time or low-resource environments. To overcome the limitations mentioned above, this paper proposes Aqua-Terra Classification using MobileNetV2 (ATCM) from low-resolution satellite images. To improve the quality of the satellite images, the proposed ATCM method entails several preprocessing steps. In this experiment, a CNN model is tested against several other CNN models. MobileNetV2 is found to have the highest accuracy due to its lightweight architecture and efficient feature extraction capabilities, so it is selected for integration into the proposed ATCM method. The ATCM method obtains 96.2% testing accuracy on the pre-processed satellite images."

The primary objectives of this paper are: 1) To develop a sign language production (SLP) system that translates spoken language sentences into Indian Sign Language while incorporating proper co-articulation for natural and fluent signing, 2) To create a Synthetic Indian Continuous Sign Language (SynICS) dataset, which can serve as a valuable resource for future ISL translation research. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we employ an off-the-shelf sign language translation (SLT) model for back-translation, assessing whether the synthetic signs can be reliably converted back into meaningful text. We train this model on the SynICS dataset and evaluate real-life videos from the iSign dataset. Our results are highly promising, achieving a BLEU-4 score of 17.56, with the translated sentences semantically matching the ground truth. These findings demonstrate the potential of synthetic continuous ISL data, generated from isolated signs, to improve Indian SLT task.

However, the existing techniques have several limitations, including inadequate noise reduction, insufficient detail preservation, loss of edge definition, difficulty in understanding intricate patterns, and low model accuracy. Hence, this paper proposes a novel technique to enhance ultrasound images using a modified Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESR-GAN) to overcome the aforementioned limitations. The proposed technique preserves minor details while reducing noise in low-resolution ultrasound images. Its effectiveness has been evaluated using metrics such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), and Mean Squared Error (MSE). These metrics are computed by comparing the generated ultrasound images with the corresponding high-resolution ground truth images. The average PSNR obtained is 65.89 dB, the average SSIM obtained is 0.985, and the average MSE obtained is 0.02. These are compared with the results of ESR-GAN. Comparatively, the proposed technique achieves 24.11% higher PSNR, 8.48% higher SSIM, and 4.54% lower MSE. This implies that the proposed technique achieves a better image quality than conventional methods."

The PINN is trained to adhere to the governing heat transfer physics of the battery-PCM-copper domains while fitting sparse temperature measurements, enabling high-fidelity prediction of temperature distributions without relying on extensive sensor data for an experimental approach or an extensive mesh for a numerical approach. Two models were trained simultaneously to capture the PCM and copper domains, demonstrating the interaction among the battery heat generation boundaries, PCM latent heat absorption through enthalpy change, and thermal conduction through the copper inserts. Validation against experimental measurements across various discharge rates demonstrates that the model can accurately reproduce temporal temperature profiles, including the cell surface temperature and the minimum PCM temperature deep within the pack, with root-mean-square errors below $1^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. Notably, the PINN predicts thermal behavior even at locations where direct instrumentation was infeasible in previous research, highlighting its ability to monitor and detect detailed internal thermal states without being limited by instrumentation or meshing requirements. The results underscore the potential of PINN-based approaches for efficient, real-time modeling of battery thermal management systems that involve phase change and high conductive material domains."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Multiprocessor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) architectures rely heavily on Network-on-Chip (NoC) for efficient inter-core communication. However, large volumes of exchanged data lead to higher latency and bandwidth usage. Approximate communication in NoCs has emerged as a promising solution to address these challenges by tolerating a degree of data inaccuracy for specific application domains. Nevertheless, this tolerance opens new vulnerabilities, particularly to Hardware Trojan (HT) attacks within Intellectual Property (IP) cores or NoC routers. In this article, we address these vulnerabilities and propose a dynamic protection mechanism tailored for approximate NoC communications. We first analyze the threat posed by HT-induced flit drops and demonstrate their severe impact on the system performance. We then introduce DyEKF, a dynamic protection technique that leverages an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to reconstruct dropped flits, minimizing the need for retransmissions. Experimental results show that DyEKF significantly mitigates the impact of HT attacks on the CIFAR-10 database used as an example, achieving up to 2x reduction in retransmission request rates compared to data reconstruction with linear interpolation methods, while maintaining comparable application quality."

However, current approaches to disaggregation suffer from a semantic translation gap: as computation descends the software stack, critical application knowledge—like model structure or execution phases—is lost. This forces an undesirable choice between low-level, general-purpose systems that are semantically-blind and inefficient, and high-level, single-workload systems that are efficient but not general."

To address this, we propose leveraging Certificate Transparency (CT) as a verifiable source of truth regarding a server's security capabilities. Specifically, we introduce a custom X.509 certificate extension that explicitly declares a server's supported protocols, ports, and TLS versions. This information enables clients to detect downgrade attacks. To assess the feasibility of our approach, we conducted a measurement study of DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-HTTPS, and SMTP servers. Our results show that the vast majority of certificates are already logged in CT logs. Building on this, we propose a CT oracle that aggregates data from all CT logs to provide a reliable and comprehensive view of certificates."

We adopt the framework of learning-augmented algorithms and we study the question of whether (possibly erroneous) predictions may help design algorithms with a competitive ratio which is good when the prediction is accurate (consistency), deteriorates gradually with respect to the prediction error (smoothness), and not too bad and bounded when the prediction is arbitrarily bad (robustness). We first consider the non-preemptive case and we devise lower bounds, as a function of the error of the prediction, for any deterministic learning-augmented algorithm. Then we analyze a variant of the Longest Processing Time first algorithm (with and without release dates) and we prove that it is consistent, smooth, and robust. Furthermore, we study the preemptive case and we provide lower bounds for any deterministic algorithm with predictions as a function of the prediction error. Finally, we introduce a variant of the classical Round Robin algorithm, the Predicted Proportional Round Robin algorithm, which we prove to be consistent, smooth, and robust."

However, prior studies merely classify input images into two categories (i.e., stego or cover) and typically conduct steganalysis under the constraint that training and testing data must follow similar distribution, thereby hindering their application in real-world scenarios. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel interpretable image steganalysis framework tailored for invertible image hiding schemes under a challenging zero-shot setting. Specifically, we integrate image hiding, revealing, and steganalysis into a unified framework, endowing the steganalysis component with the capability to recover the secret information embedded in stego images. Additionally, we elaborate a simple yet effective residual augmentation strategy for generating stego images to further enhance the generalizability of the steganalyzer in cross dataset and cross-architecture scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the existing steganalysis techniques for invertible image hiding schemes."

Traditional algorithms relying on remote sensing reflectance (R<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">rs</sub>(λ)) are hindered by considerable uncertainty or invalid values due to imperfections in or the failure of atmospheric correction. This study addresses these limitations by leveraging Machine Learning (ML) to explore Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">rc</sub>(λ)) data towards accurate Forel-Ule Index (FUI) retrieval in the complex atmosphere-ocean environment of the China adjacent seas. First, satellite-ground matchups were constructed with 1,005 in-situ FUI data and quasi-synchronized Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) R<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">rc</sub>(λ) images (0 < Aerosol Optical Thickness < 0.39). Then, machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were compared to identify the optimal one (XGBoost) to construct the FUI retrieval model (XGB-Rrc), with median absolute percentage difference (APDm) and R² of 20.0% and 0.74. Independent validation demonstrates that the new model (APDm = 16.7%) outperforms the existing one (CIE-Rrs, APDm = 50.0%), especially over turbid waters (FUI ≥ 15). Further test over turbid estuaries and bays confirms the general global applicability. Finally, the daily and monthly FUI data products with 1 km spatial resolution for China adjacent seas from 2003 to 2023 were derived from 35,546 MODIS R<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">rc</sub>(λ) images.

    "abstract": "By introducing collision information, the existing side-channel Correlation-Enhanced Collision Attacks (CECAs) performed collision-chain detection, quickly filtered out candidates unsatisfying collision conditions and extracted a part of optimal candidates for further process, thereby rapidly and significantly reducing the key candidate space and the difficulty of key recovery. However, they are still limited by disadvantages such as serial implementation, complex parameter settings and lack of intelligence, resulting in a low success rate of key recovery. To address these issues, we first present a Collision Detection framework with Genetic Algorithm (CDGA), which exploits Genetic Algorithm to detect the collision chains and has a strong capability of global searching. Secondly, we theoretically analyze the performance of CECA, and bound the searching depth of its output candidate vectors with a confidence level using a data-driven hypothesis test that provides confidence bounds for Gaussian leakages and an approximation based on Central Limit Theory (CLT)for non-Gaussian cases, which facilitates effective and stable population initialization. Thirdly, benefiting from our hypothesis-test-guided design, we propose a goal-directed mutation that prioritizes promising collision candidates, thus improving efficiency and adaptability of the CDGA. Finally, to optimize the evolution of CDGA, we introduce a roulette selection strategy to employ a probability assignment based on individual fitness values to guarantee the preferential selection of superior genes. Comprehensive experiments on DPA Contest v4.1 (AES-256 with Rotated S-boxes Masking) and an AT89S52 AES-128 platform demonstrate that CDGA achieves faster convergence and higher key-recovery success rates compared with TOC/FTC/FCC and Wiemers’ cumulative-correlation selection."

    "abstract": "Existing protection methods for DC distribution networks suffer from limitations such as low transition resistance tolerance, noise susceptibility, and inadequate speed. To overcome these challenges, this paper first establishes a bipolar short-circuit fault model that considers multi-converter interactions. Based on this model, we reveal the intrinsic relationship between fault current energy distribution and fault conditions, and propose a novel protection criterion utilizing the Energy Peak-to-Average Ratio (EPAR) of the fault current. By converting the time-domain waveform characteristics of the fault current into energy distribution features, the method effectively characterizes the influence of transition resistance on fault characteristics, enabling rapid and reliable identification of high-impedance bipolar short-circuit faults. An adaptive collaborative protection method leveraging the complementary characteristics of EPAR and current variation is developed. By constructing a dual-criterion coordination mechanism integrating current variation and EPAR, this method enables dynamic setting and complementary identification, ensuring full-line rapid protection for internal bipolar faults. Furthermore, the impact of setting value selection on protection reliability and sensitivity was quantitatively analyzed, constraints in the protection setting process were elucidated, and a theoretical basis for applying the proposed method to DC distribution networks with different structures was provided. A 10 kV multi-terminal flexible DC distribution network model incorporating diverse converters is built in PSCAD/EMTDC to validate the proposed method under various fault conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the method accurately discriminates faults within 1.5 ms after occurrence, achieves transition resistance tolerance up to 100 Ω, and exhibits strong noise immunity."

As the result, this work firstly introduces the Feature Split Attention Module (FSAM), which incorporates maxpooling and spatial attention mechanisms to decouple foreground and background features while preserving critical edge information. Moreover, we propose Global Convolutional Mamba Module (GCMM) that leverages MambaV2 architecture with SSD mechanisms for global feature extraction, thereby enhancing the long-range semantic modeling capabilities. Furthermore, Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) is adopted to strengthen multi-scale feature extraction for diminutive targets.

However, deploying tensor-based models within a federated learning framework faces formidable hurdles in computational efficiency, privacy preservation, and system robustness.

To systematically address these obstacles, we design and implement CSV-FTL, a Cloud-Edge Synergistic Secure and Verifiable Federated Tensor Learning framework. Our framework’s core innovations are fourfold: (1) a natively designed federated tensor model optimized for high efficiency in distributed environments; (2) a lossless double-masking mechanism that achieves strong privacy without compromising model accuracy; (3) a reconstruction algorithm for user dropout tolerance; and (4) a homomorphic hashing scheme enabling users to verify the integrity of server-side aggregation. Consequently, CSV-FTL strikes a superior balance between recommendation accuracy, computational cost, and security guarantees. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to seamlessly integrate a native federated tensor model with lossless privacy, dropout tolerance, and verifiable aggregation within a single, unified framework. Both rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on four real-world recommendation-related datasets validate the provable security and superior performance of our framework over state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Robotic cloth grasping is a key component in many robotic cloth manipulation scenarios, such as automated wardrobe management, clothing laundering, and assisted dressing. Due to the deformability and large surface of cloth, which distinguishes it from conventional rigid targets, most current studies adopt the paradigm of first perceiving the cloth area and then estimating the grasping position in the area. However, current methods overlook the perception sensitivity to illumination variations, leading to performance degradation in low-light conditions or completely dark scenes. In particular, current visual perception methods that fuse RGB and infrared images or are based on low-light enhancement still rely on valid RGB input. Consequently, they cannot be applied to scenes where the lighting becomes extremely low or even completely dark. In this paper, to address the above challenges, we propose a robotic cloth grasping framework based on infrared perception, which includes an infrared semantic segmentation model and a grasping position selection strategy. The infrared semantic segmentation model employs RGB-guided learning to extract features corresponding to RGB information from infrared images. Only infrared images are used as input during inference, enabling robust cloth perception in complete darkness. The grasping position selection strategy is through depth-derived wrinkle analysis via geometric processing. It eliminates dependency on annotated data or task-specific training, remaining invariant to scene lighting conditions. Building on the proposed methods, we developed a robotic cloth grasping system for testing. Extensive evaluation and baseline comparison experiments as well as ablation studies were performed to confirm the effectiveness and superiority of our method."

SNNs process input information in both spatial and temporal dimensions using binary spikes, offering advantages such as low energy consumption and compatibility with neural devices. Previous works have demonstrated that directly training SNNs from scratch has great potential. It can achieve performance comparable to traditional ANNs while significantly reducing energy consumption and the number of required time steps. Moreover, it outperforms ANN-SNN conversion methods. However, prior studies typically employ a fixed timestep during both training and inference, leading to two main problems: 1) During training, it results in complex gradient propagation and gradient estimation errors. 2) During inference, it causes energy waste and performance bottlenecks. To address these issues, we propose a novel strategy called Momentum Performance Queue Training and Confidence Score Inference (<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">MPQ-CS</b>). Firstly, MPQ-CS dynamically adjusts the timestep during the training stage based on the current training performance of the SNN using a Momentum Performance Queue (MPQ). Additionally, MPQ-CS dynamically adjusts the timestep during the inference stage using a Confidence Score (CS) based on the difficulty of input samples. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and different SNN architectures demonstrate that MPQ-CS significantly enhances the overall performance of SNNs during both training and inference stages."

However, most existing studies design trigger patterns as exogenous features introduced to clean samples (such as a checkerboard patch), whereas the endogenous features inherited from sample origins (such as deep generative models) have not been investigated yet. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of utilizing Generative Adversarial Network fingerprints to design trigger patterns by examining three attack patterns: the all-label attack, label-specific attack, and semantic-specific attack. Specifically, we select training data that satisfies the requirements of various attack patterns, train a GAN model, and employ samples embedded with GAN fingerprints to generate poisoned data sets. Our evaluations on three data sets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and LSUN) demonstrate that employing GAN fingerprints as trigger patterns 1) can achieve average attack success rate results of 39.40% in all-label attack, 89.84% in label-specific attack, and 91.06% in semantic-specific attack, 2) is stealthy by reducing the probability of being exposed, and 3) can resist six existing backdoor detection techniques, three backdoor erasing techniques, and two deepfake detection techniques. Furthermore, it exhibits practical applicability in federated learning scenario."
